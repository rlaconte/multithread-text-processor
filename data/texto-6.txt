old
warrior
and
says
he
means
them
no
unkindness
and
will
walk
with
them
such
a
favourable
opportunity
must
in
no
wise
be
missed
so
the
old
soldier
prophet
gives
them
his
mind
upon
the
wickedness
of
slave
holding
and
the
meanness
of
slave
hunting
which
discourse
let
us
hope
is
not
wholly
unfruitful
when
he
has
held
them
for
one
night
he
thinks
they
have
been
brought
far
enough
from
their
haunts
to
prevent
further
mischief
and
sets
them
free
that
one
night
spent
with
him
they
are
not
likely
to
forget
he
would
not
so
much
as
allow
them
the
privilege
of
swearing
no
taking
of
god
s
name
in
vain
gentlemen
if
there
is
a
god
you
will
gain
nothing
and
if
there
is
none
you
are
fools
indeed
one
of
them
a
harum
scarum
young
physician
is
taken
specially
under
charge
by
john
brown
before
retiring
brown
desires
him
to
pray
i
ca
nt
pray
he
says
with
an
oath
what
did
your
mother
never
teach
you
asks
brown
oh
yes
he
replies
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
well
you
still
remember
the
prayer
she
taught
you
continued
brown
yes
is
the
answer
say
that
for
want
of
a
better
is
the
order
then
to
the
amusement
of
all
the
poor
doctor
repeats
the
rhyme
and
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
i
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
keep
said
the
young
doctor
after
he
was
released
john
brown
knows
more
about
religion
than
any
man
i
ever
met
he
never
used
harsh
language
we
were
treated
like
gentlemen
we
shared
food
with
them
only
it
went
against
the
grain
to
as
they
get
farther
north
there
is
more
bark
than
bite
about
the
opposition
they
encounter
in
the
street
at
one
town
where
they
are
sheltered
brown
strolls
alone
and
finds
a
champion
of
slavery
haranguing
the
crowd
and
denouncing
brown
as
a
reckless
bloody
outlaw
a
coward
who
skulked
and
would
never
fight
in
the
open
warming
to
a
climax
the
orator
proclaims
if
i
could
get
a
sight
of
him
i
would
shoot
him
on
the
spot
i
would
never
give
him
a
chance
to
steal
any
more
slaves
my
friend
says
a
plain
looking
countryman
no
other
than
john
brown
himself
on
the
outskirts
of
the
throng
you
talk
very
brave
and
as
you
will
never
have
a
better
opportunity
to
shoot
old
brown
than
right
here
and
now
you
can
have
a
chance
but
his
powder
was
damped
or
his
courage
now
the
journey
is
over
the
twelve
fugitives

become

for
a

conducts
them
safely
across
the
ferry
and
places
them
under

shelter
of

on
the
canadian
shore
then
the
old
man
reverently
pronounces
his
nunc

now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
thy

should

that

the

us
before
many
months
those
rescued
ones
were

at

condemned
to

were
saying

chapter

harper
s
ferry
john
brown
now
prepared
for
his
final
effort
for
the
enterprise
he
had
espoused
and
the
sacrifice
he
had
sworn
to
make
for
it
were
to
be
completed
by
his
death
there
is
no
way
of
deliverance
but
by
blood
had
become
it
seemed
so
the
slave
states
were
waxing
fiercer
in
their
unholy
enterprise
the
reopening
of
the
market
for
freshly
imported
slaves
from
africa
was
openly
advocated
indeed
prices
were
offered
for
the
best
specimens
as
if
it
were
a
mere
cattle
trade
for
sale
negroes
just
landed
was
placarded
in
southern
streets
and
to
complete
the
grim
situation
a
prize
was
proposed
for
the
best
sermon
in
defence
of
the
slave
trade
surely
the
lord
gave
not
the
word
but
great
was
the
company
of
the
preachers
who
were
prepared
to
publish
it
john
brown
felt
that
the
fullness
of
time
was
come
for
a
desperate
stroke
desperate
indeed
it
was
from
a
military
point
of
view
it
was
madness
he
resolved
to
hire
a
farm
in
maryland
near
to
the
great
armoury
at
harper
s
ferry
in
the
slave
state
of
virginia
and
there
diligently
and
silently
to
store
arms
then
with
a
small
company
he
would
seize
harper
s
ferry
having
possessed
mountains
where
he
hoped
there
would
be
considerable
rallying
to
his
standard
holding
his
own
amid
mountain
fastnesses
of
which
he
had
acquired
an
intimate
knowledge
he
thought
he
might
at
last
become
strong
enough
to
make
terms
with
the
government
we
next
find
him
passing
as
isaac
smith
a
maryland
farmer
known
to
his
neighbours
as
a
demure
somewhat
eccentric
son
of
the
soil
three
of
his
sons
true
to
the
vow
were
with
him
little
thought
the
farmers
around
that
hard
by
that
farmhouse
a
few
thousand
weapons
were
stored
and
that
a
little
band
of
mysterious
strangers
was
gathering
there
but
so
it
was
to
the
last
there
was
much
opposition
to
brown
s
impulsive
scheme
once
indeed
he
resigned
leadership
but
the
little
group
passed
a
horrible
five
minutes
of
bereavement
and
then
re
elected
him
with
many
promises
of
support
sublime

if
mad
indeed
he
was

he
not
made
them

they

perchance
it
will
do
more
for
the
cause
than
their
lives
would
be
worth
in
any
other
way
one
reluctant
darkie
rescued
by
him
from
slavery
was
challenged
to
say
what
he
would
do
he
hesitated
looked
at
his
shaggy
old
benefactor
and
then
with
heart
surcharged
with
gratitude
said
i
believe
i
ll
go
wid
to
hide
in
clouds
and

rain
our
low
world
from
the

train
whose
souls
filled
heroes
when
the

was
worthy
of
their
noble
birth
by
that
dull
instinct
of
the
mind

till
the
drawn

narrow
line

watery

the
arches
of
the

so
freshly
pricked
my
sharp
disgrace
i
feared
to
meet
the
human
face
skulking
as
any
woman
might
who
d
lost
her
virtue
in
the
night
and

the

come
the
distant
nations
sneers
to
tingle
in

blushing
ears
in
woe
and
ashes
as
was

we
wore
the
penitential
sheet
but
now
i
breathe
a
purer
air
and
from
the
depths
of
my
despair
awaken
to
a
cheering
morn
just
breaking
through
the
night
forlorn

me
redeem

honor
which
you
lost
with

at

came
moving

gloomy
as

as
silent

her
ports
were
closed
from

our

joked

but
feared
she
reached
our
range
could
commit
them
and
then
to
some
time
beyond
the
moment
and
here
was
the
beginning
of
his
bad
luck
as
he
grew
remiss
mr
markham
counseled
him
lectured
him
and
threatened
him
but
all
to
no
purpose
at
length
he
told
him
that
the
next
time
he
came
to
recite
without
knowing
his
lesson
he
would
correct
him
this
alarmed
william
a
good
deal
but
not
quite
enough
to
stimulate
his
industry
to
continued
exertion
and
after
ten
or
fifteen
lessons
he
came
up
deficient
again
why
have
you
not
got
this
lesson
sir
said
mr
markham
with
terrific
sir
this
was
william
s
first
falsehood
but
it
saved
him
from
a
whipping
which
he
awfully
dreaded
for
though
mr
markham
knew
that
he
had
not
told
the
truth
he
deemed
it
best
to
admit
the
excuse
at
least
so
far
as
to
withhold
the
rod
of
correction
for
the
present
as
he
dismissed
the
school
he
told
william
to
remain
a
few
moments
and
when
they
were
alone
he
thus
addressed
him
william
i
very
much
fear
you
told
me
a
falsehood
to
day
i
saw
you
all
the
morning
before
you
came
to
recite
idling
and
whispering
without
any
appearance
of
sickness
and
since
the
recitation
i
have
seen
no
sign
of
sickness
about
you
still
i
may
possibly
be
mistaken
and
i
hope
i
am
but
remember
if
ever
i
find
you
telling
a
lie
to
hide
your
faults
i
will
punish
you
more
severely
than
i
would
without
the
lie
he
then
proceeded
to
counsel
him
kindly
and
affectionately
against
the
danger
tears
for
his
conscience
gave
him
no
rest
his
mother
sought
in
vain
for
the
cause
of
his
distress
the
next
day
he
went
to
the
school
and
acquitted
himself
well
for
that
and
the
four
sncceeding
days
for
which
mr
markham
gave
him
great
credit
and
encouragement
on
the
fifth
day
he
got
permission
to
go
out
and
as
he
remained
out
an
unusually
long
time
mr
m
went
in
quest
of
him
and
found
him
in
the
act
of
concealing
his
book
among
some
rubbish
near
the
school
house
he
was
unobserved
by
william
and
he
withdrew
to
the
school
room
just
before
the
recitation
hour
william
made
his
appearance
what
he
had
been
doing
during
his
absence
was
not
known
but
that
he
had
not
been
studying
was
manifest
from
his
conduct
and
still
more
manifest
from
his
ignorance
of
the
lesson
when
he
came
to
recite
what
have
you
been
doing
william
said
mr
markham
that
you
know
nothing
of
this
lesson
nt
find
it
mr
markham
passed
the
matter
over
until
he
dismissed
his
school
when
he
detained
william
told
him
where
his
book
was
repeated
his
lecture
upon
lying
and
enforced
it
with
a
pretty
severe
flogging
william
had
never
experienced
the
like
of
that
before
and
probably
would
never
have
experienced
it
again
but
for
the
imprudence
of
his
mother
and
her
friends
he
promised
his
preceptor
that
he
would
never
repeat
his
offence
and
he
went
home
with
a
countenance
and
manner
indicative
of
a
fixed
purpose
to
keep
his
promise
he
told
his
mother
nothing
of
what
had
happened
nor
did
she
find
it
out
for
four
days
afterwards
in
the
meantime
william
was
all
that
she
or
his
preceptor
could
wish
him
to
be
it
so
happened
however
that
thomas
nokes
had
lingered
about
the
school
house
and
seen
all
that
had
transpired
between
william
and
his
teacher
he
went
home
where
he
found
mrs
glib
one
of
mrs
mitten
s
most
devoted
friends
as
she
to
affect
her
peace
mrs
g
had
stopped
on
her
way
to
her
brother
s
in
the
country
to
bid
mrs
nokes
farewell
and
had
actually
risen
to
depart
when
tom
stept
in
big
with
the
events
of
the
day
i
tell
you
what
said
he
mr
markham
give
bill
mitten
jorum
to
day
it
is
nt
possible
exclaimed
mrs
glib
that
mr
markham
has
whipt
that
dear
sweet
lovely
boy
mrs
nokes
tried
to
catch
tom
s
eye
that
she
might
stop
him
but
his
whole
attention
was
directed
to
mrs
g
and
he
went
on
yes
he
did
and
he
linked
it
into
him
like
flugins
i
ll
be
bound
he
made
the
blood
come
here
tom
caught
his
mother
s
eye
which
was
darting
lightnings
at
him
and
he
concluded
but
i
do
nt
reckon
he
hurt
him
much
though
oh
the
brute
muttered
mrs
glib
as
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
from
her
departure
she
returned
to
the
village
and
immediately
hastened
over
to
mrs
mitten
s
mrs
m
met
her
at
the
door
very
cheerfully
and
very
cordially
oh
ejaculated
mrs
glib
how
happy
i
am
to
find
you
so
cheerful
i
was
afraid
i
should
find
you
in
tears
in
tears
for
what
why
for
the
unmerciful
beating
which
mr
markham
gave
to
your
dear
sweet
lovely
little
william
last
friday
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
mrs
glib
william
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
and
not
fifteen
minutes
before
you
came
in
mr
markham
was
here
congratulating
me
on
the
progress
my
child
was
making
in
everything
that
was
good
here
mrs
g
looked
as
if
she
had
taken
an
emetic
which
was
just
about
to
operate
and
after
a
short
pause
she
proceeded
well
i
hope
it
is
a
mistake
but
it
came
to
me
from
my
children
to
mr
markham
because
i
do
nt
choose
to
have
my
children
cut
and
slashed
about
like
galley
slaves
for
every
little
childish
error
they
commit
breaking
down
their
spirit
and
teaching
them
sneaking
and
lying
and
everything
that
s
low
and
mean
mr
toper
never
whips
and
i
do
nt
see
but
that
my
children
get
along
under
him
as
well
as
other
people
s
children
here
mrs
m
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
either
to
hide
her
grief
or
a
smile
which
grief
could
not
ordher
to
give
his
misfortunate
frind
luke
clark
as
good
a
fellow
at
bottom

at
a
wake
or
exercised
his
shillelagh
and
the
privilege
of
a
citizen
at
a
primary
election
he
would
now
ask
this
honorable
company
to
hear
from
mr
clark
a
song
composed
by
thomas
whelan
esq
better
known
as
irish
tom
who
kept
a
whiskey
coffee
house
just
opposite
collector
barney
s
asylum
for

imbeciles
it
was
of

the

he
meant

and
applause
mr

mr
luke
clark
thanked
the

in
general
and
misther

in

sam
barlow
to
keep

of

when
he
got

it
was
down
on
the
knees
of
his
heart
he
was
axin

for
his
error
and
now
he
d
like
to
tell
them
who
tom
whelan
was

gev
them

was
a
mimber

it
should
not

loud
laughter
the
count
mercier
s
speech
a
war
cloud
his
watch
and
declared
that
the
supreme
the
ineffable
the
inevitable
moment
had
arrived
standing
here
in
the
midst
of
the
centuries
all
the
traditional
splendors
of
the
past
pressing
in
upon
his
mental
vision
and
with
all
the
possible
glories
of
a
french
future
for
mexico
crowding
with
supernal
presences
and
diaphoretic
radiances
in
the
foreground
of
his
unutterable
thoughts
thus
standing
but
not
insensible
to
the
material
necessities
on
which
french
valor
and
french
glory
have
their
most
enduring
base
it
became
his
duty
to
tell
them
that
the
supreme
moment
of
dinner
had
arrived
and
as
madame
the
comtesse
had
promised
bully
beef
fricaseed
frogs
and
an
oyster
stew
he
could
by
no
means
refuse
to
assist
at
the
celebration
domestique
among
the
treasured
memories
of
his
future
life
should
be
the
inconspicuous
but
not
undelighted
part
which
in
this
meeting
he
had
borne
he
would
transmit
to
the
memoire
diplomatique
his
little
joke
about
lord
palmerston
to
his
imperial
majesty
the
emperor
he
would
transmit
private
o
reilly
s
views
about
good
fellowship
of
this
interview
would
obviate
any
difficulties
between
the
government
which
he
had
the
honor
to
represent
and
that
of
which
by
many
inches
mr
lincoln
was
the
highest
coronal
he
would
shake
private
o
reilly
s
hand
france
thus
embraced
hibernia
the
gauls
and
the
celts
should
be
brothers
for
they
had
a
common
faith
a
common
enemy
here
he
glanced
towards
lord
lyons
in
this
league
of
the
latin
peoples
would
not
of
the
countess
and
bertha
a
hope
that
he
had
discovered
some
clew
and
the
latter
had
worked
herself
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
excitement
that
she
almost
anticipated
the
return
of
madeleine
in
count
tristan
s
company
her
disappointment
when
at
last
he
entered
looking
weary
and
dejected
was
proportionate
to
her
expectations
he
had
made
all
possible
search
so
he
said
and
no
information
concerning
the
fugitive
could
be
gathered
she
was
gone
he
feared
they
must
now
wait
patiently
until
they
heard
from
her
she
would
doubtless
write
soon
a
letter
might
come
at
any
moment
lady
vivian
s
offer
and
had
accepted
it
without
communicating
her
intention
because
she
feared
her
aunt
s
displeasure
this
was
the
most
likely
explanation
of
her
sudden
departure
he
had
called
at
the
chateau
de
tremazan
and
lady
vivian
had
left
for
scotland
two
days
after
the
ball
madeleine
was
doubtless
at
this
moment
on
her
way
to
edinburgh
the
count
though
he
made
this
assertion
with
an
air
of
perfect
credence
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
such
was
madeleine
s
destination
but
he
thought
to
check
persistent
inquiries
which
might
accidentally
bring
to
light
some
fine
thread
that
would
lead
to
the
discovery
of
her
retreat
oh
if
she
goes
to
lady
vivian
we
will
make
her
return
at
once
will
we
not
aunt
asked
bertha
catching
eagerly
at
this
new
hope
but
madeleine
told
me
distinctly
that
she
had
no
intention
of
accepting
lady
vivian
s
offer
there
would
be
no
harm
in
changing
her
mind
observed
done
so
therefore
give
yourself
no
more
uneasiness
at
present
bertha
would
very
gladly
have
followed
the
count
s
advice
but
even
if
she
had
made
the
effort
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
drive
anxiety
for
madeleine
out
of
her
thoughts
several
times
during
the
evening
she
started
up
thinking
that
she
heard
her
voice
if
a
step
echoed
in
the
antechamber
she
turned
eagerly
to
the
door
her
blue
eyes
greatening
with
expectation
once
when
the
roll
of
wheels
sounded
in
the
distance
she
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
rushed
out
upon
the
porch
every
moment
she
grew
more
and
more
restless
and
feverish
and
when
the
usual
hour
for
retiring
came
she
wandered
into
madeleine
s
room
instead
of
her
own
and
once
more
minutely
examined
the
whole
chamber
there
might
perhaps
be
a
note
somewhere
which
she
had
overlooked
after
the
most
diligent
search
none
was
to
be
found
there
were
pens
ink
and
paper
upon
the
little
of
writing
was
visible
the
sight
of
pen
and
ink
suggested
an
idea
which
had
not
before
occurred
to
bertha
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
maurice
she
poured
out
all
her
grief
upon
paper
and
it
was
soothed
as
if
dropped
into
words
upon
the
blank
sheet
before
her
how
often
a
full
heart
has
had
its
burden
lifted
and
lightened
at
the
pen
s
point
as
if
the
sorrow
it
recorded
grew
less
heavy
beneath
the
calming
touch
of
that
potent
instrument
chapter
ix
the
empty
place
it
chanced
that
bertha
s
letter
to
maurice
was
posted
the
next
morning
without
the
knowledge
of
count
tristan
and
his
mother
not
however
through
any
preconcerted
arrangement
on
the
part
of
bertha
her
character
was
so
frank
so
transparent
her
actions
were
always
so
unveiled
her
thoughts
flowed
in
such
an
instinctive
current
toward
her
lips
that
the
idea
of
concealment
could
have
no
spontaneous
existence
in
her
mind
she
made
no
allusion
to
the
letter
until
it
was
gone
less
fortunate
had
count
tristan
been
aware
that
such
a
letter
had
been
written
it
would
never
have
reached
its
destination
it
was
somewhat
singular
that
the
count
whose
code
of
honor
would
have
forced
him
to
resent
at
the
sword
s
point
the
faintest
hint
that
he
could
be
guilty
of
an
unworthy
action
would
not
have
scrupled
to
intercept
a
letter
to
distort
a
fact
we
use
the
mildest
phrase
to
stoop
to
any
deception
to
be
guilty
of
any
treachery
if
he
were
powerfully
prompted
by
what
he
termed
family
considerations
which
simply
meant
his
own
personal
interest
he
had
determined
to
keep
maurice
in
ignorance
of
madeleine
s
flight
as
long
as
possible
that
the
chances
of
discovering
her
retreat
might
be
diminished
and
great
was
the
wily
schemer
s
consternation
when
he
learned
that
bertha
had
unadvisedly
frustrated
his
plans
by
writing
to
her
cousin
madeleine
s
value
had
never
been
estimated
to
its
just
height
until
her
place
was
empty
it
is
not
in
human
worth
until
it
is
lacked
and
lost
alas
in
how
many
households
there
moves
with
noiseless
feet
some
placid
patient
yet
potent
spirit
with
hands
ever
ready
to
toil
or
soothe
a
smile
ever
kindled
to
comfort
or
encourage
a
voice
that
turns
common
words
to
grace
imparting
hope
and
dispensing
joy
a
presence
full
of
helpfulness
and
peace
a
being
grown
familiar
to
our
eyes
by
every
day
s
association
whom
we
carelessly
greet
or
jostle
against
unheeding
or
thrust
aside
impatiently
never
dreaming
that
our
working
day
mortal
could
she
cast
off
this
garment
of
clay
would
stand
revealed
one
of
god
s
holy
messengers
commissioned
to
minister
that
is
never
until
we
suddenly
find
her
place
empty
yet
trace
the
touch
of
her
delicate
fingers
the
print
of
her
light
footsteps
everywhere
around
us
and
feel
the
dreary
void
made
in
our
hearts
by
her
absence
and
recognize
too
late
that
we
have
entertained
an
no
one
save
count
tristan
who
did
not
make
some
such
reflection
though
vague
and
undefined
perhaps
while
thinking
of
madeleine
the
ancient
domestics
seemed
completely
lost
without
her
guiding
hand
her
spirit
of
order
systematizing
and
lightening
all
their
duties
everything
was
in
confusion
everything
went
wrong
dearly
as
they
loved
her
they
had
never
before
realized
that
mademoiselle
madeleine
had
been
of
so
much
importance
and
assistance
to
them
all
the
countess
missed
her
deck
at
eight
bells
wilton
sanborn
and
adler
were
in
the
watch
with
shuffles
and
the
malcontent
lost
not
a
moment
in
pushing
forward
the
scheme
he
had
matured
fortunately
or
unfortunately
he
was
placed
on
the
lookout
with
wilton
and
the
solitude
of
the
top
gallant
forecastle
afforded
them
a
good
opportunity
for
the
conference

gamblers
in

said
wilton
as
the
lookouts
took
their
stations

i
do

think
it
will
blow
much
it
is
only
freshening
a
little
replied
shuffles
now
what
about
the
mutiny
demanded
wilton
impatiently
after
he
had
become
more
accustomed
to
the
dash
of
the
sea
under
the
bows
of
the
ship
do
nt
call
it
by
that
name
replied
shuffles
earnestly
s
what
you
mean
is
nt
it
you
might
as
well
call
things
by
their
right
names
it
s
an
ugly
word
and
if
any
one
should
happen
to
hear
it
their
attention
would
be
attracted
at
once
we
mus
nt
get
in
the
habit
of
using
it
i
do
nt
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
yet
added
wilton
it
s
a
big
job
but
i
mean
to
put
it
through
even
if
i
am
sure
of
failure
what
s
the
use
of
doing
that
do
you
want
to
get
the
fellows
into
a
scrape
for
nothing
there
will
be
no
failure
wilton
you
may
depend
upon
that
there
will
be
a
row
on
board
within
a
day
or
two
and
if
i
mistake
not
nearly
all
the
fellows
will
be
so
mad
that
they
will
want
to
join
us
what

do
you

how

you

what

it

answered
shuffles
impatiently
for
wilton
was
much
too
inquisitive
to
suit
his
purposes
i
talked
with
the
chaplain
half
an
hour
to
night
when
he
went
to
my
berth
after
the
wine
i
rather
think
he
heard
the
rattle
of
the
props
at
any
rate
the
whole
thing
will
be
broken
up
to
morrow
or
next
day
i
do
nt
see
how
that
will
make
a
row
not
more
than
a
dozen
fellows
have
played
any
and
they
wo
nt
think
of
making
a
row
about
that
you
see
added
shuffles
confidently
ugh
exclaimed
wilton
as
a
cloud
of
spray
dashed
over
the
bow
and
drenched
the
lookout
but
they
wore
their
pea
jackets
and
such
an
occurrence
was
to
in
studding
sails
shouted
paul
kendall
who
was
the
officer
of
the
deck
and
the
order
was
repeated
by
his
subordinates
in
the
waist
and
on
the
forecastle
we
must
go
said
wilton
and
they
descended
from
their
position
the
wind
had
continued
to
freshen
until
the
ship
labored
somewhat
under
her
heavy
press
of
canvas
it
was
the
policy
of
the
principal
to
go
as
easily
and
comfortably
as
possible
and
he
had
directed
mr
fluxion
if
the
wind
continued
to
increase
to
have
the
sail
reduced
though
neither
the
safety
of
the
ship
nor
of
the
spars
absolutely
required
such
a
step
the
quarter
watch
on
deck
was
sufficient
to
perform
this
labor
lay
aloft
foretopmen
said
the
second
lieutenant
and
those
of
the
watch
who
had
their
stations
in
the
fore
rigging
sprang
up
the
shrouds
stand
by
the
halyard
of
the
top
gallant
studding
sails
man
the
tacks
and
sheets
all
ready
sir
reported
the
second
operation
lower
on
the
halyards
ease
off
the
tacks
and
haul
on
the
sheet
the
two
top
gallant
studding
sails
were
thus
brought
into
the
top
where
they
were
made
up
the
fore
topmast
and
the
lower
studding
sails
were
taken
in
by
a
similar
routine
and
the
young
america
then
moved
along
less
furiously
through
the
water
now
about
the
chain
said
wilton
when
the
lookouts
had
returned
to
their
stations
let
me
see
where
did
i
leave
off
replied
shuffles
you
said
there
was
to
be
a
row
which
i
do
nt
believe
i
may
be
mistaken
about
that
if
i
am
the
job
will
be
all
the
more
difficult
lowington
has
got
us
out
to
sea
now
and
in
my
opinion
he
means
to
shake
us
up
he
is
a
tyrant
at
heart
and
he
will
carry
it
with
a
high
hand
i
hate
the
man
added
shuffles
with
savage
earnestness
you
they
will
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
put
the
twisters
on
them
you
wo
nt
hear
him
say
if
you
please
young
gentlemen
now
that
we
are
in
blue
water
you
know
how
savage
he
was
with
me
well
but
you
were
disobedient
you
told
him
up
and
down
you
would
nt
do
what
he
ordered
you
to
do
no
matter
for
that
you
had
a
chance
to
see
the
spirit
of
the
man
he
was
a
perfect
demon
he
put
me
in
irons
exclaimed
shuffles
still
groaning
under
this
indignity
i
have
been
insulted
and
outraged
and
i
will
teach
him
that
bob
shuffles
is
not
to
be
treated
in
that
manner
i
will
be
revenged
upon
him
if
it
costs
me
my
life
the
fellows
wo
nt
go
into
any
such
desperate
game
as
that
replied
wilton
cautiously
but
there
will
be
fun
in
the
thing
added
the
malcontent
ship
all
to
ourselves
we
need
nt
trouble
ourselves
anything
about
latin
and
greek
and
trigonometry
and
algebra
we
shall
go
in
for
a
good
time
generally
it
is
all
moonshine
it
ca
nt
be
done
what
s
the
use
of
talking
about
such
a
thing
said
wilton
it
can
be
done
and
it
shall
be
replied
shuffles
stamping
his
foot
on
the
deck
how
i
am
not
quite
ready
to
tell
you
yet
very
well
i
do
nt
want
to
know
anything
more
about
it
answered
the
timid
conspirator
who
was
almost
hoped
it
would
what
about
sending
the
girls
to
mrs
fisher
s
asked
tom
when
they
were
washing
the
dishes
oh
no
no
it
wo
nt
rain
i
know
let
us
stay
mr
hallam
please
why
i
should
feel
like
a
deserter
if
i
went
off
pleaded
gypsy
the
dark
cloud
seemed
to
have
passed
away
and
the
wind
was
still
after
thinking
a
while
mr
hallam
decided
to
let
them
stay
in
the
middle
of
the
night
gypsy
was
awakened
by
a
great
noise
the
wind
was
blowing
a
miniature
hurricane
through
the
trees
and
the
rain
was
the
canvas
roof
and
drop
from
the
poles
and
gurgle
in
a
stream
through
the
ditch
she
could
hear
too
the
loud
angry
murmur
of
the
trout
brook
and
the
splashing
of
hundreds
of
rivulets
that
dashed
down
the
slope
and
over
the
gorge
into
it
she
gave
sarah
a
little
pinch
and
woke
her
up
oh
sarah
it
s
come
it
s
raining
like
everything
and
here
we
are
and
we
ca
nt
get
to
mr
fisher
s
is
nt
it
splendid
ye
es
said
sarah
it
s
very
splendid
only
is
nt
it
a
little
wet
it
s
dropping
right
on
my
cheek
oh
that
s
nothing
why
here
i
can
put
my
hand
right
down
into
a
puddle
of
water
it
s
just
like
being
at
sea
i
know
it
are
people
at
sea
always
so
cold
why
i
m
not
cold
only
we
might
as
well
wear
our
water
proofs
the
leaves
are
a
cloaks
and
gypsy
listened
to
the
wind
and
thought
it
was
very
poetic
and
romantic
and
that
she
was
perfectly
happy
and
just
as
she
had
lain
down
again
there
came
a
great
gust
of
rain
and
one
of
the
rivulets
that
were
sweeping
down
the
mountain
splashed
in
under
the
canvas
and
ran
right
through
the
middle
of
the
tent
like
a
brook
sarah
jumped
up
with
energy
o
oh
it
s
gone
right
over
my
feet
my
shoes
are
sailing
away
as
true
as
you
live
cried
gypsy
and
sprang
just
in
time
to
save
them
the
dinner
basket
and
a
tin
pail
were
fast
following
when
tom
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
called
through
the
wall
of
shawls
girls
you
ll
have
to
go
to
mrs
fisher
s
be
quick
as
you
can
i
do
nt
want
to
a
bit
said
gypsy
who
was
sitting
in
a
pool
of
water
well
i
m
going
is
very
nice
but
drowning
is
another
thing
well
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
little
dryer
said
gypsy
slowly
the
girls
were
soon
dressed
and
tom
lighted
a
lantern
and
went
with
them
a
few
peals
of
thunder
growled
sullenly
down
the
valley
and
one
bright
flash
of
lightning
glared
far
through
the
forest
sarah
was
afraid
she
should
be
struck
gypsy
was
thinking
how
grand
it
was
and
wished
she
could
be
out
in
a
midnight
storm
every
week
it
was
after
midnight
and
every
one
at
mr
fisher
s
was
asleep
but
tom
knocked
them
up
and
mr
fisher
was
very
much
amused
and
mrs
fisher
was
very
kind
and
hospitable
and
built
up
a
fire
and
said
they
should
be
perfectly
dry
and
warm
before
they
went
to
bed
so
the
girls
bade
tom
good
night
and
he
went
back
to
mr
hallam
and
they
feeling
very
cold
and
sleepy
and
drenched
were
glad
enough
to
be
taken
care
of
and
put
to
bed
like
sarah
said
gypsy
sleepily
just
as
sarah
was
beginning
to
dream
a
feather
bed
and
and
pillows
with
a
little
jump
to
keep
awake
long
enough
to
finish
her
sentence
are
a
little
better
on
the
whole
than
a
mud
pud
just
there
she
went
to
sleep
the
next
day
it
poured
from
morning
till
night
that
was
just
what
mr
hallam
and
tom
liked
so
they
fished
all
day
and
the
girls
amused
themselves
as
best
they
might
in
mr
fisher
s
barn
the
day
after
it
rained
in
snatches
and
the
sun
shone
in
little
spasms
between
a
council
of
exigencies
met
in
mr
hallam
s
tent
and
it
was
unanimously
decided
to
go
home
even
gypsy
began
to
long
for
civilized
life
though
she
declared
that
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
had
such
a
good
time
as
she
had
had
that
week
so
mr
fisher
harnessed
and
drove
them
briskly
down
the
mountain
and
from
afar
off
gypsy
saw
her
mother
s
face
glad
to
see
her
back
chapter
xi
gypsy
s
opinion
of
boston
just
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
it
was
suddenly
announced
that
miss
melville
was
not
going
to
teach
any
more
how
funny
said
gypsy
last
term
she
expected
to
just
as
much
as
anything
i
do
nt
see
what
s
the
reason
now
i
shall
have
to
go
to
the
high
school
it
chanced
that
they
were
remodelling
some
of
the
rooms
at
the
high
school
and
the
winter
term
which
would
otherwise
have
commenced
in
september
was
delayed
till
the
first
of
october
gypsy
had
jumped
on
all
the
hay
cocks
and
picked
all
the
huckleberries
and
eaten
all
the
early
davises
and
gone
on
all
the
picnics
that
she
could
and
was
just
ready
to
settle
down
contentedly
to
school
and
study
so
the
news
from
miss
melville
was
not
on
the
whole
very
agreeable
what
to
do
with
herself
for
another
long
month
of
vacation
was
more
than
she
among
the
clovers
and
swung
on
the
gate
in
a
vague
indefinite
sort
of
way
for
two
weeks
then
one
morning
mrs
breynton
read
her
a
letter
which
set
her
eyes
on
fire
with
delight
it
was
an
invitation
from
her
aunt
to
spend
a
fortnight
in
boston
it
so
happened
that
gypsy
had
never
been
to
boston
it
was
a
long
day
s
journey
from
yorkbury
and
mr
breynton
was
not
much
in
favor
of
expensive
travelling
for
the
children
while
they
were
even
now
our
shops
and
factories
is
full
uv
that
nigger
to
the
grate
detriment
uv
a
white
inhabitant
who

full
uv
him
i

then
to

very
possibly
she
would
pay

since
a
respect
for
mr

s
opinions
and

was
almost
a
part

xlv
we
left
miss
eliza
johns
in
her
chamber
swaying
back
and
news
which
the
doctor
had
communicated
what
was
to
be
done
never
had
so
serious
a
problem
been
presented
to
her
for
solution
there
were
both
worldly
and
religious
motives
as
the
spinster
reckoned
them
for
plucking
out
of
her
heart
all
the
growing
tenderness
which
she
had
begun
to
feel
toward
adle
and
the
sudden
discomfiture
of
that
engaging
ambitious
scheme
which
she
had
fondled
so
long
prompted
a
feeling
of
resentment
which
was
even
worse
than
worldly
how
would
you
have
treated
the
matter
madam
would
your
christian
charities
have
shrunk
from
the
ordeal
but
whatever
might
have
been
the
other
sins
of
the
spinster
there
was
in
her
no
disposition
to
shrink
from
the
conclusions
to
which
her
logic
of
propriety
and
respectability
might
lead
adle
was
to
be
discarded
but
not
suddenly
all
her
art
must
be
employed
to
disabuse
reuben
of
any
lingering
tenderness
the
doctor
s
old
prejudice
against
french
blood
must
be
worked
to
its
utmost
but
there
must
be
no
violent
clamor
above
all
the
false
man
must
be
instructed
that
it
would
be
agreeable
to
the
johns
family
nay
that
their
sense
of
dignity
demanded
that
he
should
reclaim
his
child
at
an
early
day
on
this
last
score
it
might
be
necessary
indeed
to
practice
very
adroit
management
with
the
doctor
but
for
the
rest
she
had
the
amplest
confidence
in
her
own
activity
and
discretion
she
was
not
the
woman
to
sleep
upon
her
plans
when
once
they
were
decided
on
and
she
had
no
sooner
forecast
her
programme
than
she
took
advantage
of
the
lingering
twilight
to
arrange
her
toilet
for
a
call
upon
the
elderkins
of
course
she
led
off
the
doctor
in
her
trail
the
spinster
s
marching
orders
as
he
jocularly
termed
them
the
good
man
was
as
incapable
of
resisting
as
if
he
had
been
twenty
years
a
husband
in
a
few
swift
words
she
unfolded
her
design
and
now
benjamin
do
nt
pray
let
your
sentiment
get
the
better
think
of
the
proprieties
in
the
case
benjamin
the
proprieties
which
she
enforced
by
a
little
shake
of
her
forefinger
whenever
it
came
to
a
question
of
the
proprieties
the
doctor
was
conscious
of
his
weakness
what
indeed
could
the
poor
man
know
about
the
proprieties
as
set
forth
by
miss
johns
that
he
should
presume
to
argue
against
them
what
indeed
can
any
man
do
when
a
woman
bases
herself
on
the
proprieties
it
was
summer
weather
and
the
windows
of
the
hospitable
elderkin
mansion
were
wide
open
as
the
doctor
and
spinster
drew
near
little
gusts
of
cheery
music
came
out
to
greet
their
ears
for
at
this
time
miss
almira
had
her
rival
pianos
about
the
village
and
the
pretty
rose
had
been
taught
a
deft
way
of
touching
the
first
class
instrument
which
the
kind
hearted
squire
had
bestowed
upon
her
and
if
it
must
be
told
little
sparkling
waltzes
had
from
time
to
elderkin
had
winked
at
little
furtive
parlor
dances
on
the
part
of
rose
and
adle
they
had
so
charmed
the
old
squire
and
set
all
his
blood
as
he
said
with
a
gallant
kiss
upon
the
brow
of
mrs
elderkin
flowing
in
the
old
school
boy
currents
now
it
happened
upon
this
very
evening
that
the
squire
though
past
seventy
now
was
in
the
humor
to
see
a
good
old
fashioned
frolic
and
rose
rattling
off
some
crazy
waltz
phil
at
a
hint
from
the
old
gentleman
had
taken
possession
of
adle
and
was
showing
off
with
a
good
deal
of
grace
and
more
spirit
the
dancing
steps
of
which
he
had
had
experience
with
the
spanish
seoritas
dame
tourtelot
who
chanced
to
be
present
wore
a
long
face
which
it
is
conceivable
the
hearty
old
squire
enjoyed
as
much
as
the
dancing
but
mrs
elderkin
must
have
looked
with
a
warm
maternal
pride
upon
the
fine
athletic
figure
of
her
boy
as
he
went
twirling
down
the
floor
very
midst
of
it
however
the
doctor
and
miss
johns
came
like
a
cloud
the
fingers
of
rose
rested
idly
on
the
keys
adle
who
was
gay
beyond
her
wont
alone
of
all
the
company
could
not
give
over
her
light
heartedness
on
the
instant
so
she
makes
away
to
greet
the
doctor
miss
johns
standing
horrified
new
papa
you
have
surprised
us
phil
was
showing
me
some
new
steps
do
you
think
it
very
very
wrong
adaly
adaly
ah
you
dear
old
man
it
is
nt
wrong
say
it
is
nt
wrong
by
this
time
the
squire
has
come
forward
ah
doctor
young
folks
will
be
young
folks
but
i
think
you
wo
nt
have
a
quarrel
with
mrs
elderkin
yonder
my
dear
addressing
mrs
elderkin
you
must
set
this
matter
right
with
the
doctor
we
must
keep
our
young
people
in
his
good
books
the
good
said
the
parson
reuben
who
had
been
loitering
about
rose
and
who
to
do
him
justice
had
seen
phil
s
gallant
attention
to
adle
without
one
spark
of
jealousy
was
specially
interested
in
this
interruption
of
the
festivities
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
was
most
eager
to
know
how
far
the
evening
s
hilarity
would
be
imputed
as
a
sin
to
the
new
convert
and
how
far
religious
severities
if
she
met
any
would
control
the
ardor
of
adle
the
doctor
s
face
softened
even
while
he
talked
with
the
charming

chapter
xxxiii
husband
and
wife
it
may
readily
be
guessed
that
such
extraordinary
developments
as
those
revealed
in
the
preceding
chapters
produced
more
than
a
superficial
impression
upon
a
quiet
community
like
that
of
kennett
and
the
adjoining
townships
people
secluded
from
the
active
movements
of
the
world
are
drawn
to
take
the
greater
interest
in
their
own
little
family
histories
a
feeling
which
by
and
by
amounts
to
a
partial
sense
of
ownership
justifying
not
only
any
degree
of
advice
or
comment
but
sometimes
even
actual
interference
the
quakers
who
formed
a
majority
of
the
population
and
generally
controlled
public
sentiment
in
domestic
matters
through
the
purity
of
their
own
domestic
life
at
once
pronounced
in
favor
of
mary
barton
the
fact
of
her
having
taken
an
oath
was
a
slight
stumbling
block
to
some
but
her
patience
her
fortitude
her
submission
to
what
she
felt
to
be
the
divine
will
and
the
solemn
were
qualities
which
none
could
better
appreciate
the
fresh
warm
sympathies
of
the
younger
people
already
given
to
gilbert
and
martha
now
also
embraced
her
far
and
wide
went
the
wonderful
story
carrying
with
it
a
wave
of
pity
and
respect
for
her
of
contempt
and
denunciation
for
her
husband
the
old
friends
and
their
wives
came
to
visit
her
in
their
stately
chairs
almost
daily
for
a
week
or
two
the
quiet
of
the
farm
was
invaded
either
by
them
or
by
the
few
friends
who
had
not
forsaken
her
in
her
long
disgrace
and
were
doubly
welcome
now
she
received
them
all
with
the
same
grave
simple
dignity
of
manner
gratefully
accepting
their
expressions
of
sympathy
and
quietly
turning
aside
the
inconsiderate
questions
that
would
have
probed
too
deeply
and
painfully
to
an
aged
friend
a
preacher
of
the
sect
who
plumply
asked
her
what
course
she
intended
to
pursue
towards
her
husband
she
replied
i
will
not
trouble
my
do
will
be
made
manifest
when
the
occasion
comes
this
reply
was
so
entirely
in
the
quaker
spirit
that
the
old
man
was
silenced
dr
deane
who
was
present
looked
upon
her
with
admiration
whatever
conjectures
alfred
barton
might
have
made
in
advance
of
the
consequences
which
would
follow
the
disclosure
of
his
secret
marriage
they
could
have
borne
no
resemblance
to
the
reality
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
imagine
the
changes
which
the
years
had
produced
in
his
wife
he
looked
forward
to
wealth
to
importance
in
the
community
and
probably
supposed
that
she
would
only
be
too
glad
to
share
the
proud
position
with
him
there
would
be
a
little
embarrassment
at
first
of
course
but
his
money
would
soon
make
everything
smooth
now
he
was
utterly
defeated
crushed
overwhelmed
the
public
judgment
so
much
the
more
terrible
where
there
is
no
escape
from
it
rolled
down
upon
him
avoided
or
coldly
ignored
by
the
staid
respectable
farmers
openly
insulted
by
his
at
and
tortured
by
the
poor
and
idle
hangers
on
of
the
community
who
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
thus
repaying
him
for
his
former
haughtiness
and
their
own
humility
he
found
himself
a
moral
outcast
his
situation
became
intolerable
he
no
longer
dared
to
show
himself
in
the
village
or
upon
the
highways
but
slunk
about
the
house
and
farm
cursing
himself
his
father
and
the
miserable
luck
of
his
life
when
finally
giles
begged
to
know
how
soon
his
legacy
would
be
paid
and
hinted
that
he
could
nt
stay
any
longer
than
to
get
possession
of
the
money
for
hard
as
it
might
be
to
leave
an
old
home
he
must
stop
going
to
the
mill
or
getting
the
horses
shod
or
sitting
in
the
unicorn
bar
room
of
a
saturday
night
and
a
man
might
as
well
be
in
jail
at
once
and
be
done
with
it
when
alfred
barton
heard
all
this
he
deliberated
for
a
few
minutes
whether
it
would
not
be
a
or
beg
for
mercy
no
other
course
was
left
that
evening
he
stole
up
to
the
village
fearful
at
every
step
of
being
seen
and
recognized
and
knocked
timidly
at
dr
deane
s
door
martha
and
her
father
were
sitting
together
when
he
came
into
the
room
and
they
were
equally
startled
at
his
appearance
his
large
frame
seemed
to
have
fallen
in
his
head
was
bent
and
his
bushy
whiskers
had
become
quite
gray
deep
wrinkles
seamed
his
face
his
eyes
were
hollow
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drooped
with
an
expression
of
intolerable
misery
i
wanted
to
say
a
word
to
miss
martha
if
she
ll
let
me
he
said
looking
from
one
to
the
other
i
allowed
thee
to
speak
to
my
daughter
once
too
often
dr
deane
sternly
replied
what
thee
has
to
say
now
must
be
said
in
my
presence
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
this
he
said
that
i
must
have
a
little
mercy
or
lay
hands
on
my
own
life
i
have
nt
a
word
to
say
for
myself
i
deserve
it
all
i
ll
do
anything
that
s
wanted
of
me
whatever
mary
says
or
people
think
is
her
right
that
she
has
nt
yet
got
if
it
s
mine
to
give
you
said
you
wished
me
well
miss
martha
even
at
the
time
i
acted
so
shamefully
i
remember
that
and
so
i
ask
you
to
help
me
she
saw
that
he
spoke
truth
at
last
and
all
her
contempt
and
disgust
could
not
keep
down
the
quick
sensation
of
pity
which
his
wretchedness
inspired
but
she
was
unprepared
for
his
appeal
and
uncertain
how
to
answer
it
what
would
you
have
me
do
she
asked
go
to
mary
on
my
behalf
ask
her
to
pardon
me
if
she
can
or
say
what
i
can
do
to
earn
they
wo
nt
be
so
hard
on
me
if
they
know
she
s
done
that
everything
depends
on
her
and
leave
you
sir
well
that
is
strange
then
why
do
you
business
question
i
m
going
sir
i
m
going
sir
to
be
married
and
she
burst
into
tears
i
congratulated
myself
on
being
a
bachelor
if
conjugal
affection
produced
such
an
effect
oh
that
s
it
said
i
dryly
well
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
but
you
ve
been
so
kind
sir
you
there
now
stop
i
have
only
tried
to
be
just
said
i
looking
exultingly
at
my
smiling
sister
who
took
off
a
little
gold
stud
and
gave
it
to
her
with
many
wishes
of
a
happy
life
everything
went
on
regularly
as
everything
in
its
place
when
the
bell
rang
during
dear
mary
s
sway
it
continued
to
ring
and
on
one
occasion
a
friend
met
me
in
the
street
and
said
why
william
have
you
moved
i
replied
no
that
we
were
very
comfortable
where
we
were
why
do
you
ask
that
s
very
strange
said
he
we
called
yesterday
at
one
o
clock
and
rang
for
twenty
minutes
no
one
coming
we
concluded
you
had
left
for
europe
no
i
said
feeling
rather
confused
the
waiter
i
believe
is
subject
to
sciatica
at
times
he
is
taken
suddenly
and
can
not
move
and
the
reason
we
did
not
hear
the
bell
i
looked
away
as
i
said
so
his
cries
of
pain
are
such
that
you
can
not
hear
yourself
speak
now
the
door
is
answered
before
the
first
ring
stops
sounding
for
i
arranged
it
so
as
to
vibrate
long
enough
to
give
a
in
exactly
two
minutes
and
no
man
of
the
world
rings
oftener
than
once
every
three
minutes
i
would
not
have
written
all
this
but
my
blessed
sister
soon
entirely
followed
out
my
reformation
and
is
fairly
convinced
as
she
says
that
when
a
man
sets
about
any
matter
he
is
very
thorough
clear
headed
and
above
all
not
easily
put
down
oh
if
all
women
thought
so
eh
mr
caudle
i
knew
one
learned
gentleman
who
only
desired
peace
and
good
food
his
wife
never
allowed
him
to
offer
a
suggestion
she
called
him
a
genius
and
made
him
mind
formerly
mary
rose
thoughtful
with
the
pressure
of
business
on
her
brain
at
meals
she
was
abstracted
often
worried
and
at
all
times
the
repository
of
domestic
troubles
her
healthy
organization
was
altogether
too
mesmerized
by
the
petty
warfare
below
stairs
she
was
never
idle
and
yet
rarely
accomplished
anything
for
herself
her
position
in
the
household
might
have
been
called
that
of
grand
in
vain
finally
she
would
bring
it
into
the
library
and
stitch
stitch
all
through
the
pleasant
evenings
i
knew
this
for
i
laid
a
plan
one
april
i
asked
her
to
work
me
a
pair
of
slippers
on
cloth
i
presume
a
clever
woman
undisturbed
could
have
delivered
them
over
to
me
at
the
end
of
the
week
now
no
one
is
more
clever
than
my
sister
yet
i
did
not
get
those
slippers
till
december
and
then
she
handed
them
to
me
in
sadness
and
said
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
dear
william
i
worked
one
myself
but
my
duties
are
such
that
i
gave
out
the
other
to
that
poor
woman
whose
husband
is
at
sea
has
nt
she
done
it
well
now
i
find
her
reading
paying
visits
and
often
of
an
evening
she
comes
to
me
and
says
william
would
nt
you
like
some
new
handkerchiefs
embroidered
or
ca
nt
i
mend
anything
for
you
i
have
just
finished
my
occasion
while
she
was
mending
not
making
reader
but
mending
her
children
s
clothes
i
offered
to
read
one
of
ik
marvel
s
reveries
of
a
bachelor
a
special
favorite
of
mine
she
thanked
me
and
i
proceeded
on
finishing
one
of
his
admirable
paragraphs
i
put
the
book
down
and
exclaimed
is
nt
that
capital
she
said
at
once
no
i
think
it
is
very
discouraging
discouraging
why
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
mary
excuse
me
william
but
i
was
nt
listening
the
fact
of
it
is
there
has
been
another
row
down
stairs
and
i
do
think
that
girl
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
to
treat
susan
so
and
then
for
one
hour
a
topographical
and
analytical
history
of
the
entire
household
was
gone
into
with
a
con
amore
spirit
which
lasted
through
two
segars
and
a
glass
of
water
i
never
spoke
on
these
occasions
they
do
nt
want
you
to
talk
confiding
manner
you
know
i
have
no
one
to
sympathize
with
me
and
off
they
go
like
the
recitation
of
pope
s
homer
made
by
some
school
girl
who
has
been
sentenced
to
run
through
so
many
lines
i
slipped
the
reveries
into
their
place
so
that
she
would
not
be
hurt
and
i
do
assure
you
that
when
she
had
got
through
i
believe
if
you
had
asked
her
suddenly
who
discovered
america
she
would
have
replied
an
irishman
i
forget
his
name
formerly
there
was
ever
a
business
gravity
about
her
now
she
always
appeared
with
a
sweet
smile
that
lit
up
her
countenance
as
though
it
had
been
sprinkled
all
over
with
sun
powder
difficult
indeed
was
it
for
mary
to
order
anything
without
an
advance
notice
for
otherwise
she
was
forced
to
start
her
little
bark
through
the
scylla
and
charybdis
of
fire
island
namely
the
fire
s
too
low
marm
or
i
ve
just
put
on
coal
marm
the
prettiest
passages
in
tennyson
which
no
woman
could
find
out
if
her
understanding
had
been
mortgaged
by
servants
before
no
matter
what
dish
of
meat
was
set
before
me
it
was
always
dry
or
the
gravy
made
of
butter
and
water
i
have
often
seen
mutton
chops
come
on
table
looking
like
little
islands
of
meat
surrounded
by
water
on
which
might
be
detected
a
tickley
benders
of
grease
five
minutes
conversation
on
my
part
supplied
the
deficiency
and
caused
one
can
of
lard
to
outlast
do
nt
you
eat
your
luncheon
sir
said
jennie
vance
for
the
man
after
taking
up
the
slices
of
bread
and
looking
at
them
had
put
them
down
again
with
an
air
of
disdain
i
thought
by
the
looks
of
the
house
that
christians
lived
here
said
he
shaking
his
head
slowly
have
nt
you
a
piece
of
apple
pie
or
a
cup
custard
to
give
a
poor
man
that
s
been
in
prison
for
you
in
the
south
country
not
so
much
as
a
cup
of
coffee
or
a
slice
of
beefsteak
no
i
see
how
it
is
he
added
wiping
his
face
and
rising
with
an
effort
you
are
selfish
good
for
nothing
creeters
the
whole
of
you
here
i
ve
been
wasting
my
time
and
all
i
get
for
it
is
just
dog
s
victuals
and
enough
scrip
to
light
off
puffing
dotty
longed
to
run
after
him
and
call
out
please
sir
give
me
back
my
money
but
it
was
too
late
and
summoning
all
her
pride
she
managed
to
crush
down
the
tears
tell
the
people
in
this
house
that
i
shake
off
the
dust
of
my
feet
against
them
wheezed
the
stranger
indignantly
the
dust
of
my
feet
do
you
hear
what
a
wicked
disagreeable
old
thing
murmured
jennie
vance

grandmamma

o

a
hidden

what
aunt
ria

said
prudy
speaking
for
her
she
gave
it
all
to
the
beggar
yes
she
did
one
two
free
four
nineteen
tenteen
said
katie
and
the
gemplum
did
nt
love
little
goorls
why
alice
to
that
man
who
was
here
yesterday
dotty
was
frowning
at
prudy
behind
a
chair
yes
m
she
answered
in
a
stifled
voice
were
you
sorry
for
him
no
ma
am
did
you
hear
me
say
i
did
not
believe
he
was
in
need
of
charity
yes
m
grandma
looked
puzzled
till
she
remembered
that
alice
had
always
been
fond
of
praise
and
then
she
began
to
understand
her
motives
did
you
suppose
jennie
vance
and
your
sisters
would
think
you
were
generous
asked
she
but
made
no
reply
because
if
that
was
your
reason
alice
it
was
doing
your
alms
before
men
to
be
seen
of
them
god
is
not
pleased
when
you
do
so
i
told
you
about
that
the
other
day
still
the
little
girl
did
not
understand
her
thoughts
were
like
these
grandma
thinks
i
m
ever
so
silly
prudy
thinks
i
m
silly
but
is
nt
jennie
silly
too
and
o
she
takes
cake
all
secret
out
of
her
new
mother
s
tin
chest
i
do
nt
know
what
will
become
of
jennie
vance
mrs
parlin
was
about
to
say
more
when
miss
flyaway
who
had
been
all
over
the
house
in
two
minutes
danced
in
saying
the
charlie
boy
had
come
it
was
little
lisping
charlie
gray
saying
if
you
pleathe
m
may
we
have
the
deacon
to
go
to
mill
and
then
if
we
may
can
you
cauthe
if
you
ca
nt
then
you
muth
nt
deacon
was
the
old
horse
and
as
mr
parlin
was
quite
willing
he
should
go
to
mill
harry
gray
came
an
hour
afterwards
and
led
him
away
with
regard
to
the
other
request
mrs
parlin
had
to
think
a
few
minutes
yes
charlie
said
she
at
last
you
may
have
the
milk
because
i
would
like
to
oblige
your
mother
and
you
may
tell
her
i
will
send
it
every
night
by
the
children
now
mrs
gray
was
the
doctor
s
wife
she
was
a
kind
woman
and
kept
one
closet
shelf
full
of
canned
fruit
and
jellies
for
sick
people
but
for
all
that
the
children
did
not
like
her
very
well
prudy
thought
it
might
be
because
her
nose
turned
up
like
the
nose
of
a
tea
kettle
but
susy
said
it
was
because
she
asked
so
many
questions
if
the
little
parlins
met
her
on
the
street
when
they
inquire
what
they
had
been
buying
at
the
store
or
took
their
parcels
out
of
their
hands
and
felt
them
with
her
fingers
she
was
interested
in
very
little
things
and
knew
how
all
the
parlors
in
town
were
papered
and
carpeted
and
what
sort
of
cooking
stoves
everybody
used
dotty
hung
her
head
when
her
grandmother
said
she
wished
her
to
go
every
night
to
mrs
gray
s
with
a
quart
of
milk
must
i
said
she
why
grandma
she
ll
ask
me
if
my
mother
keeps
a
girl
and
how
many
teaspoons
we
ve
got
in
the
house
she
will
honestly
may
nt
somebody
go
with
me
ask
me
will
i
go
said
katie
for
i
love
to
shake
my
head
and
grandma
added
dotty
mrs
gray
s
eyes
are
utter
a
prayer
over
the
dead
body
there
were
those
who
said
that
all
this
indicated
a
partial
species
of
insanity
that
jackson
s
mind
was
not
sound
other
stories
are
told
of
him
which
aim
to
show
that
his
eccentricities
amounted
to
craziness
upon
this
point
the
philosophers
and
physiologists
must
decide
the
present
writer
can
only
say
that
jackson
appeared
to
him
to
be
an
eminently
rational
judicious
and
sensible
person
in
conversation
and
the
world
must
determine
whether
there
was
any
craze
any
flaw
or
crack
or
error
in
the
terribly
logical
processes
of
his
brain
as
a
fighter
of
armies
the
old
incredulity
of
frederick
will
obtrude
itself
upon
the
mind
if
not
bite
somebody
and
inoculate
them
with
a
small
amount
of
his
insanity
as
a
soldier
unquestionably
the
most
striking
trait
of
jackson
as
a
leader
was
his
unerring
judgment
and
accuracy
of
calculation
the
present
writer
believes
himself
to
be
familiar
with
every
detail
of
his
career
and
does
not
recall
one
blunder
kernstown
was
fought
upon
information
furnished
by
general
ashby
a
most
accomplished
and
reliable
partisan
which
turned
out
to
be
inaccurate
but
even
in
defeat
jackson
there
accomplished
the
very
important
object
of
retaining
a
large
federal
force
in
the
valley
which
mcclellan
needed
on
the
chickahominy
for
instances
of
the
boldness
fertility
and
originality
of
his
conceptions
take
the
campaigns
against
general
pope
the
surprise
of
harper
s
ferry
the
great
flank
attack
at
chancellorsville
and
the
marvellous
success
of
every
step
taken
in
the
campaign
of
the
valley
this
is
not
the
occasion
for
an
analysis
of
these
campaigns
but
it
may
be
safely
declared
that
they
are
magnificent
illustrations
of
the
mathematics
of
war
that
splendid
must
have
possessed
a
sanity
for
all
practical
purposes
difficult
to
dispute
iv
jackson
s
religious
opinions
are
unknown
to
the
present
writer
he
has
been
called
a
fatalist
all
sensible
men
are
fatalists
in
one
sense
in
possessing
a
strong
conviction
that
what
will
be
will
be
but
men
of
deep
piety
like
jackson
are
not
oriental
in
their
views
fate
was
a
mere
word
with
jackson
with
no
meaning
his
star
was
providence
love
for
and
trust
in
that
providence
dwelt
and
beat
in
every
vein
and
pulse
of
his
nature
his
whole
soul
was
absorbed
in
his
religion
as
much
as
a
merchant
s
is
in
his
business
or
a
statesman
s
in
public
affairs
he
believed
that
life
meant
intensely
and
meant
good
to
find
its
meaning
was
his
meat
and
drink
his
religion
was
his
life
and
the
real
world
a
mere
phantasmagoria
he
seemed
to
have
died
rejoicing
preferring
death
to
stern
practical
mathematical
calculator
of
chances
the
obstinate
unyielding
fighter
the
most
prosaic
of
realists
in
all
the
commonplaces
of
the
dreadfully
commonplace
trade
of
war
the
world
knocks
down
many
people
with
that
cry
of
eccentric
by
which
is
really
meant
insane
any
divergence
from
the
conventional
is
an
evidence
of
mental
unsoundness
jackson
was
seen
once
in
lexington
walking
up
and
down
in
a
heavy
rain
before
the
superintendent
s
quarters
waiting
for
the
clock
to
strike
ten
before
he
delivered
his
report
he
wore
woollen
clothes
throughout
the
summer
he
would
never
mail
a
letter
which
to
reach
its
destination
must
travel
on
sunday
all
these
things
made
him
laughed
at
and
yet
the
good
sense
seems
all
on
his
side
the
folly
on
that
of
the
laughers
the
institute
was
a
military
school
military
obedience
was
the
great
important
lesson
to
the
student
rigid
unquestioning
obedience
jackson
set
them
the
example
he
was
ordered
to
hand
in
his
report
at
present
it
before
ten
in
consequence
of
the
rain
he
was
ordered
to
don
a
woollen
uniform
in
the
winter
and
having
received
no
order
preseribing
or
permitting
another
continued
to
wear
it
he
considered
it
wrong
to
travel
or
carry
mails
on
sunday
and
would
not
take
part
in
the
commission
of
wrong
this
appears
logical
however
eccentric
in
truth
the
great
soldier
was
an
altogether
earnest
man
with
little
genius
for
the
trivial
pursuits
of
life
or
its
more
trivial
processes
of
thought
and
opinion
his
temper
was
matter
of
fact
his
logic
straightforward
nonsense
could
not
live
in
his
presence
the
lighter
graces
were
denied
him
but
not
the
abiding
charm
he
had
no
eye
for
the
flower
of
the
peas
no
palate
for
the
bubble
on
the
champagne
of
life
but
he
was
true
kind
brave
and
simple
life
with
him
was
a
hard
earnest
struggle
duty
seems
to
have
been
his
watchword
it
is
hard
to
find
true
and
honest
jackson
has
probably
excited
more
admiration
in
europe
than
any
other
personage
in
the
late
revolution
his
opponents
even
are
said
to
have
acknowledged
the
purity
of
his
motives
to
have
recognised
the
greatness
of
his
character
and
the
splendor
of
his
achievements
this
sentiment
springs
naturally
from
a
review
of
his
life
it
is
no
part
of
my
design
to
present
a
critical
analysis
of
his
military
movements
this
must
sooner
or
later
be
done
but
at
present
the
atmosphere
is
not
clear
of
the
battle
smoke
and
figures
are
seen
indistinctly
the
time
will
come
when
the
campaigns
of
jackson
will
become
the
study
of
military
men
in
the
old
world
and
the
new
the
masterly
advances
and
retreats
of
the
valley
the
descent
against
mcclellan
the
expedition
to
pope
s
rear
which
terminated
in
the
second
battle
of
manassas
and
the
great
flank
movement
at
chancellorsville
which
has
made
the
tangled
brakes
of
the
spotsylvania
wilderness
famous
for
ever
under
the
grave
exterior
the
reserved
demeanour
the
old
of
human
nature
will
discern
one
of
the
immortals
in
the
man
who
holds
aloft
his
hand
in
prayer
while
his
veteran
battalions
move
by
steadily
to
the
charge
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
fancy
a
reproduction
of
the
stubborn
cromwell
sternest
of
ironsides
going
forth
to
conquer
in
the
name
of
the
i
give
him
the
note
becoz
he
furnished
the
paper
and
it
made
him
easy
in
his
mind
i
put
down
the
memorandum
bekoz
it
looked
business
like
benevolence
is
a
prominent
trait
in
my
karacter
when
givin
my
note

do
a

i
never
begrudge
the
trouble
uv
writin
it

wat

to
show
that

there
bein

as

rarely

we

possessing

wants

weaknesses
like
sympathies
and
yearnings
with
ourselves
anything
will
do
for
them
under
any
external
circumstances
is
their
duty
to
be
satisfied
i
was
wrong
in
this
matter
nothing
was
now
clearer
to
me
than
this
but
how
was
i
to
get
right
that
was
the
puzzling
question
i
thought
and
thought
looking
at
the
difficulty
first
on
this
side
and
then
on
that
no
way
of
escape
presented
itself
except
through
some
open
or
implied
acknowledgment
of
wrong
that
is
i
must
have
some
plain
kind
talk
her
by
an
entire
change
of
manner
that
i
was
conscious
of
having
spoken
to
her
in
a
way
that
was
not
met
by
my
own
self
approval
pride
was
not
slow
in
vindicating
her
own
position
among
the
mental
powers
she
was
not
willing
to
see
me
humble
myself
to
a
servant
polly
had
given
notice
that
she
was
going
to
leave
and
if
i
made
concession
she
would
at
once
conclude
that
i
did
so
meanly
from
self
interest
because
i
wished
to
retain
her
services
my
naturally
independent
spirit
revolted
under
this
view
of
the
case
but
i
marshalled
some
of
the
better
forces
of
my
mind
and
took
the
field
bravely
on
the
side
of
right
and
duty
for
some
time
the
conflict
went
on
then
the
better
elements
of
my
nature
gained
the
victory
when
the
decision
was
made
i
sent
a
message
for
polly
i
saw
as
she
entered
my
room
that
her
cheeks
no
longer
burned
and
that
the
fire
had
died
out
in
her
sad
but
enduring
polly
said
i
kindly
sit
down
i
would
like
to
have
some
talk
with
you
the
girl
seemed
taken
by
surprise
her
face
warmed
a
little
and
her
eyes
which
had
been
turned
aside
from
mine
looked
at
me
with
a
glance
of
inquiry
there
polly
and
i
pointed
to
a
chair
sit
down
she
obeyed
but
with
a
weary
patient
air
like
one
whose
feelings
were
painfully
oppressed
polly
said
i
with
kindness
and
interest
in
my
voice
has
anything
troubled
you
of
late
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
reddened
if
there
has
polly
and
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
speak
to
me
as
a
friend
you
can
trust
me
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
sudden
and
strong
emotion
that
instantly
manifested
itself
her
face
fell
into
her
hands
and
she
sobbed
out
with
a
violence
that
startled
then
said
laying
a
hand
kindly
upon
her
as
i
spoke
polly
you
can
talk
to
me
as
freely
as
if
i
were
your
mother
speak
plainly
and
if
i
can
advise
you
or
aid
you
in
any
way
be
sure
that
i
will
do
it
i
do
nt
think
you
can
help
me
any
ma
am
unless
it
is
to
bear
my
trouble
more
patiently
she
answered
in
a
subdued
way
trouble
child
what
trouble
has
anything
gone
wrong
with
you
the
manner
in
which
this
inquiry
was
made
aroused
her
and
she
said
quickly
and
with
feeling
wrong
with
me
o
no
ma
am
but
you
are
in
trouble
polly
not
for
myself
ma
am
not
for
myself
was
her
earnest
reply
for
whom
then
polly
the
girl
did
not
answer
for
some
moments
then
with
a
long
deep
sigh
she
said
you
never
saw
such
a
nice
boy
and
i
was
so
fond
of
him
he
had
a
hard
place
where
he
worked
and
they
paid
him
so
little
that
poor
fellow
if
i
had
nt
spent
half
my
wages
on
him
he
d
never
have
looked
fit
to
be
seen
among
folks
when
he
was
eighteen
he
seemed
to
me
perfect
he
was
so
good
and
kind
but
and
the
girl
s
voice
almost
broke
down
somehow
he
began
to
change
after
that
i
think
he
fell
into
bad
company
oh
ma
am
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
have
killed
me
the
first
time
i
found
that
he
had
been
drinking
and
was
not
himself
i
cried
all
night
for
two
or
three
nights
when
we
met
again
i
tried
to
talk
with
tom
about
it
but
he
would
nt
hear
a
word
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
got
angry
with
his
sister
it
has
been
going
on
from
bad
to
worse
ever
since
he
s
several
years
younger
than
you
are
polly
yes
ma
am
he
was
only
ten
years
old
when
our
mother
died
i
am
glad
she
is
dead
now
what
i
ve
never
said
before
there
were
only
two
of
us
tom
and
i
and
i
being
nearly
six
years
the
oldest
felt
like
a
mother
as
well
as
a
sister
to
him
i
ve
never
spent
much
on
myself
as
you
know
and
never
had
as
good
clothes
as
other
girls
with
my
wages
it
took
nearly
everything
for
tom
oh
dear
what
is
to
come
of
it
all
it
will
kill
me
i
m
afraid
a
few
questions
on
my
part
brought
out
particulars
in
regard
to
polly
s
brother
that
satisfy
me
of
his
great
lapse
from
virtue
and
sobriety
he
was
now
past
twenty
and
from
all
i
could
learn
was
moving
swift
footed
along
the
road
to
destruction
there
followed
a
dead
silence
for
some
time
after
all
the
story
was
told
what
it
seemed
that
i
could
offer
neither
advice
nor
consolation
but
it
was
in
my
power
to
show
interest
in
the
girl
and
to
let
her
feel
that
she
had
my
sympathy
she
was
sitting
with
her
eyes
cast
down
and
a
look
of
sorrow
on
her
pale
thin
face
i
had
not
before
re
marked
the
signs
of
emaciation
that
touched
me
deeply
polly
said
i
with
as
much
kindness
of
tone
as
i
could
express
it
is
the
lot
of
all
to
have
trouble
and
each
heart
knows
its
own
bitterness
but
on
some
the
trouble
better
fer
that
flint
coiled
up
his
long
limbs
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
chewed
meditatively
for
a
moment
and
then
began

his
slowest

just
as

abaout

own
sarsy

er
servin
on
me
an
car
line
jest
up
an
and
went
away
i
did
not
feel
quite
so
impassive
as
he
said
i
looked
what
are
you
going
to
wear
to
night
daisy
mrs
sandford
asked
presently
i
do
nt
know
ma
am
dear
have
you
agreed
to
give
your
cousin
half
the
evening
no
ma
am
i
could
not
i
am
engaged
for
every
dance
and
more
more
said
mrs
sandford
yes
ma
am
for
the
next
time
preston
has
reason
she
said
laughing
but
i
think
daisy
grant
will
be
the
most
jealous
of
all
do
him
good
what
will
become
of
his
sciences
and
his
microscope
now
why
i
shall
be
just
as
ready
for
them
i
said
mrs
sandford
shook
her
head
you
will
find
the
hops
will
take
more
than
that
she
said
but
now
daisy
think
what
you
will
wear
for
we
must
go
soon
and
get
ready
i
did
not
want
to
think
about
it
i
expected
of
course
to
put
on
the
same
dress
i
had
worn
the
last
time
but
mrs
sandford
objected
very
strongly
she
said
not
if
you
can
help
it
i
could
not
imagine
why
not
it
is
quite
nice
enough
i
urged
it
is
scarcely
the
least
mussed
in
the
world
people
will
think
you
have
not
another
my
dear
what
matter
would
that
be
i
said
wholly
puzzled
now
my
dear
daisy
said
mrs
sandford
half
laughing
you
are
the
veriest
daisy
in
the
world
and
do
not
understand
the
world
that
you
grow
in
no
matter
just
oblige
me
and
put
on
something
else
to
night
what
have
you
got
i
had
other
dresses
like
the
rejected
one
i
had
another
still
white
like
them
but
of
different
make
and
quality
i
hardly
knew
what
it
was
for
i
had
never
worn
it
to
please
mrs
sandford
i
took
it
out
now
she
was
pleased
it
was
like
the
rest
out
of
the
store
of
beautiful
texture
made
and
trimmed
as
my
mother
and
a
parisian
artist
could
manage
between
them
but
no
parisian
artist
could
know
better
than
my
mother
how
a
thing
should
be
that
will
do
said
mrs
sandford
approvingly
dear
me
what
lace
what
lace
you
southern
ladies
do
wear
to
be
sure
a
blue
sash
now
daisy
no
ma
am
i
think
not
rose
it
must
be
blue
or
rose
but
i
thought
differently
and
kept
it
white
no
colour
said
mrs
sandford
none
at
all
then
just
let
me
put
this
little
bit
of
green
in
your
hair
as
i
stood
before
the
glass
and
she
tried
various
positions
for
some
geranium
leaves
i
felt
that
would
not
do
either
any
dressing
of
my
head
would
commonise
the
whole
thing
i
watched
her
fingers
and
the
geranium
leaves
going
from
one
side
of
my
head
to
the
other
watched
how
every
that
i
could
not
suffer
it
and
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
i
who
a
little
while
before
had
not
cared
about
my
dress
for
the
evening
now
did
care
and
that
determinedly
i
knew
i
would
wear
no
geranium
leaves
not
even
to
please
mrs
sandford
and
for
the
first
time
a
question
stole
into
my
mind
what
was
i
daisy
doing
but
then
i
said
to
myself
that
the
dress
without
this
head
adorning
was
perfect
in
its
elegance
it
suited
me
and
it
was
not
wrong
to
like
beauty
nor
to
dislike
things
in
bad
taste
perhaps
i
was
too
handsomely
dressed
but
i
could
not
change
that
now
another
time
i
would
go
back
to
my
embroidered
muslins
and
stay
there
i
like
it
better
without
anything
mrs
sandford
i
said
removing
her
green
decorations
and
turning
away
from
the
glass
mrs
sandford
sighed
but
said
it
would
do
without
them
and
away
we
went
feel
the
omnibus
roll
with
me
over
the
plain
that
still
sultry
night
all
those
nights
were
sultry
then
as
we
came
near
the
academic
building
i
could
see
the
lights
in
the
upper
windows
here
and
there
an
officer
sitting
in
a
window
sill
and
the
figures
of
cadets
passing
back
and
forth
then
we
mounted
to
the
hall
above
filled
with
cadets
in
a
little
crowd
and
words
of
recognition
came
and
preston
meeting
us
almost
before
we
got
out
of
the
dressing
room
daisy
you
dance
with
me
i
am
engaged
preston
for
the
first
dance
already
the
second
then
and
all
the
others
i
am
engaged
i
repeated
and
left
him
for
mr
thorold
was
at
my
side
i
forgot
preston
the
next
minute
it
was
easy
to
forget
him
for
all
the
first
half
of
the
evening
i
was
honestly
happy
in
dancing
in
talking
too
whenever
thorold
was
they
went
over
the
platitudes
of
the
day
or
they
started
subjects
of
interest
that
were
not
interesting
to
me
bits
of
gossip
discussions
of
fashionable
amusements
with
which
i
could
have
nothing
to
do
frivolous
badinage
which
was
of
all
things
most
distasteful
to
me
yet
amid
it
all
i
believe
there
was
a
subtle
incense
of
admiration
which
by
degrees
and
insensibly
found
its
way
to
my
senses
but
i
had
two
dances
with
thorold
and
at
those
times
i
was
myself
and
enjoyed
unalloyed
pleasure
and
so
i
thought
did
he
i
saw
preston
when
now
and
then
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
looking
excessively
glum
midway
in
the
evening
it
happened
that
i
was
standing
beside
him
for
a
few
moments
waiting
for
my
next
partner
you
are
dancing
with
nobody
but
that
man
whom
i
hate
he
grumbled
who
is
it
now
captain
vaux
will
you
dance
with
me
after
that
i
banks
you
seem
to
like
it
pretty
well
he
growled
no
wonder
said
mrs
sandford
you
were
quite
right
about
the
geranium
leaves
daisy
you
do
not
want
them
you
do
not
want
anything
my
dear
she
whispered
at
this
instant
a
fresh
party
entered
the
room
just
as
my
partner
came
up
to
baltimore
writes
me
i
believe
in
good
faith
that
nolan
has
two
widowed
sisters
residing
in
that
neighborhood
a
correspondent
of
the
philadelphia
despatch
believed
the
article
untrue
as
the
united
states
corvette
levant
was
lost
at
sea
nearly
three
years
since
between
san
francisco
and
san
juan
i
may
remark
that
this
uncertainty
as
to
the
place
of
her
loss
rather
adds
to
the
probability
of
her
turning
up
after
three
years
in
lat
deg
s
long
deg
w
a
writer
in
the
new
orleans
picayune
in
a
careful
historical
paper
explained
at
length
that
i
had
been
mistaken
all
through
that
philip
nolan
never
went
to
sea
but
to
texas
that
there
he
was
shot
in
battle
march
and
by
orders
from
spain
every
fifth
man
of
his
party
was
to
be
shot
had
they
not
died
in
prison
fortunately
however
he
left
his
papers
and
of
the
picayune
s
correspondent
this
friend
proposes
to
publish
them
and
the
public
will
then
have
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
true
history
of
philip
nolan
the
man
without
a
country
with
all
these
continuations
however
i
have
nothing
to
do
i
can
only
repeat
that
my
philip
nolan
is
pure
fiction
i
can
not
send
his
scrap
book
to
my
friend
who
asks
for
it
because
i
have
it
not
to
send
i
remembered
when
i
was
collecting
material
for
my
story
that
in
general
wilkinson
s
galimatias
which
he
calls
his
memoirs
is
frequent
reference
to
a
jorkins
like
partner
of
his
of
the
name
of
nolan
who
at
some
time
near
the
beginning
of
this
century
was
killed
in
texas
whenever
wilkinson
found
himself
in
rather
a
deeper
bog
than
usual
he
used
to
justify
himself
by
saying
that
he
could
not
explain
such
or
such
a
charge
because
the
papers
referring
to
it
were
lost
when
mr
nolan
was
imprisoned
in
legends
of
a
mythical
time
i
took
the
liberty
to
give
him
a
brother
rather
more
mythical
whose
adventures
should
be
on
the
seas
i
had
the
impression
that
wilkinson
s
friend
was
named
stephen
and
as
such
he
is
spoken
of
in
this
story
at
page
but
long
after
this
was
printed
i
found
that
the
new
orleans
paper
was
right
in
saying
that
the
texan
hero
was
named
philip
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
changed
him
inadvertently
to
stephen
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
change
him
back
again
i
remember
to
have
heard
a
distinguished
divine
preach
on
st
philip
s
day
by
accident
a
discourse
on
the
life
of
the
evangelist
stephen
if
such
a
mistake
can
happen
in
the
best
regulated
of
pulpits
i
must
be
pardoned
for
mistaking
philip
for
stephen
nolan
the
reader
must
observe
that
he
was
dead
some
years
before
the
action
of
this
story
begins
in
the
same
connection
i
must
add
that
mr
p
nolan
the
teamster
in
boston
an
indulgent
public
is
no
relation
of
the
hero
of
this
tale
if
any
reader
considers
the
invention
of
a
brother
too
great
a
liberty
to
take
in
fiction
i
venture
to
remind
him
that
t
is
sixty
years
since
and
that
i
should
have
the
highest
authority
in
literature
even
for
much
greater
liberties
taken
with
annals
so
far
removed
from
our
time
a
boston
paper
in
noticing
the
story
of
my
double
contained
in
another
part
of
this
collection
said
it
was
highly
improbable
i
have
always
agreed
with
that
critic
i
confess
i
have
the
same
opinion
of
the
story
of
philip
nolan
it
passes
on
ships
which
had
no
existence
is
vouched
for
by
officers
who
never
lived
its
hero
is
in
two
or
three
places
at
the
same
time
under
a
process
wholly
impossible
under
any
conceivable
administration
of
affairs
in
reply
therefore
to
a
kind
adviser
in
connecticut
who
told
me
that
the
story
must
be
apologized
for
because
it
was
continued
cruelty
of
the
federal
government
through
a
half
century
i
must
be
permitted
to
say
that
the
public
being
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
may
be
supposed
to
know
something
i
suppose
that
very
few
casual
readers
of
the
new
york
herald
of
august
th
observed
in
an
obscure
corner
among
the
deaths
the
announcement
nolan
died
on
board
u
s
corvette
levant
lat
deg
s
long
deg
w
on
the
th
of
may
philip
nolan
i
happened
to
observe
it
because
i
was
stranded
at
the
old
mission
house
in
mackinaw
waiting
for
a
lake
superior
steamer
which
did
not
choose
to
come
and
i
was
devouring
to
the
very
stubble
all
the
current
literature
i
could
get
hold
of
even
down
to
the
deaths
and
marriages
in
the
herald
my
memory
for
names
and
people
is
good
and
the
reader
will
see
as
he
goes
on
that
i
had
reason
enough
to
would
have
paused
at
that
announcement
if
the
officer
of
the
levant
who
reported
it
had
chosen
to
make
it
thus
died
may
th
the
man
without
a
country
for
it
was
as
the
man
without
a
country
that
poor
philip
nolan
had
generally
been
known
by
the
officers
who
had
him
in
charge
during
some
fifty
years
as
indeed
by
all
the
men
who
sailed
under
them
i
dare
say
there
is
many
a
man
who
has
taken
wine
with
him
once
a
fortnight
in
a
three
years
cruise
who
never
knew
that
his
name
was
nolan
or
whether
the
poor
wretch
had
any
name
at
all
there
can
now
be
no
possible
harm
in
telling
this
poor
creature
s
story
reason
enough
there
has
been
till
now
ever
since
madison
s
administration
went
out
in
for
very
strict
secrecy
the
secrecy
of
honor
itself
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
navy
who
have
had
nolan
in
successive
charge
and
certainly
it
speaks
and
the
personal
honor
of
its
members
that
to
the
press
this
man
s
story
has
been
wholly
unknown
and
i
think
to
the
country
at
us
directly
into
the
arms
of
our
companions
ah
our
companions
would
to
heaven
we
were
with
them
again
sighed
isaline
courage
dear
one
courage
and
we
may
be
with
them
sooner
than
you
believe
if
they
in
turn
have
met
with
no
disaster
and
have
not
passed
the
ford
said
isaline
and
even
if
they
have
there
will
cheerily
the
river
has
only
been
temporarily
raised
by
the
storm
of
yesterday
and
i
can
see
that
the
waters
are
now
rapidly
subsiding
to
their
regular
depth
by
the
time
we
reach
the
ford
we
shall
undoubtedly
find
the
stream
in
a
condition
to
cross
and
how
far
do
you
suppose
we
are
from
the
ford
now
henry
i
do
not
know
but
not
far
not
more
than
three
or
four
miles
at
most
judging
from
what
that
white
savage
told
us
oh
if
kind
heaven
will
only
permit
us
to
rejoin
our
companions
said
isaline
with
tremulous
anxiety
after
soothing
and
reassuring
her
with
many
kind
words
tenderly
spoken
henry
whose
passion
for
drawing
the
grand
sublime
or
beautiful
in
nature
would
not
let
him
rest
idly
in
so
enchanting
a
place
at
length
said
will
you
pardon
me
dear
isaline
if
while
you
are
resting
i
attempt
to
sketch
the
beauties
oh
yes
by
all
means
returned
the
other
so
that
we
do
not
make
too
long
a
delay
here
the
next
minute
the
young
artist
was
engaged
in
his
favorite
pastime
and
soon
became
so
deeply
absorbed
that
all
else
was
forgotten
danger
isaline
everything
minutes
flew
by
unheeded
an
hour
or
two
passed
away
and
his
mind
was
still
as
intent
as
ever
upon
the
work
before
him
he
standing
on
the
rock
and
isaline
seated
at
his
feet
suddenly
he
was
startled
by
a
hand
clutching
him
convulsively
i
hear
voices
said
isaline
in
a
low
frightened
tone
henry
looked
up
and
around
and
i
see
indians
he
rejoined
leaping
down
from
the
rock
and
fairly
dragging
isaline
into
the
bushes
chapter

whispered
henry
to
his
trembling
companion
as
he
reached
out
and
drew
his
rifle
from
the
old
tree
against
which
it
yet
do
not
be
too
much
alarmed
for
i
am
almost
certain
i
was
not
discovered
and
if
so
we
are
as
safe
here
as
if
a
mile
away
remain
perfectly
quiet
here
dear
isaline
and
let
me
creep
forward
and
reconnoitre
oh
henry
you
will
not
leave
me
i
must
go
with
you
follow
me
then
but
so
cautiously
as
not
to
snap
the
smallest
twig
for
these
savages
have
very
sharp
ears
and
i
tremble
to
think
what
would
be
your
doom
should
anything
occur
to
betray
our
presence
here
we
have
said
the
island
was
thickly
covered
with
trees
and
bushes
but
the
whole
space
was
small
and
from
the
spot
where
henry
first
discovered
the
indians
to
the
point
where
he
could
look
out
through
a
close
covert
upon
the
open
grove
of
the
main
land
was
only
a
few
yards
though
so
great
was
his
caution
that
he
was
comparatively
a
long
time
in
reaching
it
when
which
not
only
made
him
shudder
but
awakened
the
most
strange
and
conflicting
emotions
for
there
on
the
very
spot
where
he
had
stopped
with
his
fair
companion
to
gaze
around
upon
the
beauties
of
the
place
stood
six
hideously
painted
savages
and
three
white
men
one
of
the
latter
being
no
other
than
his
long
lost
foe
charles
hampton
the
second
methoto
and
the
third
the
villain
who
had
attempted
to
decoy
himself
and
companions
ashore
on
the
ohio
a
thousand
thoughts
rushed
whirling
through
his
brain
in
a
moment
hampton
then
was
not
dead
but
had
managed
to
join
the
indians
and
perhaps
had
incited
them
to
follow
the
train
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
opportunity
of
attacking
it
at
advantage
and
of
carrying
out
his
own
wicked
purpose
of
obtaining
revenge
and
getting
possession
of
isaline
it
was
natural
to
conjecture
that
they
had
observed
where
two
horses
had
turned
off
from
the
main
body
the
day
before
and
that
a
part
of
them
at
least
had
followed
that
trail
and
companion
from
immediate
capture
it
was
unnecessary
to
imagine
what
movements
had
been
made
subsequently
since
it
was
clear
enough
that
this
party
had
got
upon
their
trail
after
the
loss
of
the
horses
and
that
nothing
but
the
darkness
had
again
saved
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
at
daylight
of
the
present
morning
it
was
probable
these
savages
had
again
discovered
their
trail
and
rapidly
pursued
it
to
methoto
s
cabin
where
the
white
indian
conversing
with
them
in
their
own
language
had
undoubtedly
given
them
all
the
information
in
his
possession
and
had
then
willingly
joined
them
in
the
pursuit
so
much
for
the
past
but
what
of
the
future
it
was
terrible
to
contemplate
henry
saw
that
he
and
isaline
were
already
cut
off
from
their
companions
whom
they
had
so
fondly
hoped
to
join
soon
and
what
chance
of
escape
had
they
now
the
thought
of
their
present
condition
made
him
shudder
and
yet
he
felt
grateful
to
that
kind
providence
which
had
so
wonderfully
preserved
them
thus
far
and
perhaps
be
saved
from
the
capture
that
would
have
ensued
had
they
continued
their
flight
all
these
thoughts
went
through
the
brain
of
henry
almost
at
a
flash
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
terrible
group
before
him
for
some
cause
the
whole
party
had
halted
upon
the
very
spot
where
he
and
isaline
had
stopped
scarcely
two
hours
before
but
evidently
not
like
him
to
admire
the
surrounding
beauties
the
indians
were
speaking
together
in
the
thick
guttural
tones
of
their
native
tongue
and
gesticulating
rapidly
almost
fiercely
and
the
white
men
were
standing
a
little
apart
and
looking
at
them
two
of
them
evidently
listening
understandingly
and
hampton
noting
the
debate
or
dispute
with
the
interest
of
one
concerned
in
not
thought
best
for
her
to
fatigue
herself
that
day
by
selling
rags
and
the
wheelbarrow
enterprise
was
rang
the
door
bell
was
mrs
vance
s
girl
susan
who
called
for
jennie
to
go
home
and
try
on
a
frock
jennie
did
not
return
and
dotty
had
a
sense
of
uneasiness
all
day
the
guilty
secret
of
the
three
dollars
weighed
upon
her
mind
should
she
or
should
she
not
tell
her
grandmother
i
do
nt
know
but
jennie
would
do
something
to
my
things
if
i
told
thought
she
but
then
i
never
promised
a
word
here
it
is
four
o
clock
who
knows
but
she
s
gone
and
spent
that
money
and
my
grandmother
never
ll
know
what
s
come
of
it
this
possibility
was
very
alarming
jennie
vance
does
nt
seem
to
have
any
little
whisper
inside
of
her
heart
that
ticks
like
a
watch
but
i
have
my
conscience
pricks
so
i
know
that
perhaps
it
s
my
duty
to
go
and
tell
dotty
drew
herself
up
virtuously
and
looked
in
the
glass
there
she
seemed
to
see
an
just
right
a
little
girl
as
much
purer
than
jennie
vance
as
a
lily
is
purer
than
a
very
ugly
toadstool
well
miss
dotty
there
is
some
truth
in
the
picture
jennie
is
not
a
good
child
but
neither
are
you
an
angel
there
is
more
wickedness
in
your
proud
little
heart
than
you
will
ever
begin
to
find
out
and
wait
a
minute
who
teaches
you
all
you
know
of
right
and
wrong
is
it
your
mother
suppose
she
had
died
as
did
jennie
s
mamma
when
you
were
a
toddling
baby
there
that
s
all
you
do
not
hear
a
word
i
say
and
if
you
did
you
would
not
heed
o
self
righteous
dotty
dimple
dotty
ran
up
stairs
to
find
her
grandmother
grandma
whispered
she
though
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
something
dreadful
has
happened
you
ve
lost
three
dollars
what
dear
o
you
need
nt
look
in
your
and
tried
to
make
me
take
half
but
of
course
i
never
and
now
she
s
run
off
with
em
found
three
dollars
in
the
rag
bag
i
guess
not
yes
grandma
for
i
saw
her
just
as
she
was
going
to
find
em
in
a
pair
of
pockets
i
should
have
seen
em
myself
if
she
had
nt
looked
first
indeed
is
this
really
so
but
she
ought
to
have
come
and
given
them
to
me
that
was
just
what
i
told
her
over
and
over
grandma
and
over
again
but
she
s
a
dreadful
naughty
girl
jennie
vance
is
if
there
s
anything
bad
she
can
do
she
goes
right
off
and
does
it
hush
my
child
yes
m
i
wo
nt
say
any
more
only
i
do
nt
think
my
mother
would
like
to
have
me
play
with
little
girls
that
take
money
out
of
rag
bags
dotty
jennie
said
she
was
going
to
buy
you
a
silk
dress
and
so
forth
but
she
does
truly
lie
so
one
to
another
that
you
ca
nt
believe
her
for
certain
not
half
she
says
grandma
looked
over
her
spectacles
and
through
the
window
as
if
trying
to
see
what
ought
to
be
done
illustration
you
ca
n
t
believe
her
for
certain
you
did
right
to
tell
me
this
my
child
said
she
but
i
wish
you
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
any
one
else
will
you
remember
yes
m
replied
dotty
trying
to
read
her
grandmother
s
face
and
feeling
a
little
alarmed
by
its
solemnity
what
you
going
to
do
grandma
not
put
jennie
in
the
lockup
are
you
cause
if
you
do
o
do
nt
you
she
said
t
was
her
sharp
eyes
and
she
did
nt
mean
to
steal
and
twas
nt
your
pockets
and
she
grandma
go
dear
and
bring
me
my
bonnet
from
the
band
box
in
my
bed
room
closet
then
mrs
parlin
folded
the
sheet
she
was
making
put
on
her
best
shawl
and
bonnet
and
kid
gloves
and
taking
her
sun
umbrella
set
out
for
a
walk
there
was
a
look
in
her
face
which
made
her
little
granddaughter
think
it
would
not
be
proper
to
ask
any
questions
mrs
parlin
met
jennie
vance
coming
in
at
the
gate
o
dear
thought
dotty
i
do
nt
want
to
see
her
grandma
says
i
ve
done
right
but
jennie
ll
call
me
a
tell
tale
i
ll
go
out
in
the
barn
and
hide
the
guilty
secret
had
lain
heavy
at
jennie
s
heart
all
day
as
soon
as
her
dress
maker
could
spare
her
and
a
troublesome
little
cousin
had
left
she
asked
permission
to
go
to
mrs
parlin
s
dotty
thinks
i
meant
to
keep
it
she
thought
i
never
the
least
little
thing
but
she
takes
it
sober
earnest
and
says
she
ll
tell
her
grandmother
jennie
stole
round
by
the
back
door
and
timidly
asked
for
miss
dimple
i
m
sure
i
do
nt
know
where
she
is
answered
ruthie
with
a
pleasant
smile
nor
flyaway
either
i
have
been
living
in
peace
for
half
an
hour
ruthie
made
you
think
of
lemon
candy
she
was
sweet
and
tart
too
while
jennie
with
the
kind
assistance
of
prudy
was
hunting
for
dotty
mrs
parlin
was
in
judge
vance
s
parlor
talking
with
jennie
s
step
mother
mrs
vance
was
shocked
to
hear
of
her
daughter
s
conduct
for
she
loved
her
and
wished
her
to
do
right
my
poor
jennie
said
she
from
her
little
babyhood
until
she
was
six
years
old
there
was
no
one
to
take
care
of
her
but
a
hired
nurse
who
neglected
her
sadly
i
know
just
what
sort
of
training
jennie
it
was
most
unfortunate
but
you
are
so
faithful
with
her
my
dear
mrs
vance
that
i
do
believe
she
will
outgrow
all
those
early
influences
i
keep
hoping
so
said
mrs
vance
repressing
a
sigh
i
take
it
so
near
me
that
i
fancied
i
was
seen
but
i
hid
me
for
a
moment
neath
a
bush
of
liberal
bloom
then
fled
onward
to
my
entrance
through
the
streets
that
intervene
above
an
imminent
meteor
flashed
westward
gainst
the
night
and
trailed
with
ruby
shine
it
seemed
a
blazing
torch
to
me
borne
onward
with
the
flight
of
a
spirit
that
beneath
it
brought
defeat
to
constantine
vii
the
battle
to
the
town
outspoke
the
cannon
ere
the
dawn
charged
on
the
night
not
of
peace
and
joy
and
amity
but
of
hatred
and
despair
and
a
thousand
blatant
bugles
proved
it
waiting
for
their
spite
and
we
heard
the
rasp
of
bullets
in
the
dark
astonished
air
when
the
sun
rose
hot
and
bloody
all
the
fight
had
well
begun
the
artillery
were
pounding
at
the
weak
place
in
the
wall
while
the
smoke
from
vale
and
city
seemed
the
melancholy
dun
robes
of
spirits
hovering
over
for
the
fated
ones
to
fall
like
a
strong
numidian
lion
on
her
rock
the
city
lay
nothing
daunted
though
surrounded
and
with
scanty
store
of
bread
her
fierce
eyes
two
flags
of
crimson
stared
through
battle
all
the
day
one
on
babel
wad
s
these
gates
they
set
their
sworders
hoping
thence
to
drive
us
back
when
we
followed
up
their
sallies
which
were
baits
to
make
us
come
but
in
vain
our
works
were
safer
though
we
longed
for
the
attack
and
eagerly
awaited
for
the
summons
of
the
drum
stone
by
stone
a
breach
was
opened
in
the
thin
place
in
the
wall
till
at
last
we
sent
a
truce
flag
to
the
gate
of
babel
djed
saying
to
the
town
surrender
constantine
must
surely
fall
if
you
fail
no
soul
remaining
shall
be
left
to
count
your
dead
like
a
sword
thrust
was
the
answer
there
is
plenty
in
the
place
both
of
food
and
ammunition
if
t
is
these
the
french
desire
we
can
furnish
them
abundance
but
surrender
means
disgrace
and
our
homes
shall
be
defended
while
one
soldier
stands
to
fire
should
not
this
town
be
captured
every
man
must
bear
the
fault
and
many
a
one
bethought
him
of
his
own
in
we
must
take
it
by
assault
and
we
heard
the
bugles
playing
for
the
stormers
to
advance
like
great
billows
never
breaking
were
the
rocks
of
constantine
and
a
cargoed
ship
the
city
with
its
keel
in
every
one
she
was
sailing
for
the
future
with
the
barter
of
the
line
and
her
mast
like
towers
were
gaudy
with
the
pennons
of
the
sun
but
now
a
storm
had
struck
her
and
a
hole
was
in
her
side
and
the
waters
rushed
in
wildly
while
she
paused
upon
the
brink
all
in
vain
each
brave
endeavor
for
all
on
board
her
tried
to
close
the
leak
with
fury
that
the
vessel
might
not
sink
our
men
the
angry
waters
that
could
not
be
turned
nor
checked
and
they
bore
all
straws
before
them
in
their
mad
impetuous
way
so
the
town
betrayed
was
captured
so
the
great
ship
had
been
wrecked
and
with
the
troops
in
triumph
i
rode
in
upon
that
day
viii
the
wedding
and
the
false
all
the
lights
were
lit
again
in
the
hall
of
silken
standards
and
of
persia
woven
mats
there
were
women
fair
as
houris
there
were
brave
and
handsome
men
and
the
fish
leaped
up
to
see
them
from
the
fountain
s
silver
vats
never
yet
so
fair
eudocia
and
she
won
the
wisest
praise
from
the
aliens
there
assembled
to
behold
our
marriage
rite
not
alone
her
queenly
beauty
but
the
grace
of
all
her
ways
drew
all
hearts
and
eyes
toward
her
filled
like
cups
with
pure
delight
but
while
yet
they
said
the
service
and
ere
yet
i
placed
the
ring
on
her
tapering
heart
finger
all
the
crowd
was
parted
wide
and
i
saw
my
friend
the
masker
his
unasked
for
presence
bring
to
the
pollen
of
the
wedding
lady
petaled
on
each
side
thus
shall
die
the
thankless
traitor
whether
king
or
beggar
he
and
a
dagger
gleamed
above
us
with
a
fierce
glare
at
the
light
then
was
struck
upon
my
bosom
near
the
place
the
heart
might
be
hastened
wildly
in
his
flight
but
the
mad
bee
gained
no
honey
in
his
hurry
to
depart
his
sting
had
been
well
pointed
but
his
villainy
was
loss
for
i
wore
with
faith
a
secret
o
er
the
throbbing
of
my
heart
the
symbol
of
a
higher
life
a
simple
silver
cross
this
had
turned
aside
the
weapon
and
spared
me
many
years
for
one
whose
heart
has
been
to
me
a
holy
pilgrim
shrine
for
one
for
whom
i
gave
away
with
bitterness
and
tears
the
city
of
jugurtha
my
own
mother
constantine
we
dwell
now
in
a
palace
near
the
white
surge
of
a
bay
but
at
times
my
good
steed
wanders
and
in
the
twilight
late
i
find
me
near
my
city
while
the
muezzin
in
the
gray
shouts
to
prayer
to
prayer
ye
people
only
god
is
good
and
great
the
strong
spider
i
the
chief
s
daughter
i
was
a
naturalist
and
had
crossed
the
sea
and
come
to
had
heard
the
people
of
the
town
wagged
doubting
heads
when
asked
about
it
but
one
day
i
met
a
sturdy
fisherman
who
once
had
seen
the
spider
though
he
knew
not
his
abode
he
said
the
spider
was
as
long
as
he
and
that
the
woof
whereof
he
wove
his
web
was
thick
as
any
cordage
on
his
boat
at
night
belated
mid
the
tumuli
that
mound
the
hill
side
and
the
vernal
vale
like
the
raised
letters
of
an
ancient
page
made
for
the
blind
gropers
of
to
day
to
read
he
entered
a
dark
tomb
and
therein
slept
until
the
world
like
some
round
shield
upraised
splintered
the
thrown
spears
of
dawn
as
he
woke
he
found
himself
ensnared
in
provoking
linda
o
you
re
so
quick
so
clever
all
you
men
and
women
are
so
dull
and
credulous
so
easily
duped
when
left
to
go
alone
what
you
would
prove
is
that
my
daring
step
in
being
first
to
make
a
declaration
was
needless
since
priority
in
love
same
result
about
without
my
seeking
know
then
the
money
was
not
yours
until
i
d
got
the
news
of
my
recovered
fortune
from
me
the
money
came
and
only
me
and
all
that
story
of
a
judd
turned
deacon
grown
penitent
and
making
restitution
was
a
mere
myth
invented
by
your
father
lest
you
might
hesitate
to
take
the
money
now
if
i
had
not
sought
you
as
i
did
and
if
i
had
not
put
you
to
the
test
and
if
i
had
not
learnt
your
secret
grief
we
might
have
lived
till
we
were
gray
and
bent
before
a
step
of
yours
had
brought
us
nearer
outflanked
i
own
it
and
i
give
it
up
cried
charles
all
flushing
with
astonishment
but
how
i
ll
rate
that
ancient
fisherman
my
graceless
father
for
deceiving
me
see
him
stand
there
as
if
with
conscience
void
throwing
the
line
for
innocent
fat
trout
with
that
grave
face
saying
i
ll
deacon
him
what
you
regret
it
do
you
master
charles
the
crooked
ways
that
brought
you
where
you
are
you
would
make
straight
and
have
the
past
undone
to
think
that
by
a
woman
you
ve
been
wooed
to
think
that
by
a
woman
you
ve
been
won
is
thought
too
humbling
and
too
scandalous
is
an
indignity
too
hard
to
bear
oh
well
sir
well
do
as
you
please
the
child
goes
with
its
mother
though
remember
that
and

those
who

also
feel
that

too
there
is
no
opening

for
this
they
are
trained
to
feel
that
it
is
disgraceful
to
seek
they
have
nothing
to
do

wait
to
be
sought
trained
to
believe

their
highest
boon
they
are
disgraced
for
seeking
it
and
must
affect
indifference
meantime
to
do
anything
to
earn
their
own
independence
is
what

themselves

their

as
disgraceful

then
if
cast
down
by

they

to
nothing
that
would
earn

if
by

they
have

no

sanctify
the
most
absurd
notions
says
j
a
st
john
have
prevailed
on
the
subject
of
matrimony
marriage
it
is
said
is
a
divine
institution
therefore
marriages
are
made
in
heaven
but
the
consequence
does
not
at
all
follow
the
meaning
of
the
former
proposition
simply
being
that
god
originally
ordained
that
men
and
women
should
be
united
in
wedlock
but
that
he
determined
what
particular
men
and
women
should
be
united
every
day
s
experience
proves
to
be
false
it
is
admitted
on
all
hands
that
marriage
is
intended
to
confer
happiness
on
those
who
wed
now
if
it
be
found
that
marriage
does
not
confer
happiness
on
them
it
is
an
undoubted
proof
that
they
ought
not
to
have
been
united
and
that
the
sooner
they
separate
the
better
but
from
accepting
this
doctrine
some
persons
are
deterred
by
misrepresentations
of
scripture
by
an
entire
indifference
to
human
happiness
they
regard
men
and
women
as
mere
animals
and
provided
they
have
children
and
rear
them
nothing
more
it
is
incredible

submission

yielding

unnatural

false
all
know
is
hideously
wrong
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
i
was
amazed
to
see
that
among
the
mormon
women
there
are
some
few
persons
of
education
of
positive
cultivation
as
a
class
the
mormons
are
not
an
educated
people
but
they
are
by
no
means
the
community
of
ignoramuses
so
many
writers
have
told
us
they
were
the
valley
in
which
they
live
is
splendidly
favoured
they
raise
immense
crops
lead
and
silver
mines
all
they
eat
all
they
drink
all
they
wear
they
can
produce
themselves
and
still
have
a
great
abundance
to
sell
to
the
gold
regions
of
idaho
on
the
one
hand

the
silver
regions
of

the
president
of
this
remarkable
community
the
head
of
the
mormon
church
is
brigham
young
he
is
called
president
young
and
brother
brigham
he
is
about
years
old
altho
he
does
nt
look
to
be
over
he
has
sandy
hair
and
whiskers
is
of
medium
height
and
is
a
little
inclined
to
corpulency
he
was
born
in
the
state
of
vermont
his
power
is
more
absolute
than
that
of
any
living
sovereign
yet
he
uses
it
with
such
consummate
discretion
that
his
people
are
almost
madly
devoted
to
him
and
that
they
would
cheerfully
die
for
him
if
they
thought
the
sacrifice
were
demanded
i
can
not
doubt
he
is
a
man
of
enormous
wealth
onetenth
of
everything
and
mr
brigham
young
is
the
church
it
is
supposed
that
he
speculates
with
these
funds
at
all
events
he
is
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
now
living
worth
several
millions
without
doubt
he
is
a
bold
bad
man
but
that
he
is
also
a
man
of
extraordinary
administrative
ability
no
one
can
doubt
who
has
watched
his
astounding
career
for
the
past
ten

only
fair
for
me
to
add
that

at

sold

sent

i
was
quite
young
during

vacation
i
used
to
teach
a
school
of
whales
and
there

i
learned
to
spout
i
do
nt
expect
applause
for
a

thing
like
that
i
wish
you
could
he
s
dead
now

has
gone
from
us
but
if
old

could
have
heard
that
effort
it
would
have
given
him

tell

it
was

are
stationed
in

two
regiments
of
u

troops
the
st
from
california
and
the
th
from
nevada
the
onesters
asked
me
to
present
a
stand
of
colours
to
the
sters
and
i
did
it
in
a
speech
so
abounding
in
eloquence
of
a
bold
and
brilliant
character
and
also
some
sweet
talk
real
pretty
shop
keeping
talk
that
i
worked
the
enthusiasm
of
those
soldiers
up
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
came
very
near
shooting
me
on
the
spot
brigham
young
s
harem
these
are
the
houses
of
brigham
demanding
the
ban
cherem
i
once
thought
all
that
part
of
scripture
which
referred
to
the
casting
out
of
devils
was
metaphorical
but
i
know
better
now
for
the
one
that
luther
assaulted
with
his
inkstand
was
not
more
palpable
than
that
which
enters
into
my
heart
every
now
and
then
and
overturns
the
altars
of
the
true
good
and
beautiful
and
sets
up
instead
a
small
hall
as
that
hideous
last
judgment
of
orcagna
in
the
campo
santo
at
pisa
which
you
once
showed
me
in
a
portfolio
of
engravings
oh
dr
grey
you
ought
to
be
merciful
to
me
for
indeed
god
gave
me
a
fearfully
wicked
and
cunning
spirit
for
a
perpetual
companion
and
tempter
even
christ
had
lucifer
and
quarantina
yes
and
conquered
both
and
promised
assistance
to
all
who
earnestly
desire
and
resolve
to
follow
his
example
you
can
not
forgive
my
rudeness
the
act
of
incivility
was
very
slight
but
my
young
friend
the
unaccountable
perversity
of
your
character
certainly
fills
my
mind
with
serious
apprehension
concerning
your
future
of
course
i
can
very
readily
forgive
the
occasion
that
displayed
it
but
i
can
not
entirely
forget
the
spirit
that
distresses
me
when
i
least
expect
it
if
you
will
dismiss
this
afternoon
from
your
mind
i
will
never
stop
make
me
no
more
promises
till
you
are
strong
enough
i
am
not
angry
but
i
am
disappointed
she
drooped
her
head
to
avoid
his
grave
sad
gaze
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
dr

you
shake
hands
with
me
in

of
pardon

xiii
ulpian
have
you
had
any
conversation
with
salome
upon
what
subject
have
you
talked
with
her
concerning
her
studies
not
recently
soon
after
muriel
and
miss
dexter
came
glad
to
see
her
enter
a
class
with
muriel
and
pursue
the
same
studies
and
that
such
an
arrangement
would
be
entirely
agreeable
to
miss
dexter
but
she
declined
the
proposition
saying
she
would
only
trouble
the
latter
to
teach
her
italian
do
you
know
why
she
is
so
anxious
to
acquire
that
language
no
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
know
less
and
less
every
day
about
her
actions
for
the
child
has
suddenly
grown
very
reserved
this
morning
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
library
with
her
hands
behind
her
and
her
eyes
looking
as
if
they
were
travelling
to
jericho
or
jeddo
and
when
i
asked
her
why
she
was
so
unusually
silent
she
snapped
like
a
toy
torpedo
i
am
silent
because
this
is
one
of
my
wicked
days
and
i
am
fighting
the
devil
and
if
i
open
my
lips
i
shall
say
something
that
will
give
him
the
victory
i
held
out
my
hand
to
her
and
begged
her
to
come
and
sit
by
me
and
tell
do
you
suppose
she
said
something
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
be
sorry
to
hear
you
repeat
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
answered
you
are
very
good
miss
jane
but
you
can
no
more
help
me
than
the
disciples
could
relieve
that
wretch
whom
only
christ
healed
this
kind
goeth
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
fasting
whereupon
she
snatched
a
book
from
the
table
and
left
the
room
i
did
not
see
her
for
several
hours
and
when
i
met
her
in
the
hall
a
few
moments
since
i
said
well
dear
which
won
the
victory
sin
or
my
little
girl
she
put
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
laughed
bitterly
and
answered
it
was
a
drawn
battle
neither
has
much
to
boast
of
and
we
lie
on
our
arms
watching
nay
glaring
at
each
other
let
me
be
quiet
a
little
while
and
do
nt
ask
me
about
it
i
have
a
suspicion
miss
jane
paused
sighed
and
frowned
i
should
think
you
might
persuade
her
to
confide
in
you
pooh
persuade
her
i
would
quite
as
soon
undertake
to
persuade
the
andes
to
dance
a
jig
as
attempt
to
discover
what
she
has
determined
not
to
divulge
if
you
knew
her
as
well
as
i
do
you
would
appreciate
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
persuade
her
to
do
anything
but
you
men
never
see
what
lies
right
under
your
noses
and
i
believe
if
you
lived
in
the
same
house
with
that
child
for
five
years
longer
you
would
understand
her
as
little
as
you
do
to
day
ulpian
shut
the
door
and
sit
down
here
close
to
me
dr
grey
complied
and
laying
her
shrunken
hand
on
her
brother
s
knee
miss
jane
said
hesitatingly
my
dear
boy
i
do
nt
know
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
and
indeed
i
do
not
see
my
think
it
is
my
duty
to
talk
to
you
pray
come
to
the
point
dear
janet
your
exordium
is
very
tantalizing
tell
me
frankly
what
disturbs
you
it
pains
me
to
call
your
attention
to
a
fact
that
i
know
can
not
fail
to
produce
annoyance
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
drawing
her
head
to
his
shoulder
answered
tenderly
my
precious
sister
i
have
seen
for
some
days
that
you
were
perplexed
and
anxious
but
i
abstained
from
questioning
you
because
i
felt
assured
whenever
you
deemed
it
best
to
confide
in
me
you
would
voluntarily
unburden
your
heart
now
lay
all
your
troubles
upon
me
and
keep
back
nothing
has
salome
grieved
you
oh
the
child
does
not
intend
to
grieve
me
ulpian

nt
you
imagine
what
makes
her
unhappy
and
restless
and
contrary
she
is
very
wayward
passionate
and
obstinate
confer
with
the
disreputable
bull
dog
who
stood
in
the
entrance
beckoning
with
friendly
wavings
of
an
abbreviated
tail
oh
much
afflicted
ben
why
did
you
delay
till
it
was
too
late
to
save
your
pet
from
the
rough
man
who
set
his
foot
upon
the
trailing
strap
and
led
poor
sanch
quickly
out
of
sight
among
the
crowd
it
was
bascum
but
he
did
nt
know
any
thing
why
where
s
sanch
said
ben
returning
a
breathless
voice
made
bab
turn
to
see
ben
looking
about
him
with
as
much
alarm
in
his
hot
face
as
if
the
dog
had
been
a
two
years
somewhere
with
the
ponies
stammered
bab
in
sudden
dismay
for
no
sign
of
a
dog
appeared
as
her
eyes
roved
wildly
to
and
fro
ben
whistled
called
and
searched
in
vain
till
one
of
the
lounging
men
said
lazily
if
you
are
looking
after
the
big
poodle
you
d
better
go
outside
i
saw
him
trotting
off
with
another
dog
away
rushed
ben
with
bab
following
regardless
of
the
rain
for
both
felt
that
a
great
misfortune
had
befallen
them
but
long
before
this
sancho
had
vanished
and
no
one
minded
his
indignant
howls
as
he
was
driven
off
in
a
covered
cart
if
he
is
lost
i
ll
never
forgive
you
never
never
never
and
ben
found
it
impossible
to
resist
giving
bab
several
hard
shakes
which
made
her
yellow
braids
fly
up
and
down
like
pump
handles
i
m
dreadful
sorry
he
ll
come
back
you
said
he
always
did
pleaded
bab
quite
see
ben
look
so
fierce
for
he
seldom
lost
his
temper
or
was
rough
with
the
little
girls
if
he
does
nt
come
back
do
nt
you
speak
to
me
for
a
year
now
i
m
going
home
and
feeling
that
words
were
powerless
to
express
his
emotions
ben
walked
away
looking
as
grim
as
a
small
boy
could
a
more
unhappy
little
lass
is
seldom
to
be
found
than
bab
was
as
she
pattered
after
him
splashing
recklessly
through
the
puddles
and
getting
as
wet
and
muddy
as
possible
as
a
sort
of
penance
for
her
sins
for
a
mile
or
two
she
trudged
stoutly
along
while
ben
marched
before
in
solemn
silence
which
soon
became
both
impressive
and
oppressive
because
so
unnsual
and
such
a
proof
of
his
deep
displeasure
penitent
bab
longed
for
just
one
word
one
sign
of
relenting
and
when
none
came
she
began
to
wonder
how
she
could
possibly
bear
it
if
he
kept
his
dreadful
threat
and
did
not
speak
own
discomfort
absorbed
her
for
her
feet
were
wet
and
cold
as
well
as
very
tired
pop
corn
and
peanuts
were
not
particularly
nourishing
food
and
hunger
made
her
feel
faint
excitement
was
a
new
thing
and
now
that
it
was
over
she
longed
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
then
the
long
walk
with
a
circus
at
the
end
seemed
a
very
different
affair
from
the
homeward
trip
with
a
distracted
mother
awaiting
her
the
shower
had
subsided
into
a
dreary
drizzle
a
chilly
east
wind
blew
up
the
hilly
road
seemed
to
lengthen
before
the
weary
feet
and
the
mute
blue
flannel
figure
going
on
so
fast
with
never
a
look
or
sound
added
the
last
touch
to
bab
s
remorseful
anguish
wagons
passed
but
all
were
full
and
no
one
offered
a
ride
men
and
boys
went
by
with
rough
jokes
on
the
forlorn
pair
for
rain
soon
made
them
look
like
young
tramps
but
there
was
no
brave
sancho
to
resent
the
impertinence
and
this
fact
was
sadly
great
newfoundland
dog
who
came
trotting
after
a
carriage
the
good
creature
stopped
to
say
a
friendly
word
in
his
dumb
fashion
looking
up
at
bab
with
benevolent
eyes
and
poking
his
nose
into
ben
s
hand
before
he
bounded
away
with
his
plumy
tail
curled
over
his
back
ben
started
as
the
cold
nose
touched
his
fingers
gave
the
soft
head
a
lingering
pat
and
watched
the
dog
out
of
sight
through
a
thicker
mist
than
any
the
rain
made
but
bab
broke
down
for
the
wistful
look
of
the
creature
s
eyes
reminded
her
of
lost
sancho
and
she
sobbed
quietly
as
she
glanced
back
longing
to
see
the
dear
old
fellow
jogging
along
in
the
rear
ben
heard
the
piteous
sound
and
took
a
sly
peep
over
his
shoulder
seeing
such
a
mournful
spectacle
that
he
felt
appeased
saying
to
himself
as
if
to
excuse
his
late
sternness
she
is
a
naughty
girl
but
i
guess
she
is
about
sorry
enough
now
when
we
get
to
that
sign
post
i
ll
speak
sanch
comes
back
but
he
was
better
than
his
word
for
just
before
the
post
was
reached
bab
blinded
by
tears
tripped
over
the
root
of
a
tree
and
rolling
down
the
bank
landed
in
a
bed
of
wet
nettles
ben
had
her
out
in
a
jiffy
and
vainly
tried
to
comfort
her
but
she
was
past
any
consolation
he
could
offer
and
roared
dismally
as
she
wrung
her
tingling
hands
with
great
drops
running
over
her
cheeks
almost
as
fast
as
the
muddy
little
rills
ran
down
the
road
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
m
all
stinged
up
and
i
want
my
supper
and
my
feet
ache
and
i
m
cold
and
every
thing
is
so
horrid
wailed
the
poor
child
lying
on
the
grass
such
a
miserable
little
wet
bunch
that
the
sternest
parent
would
have
melted
at
the
sight
do
nt
cry
so
babby
i
was
real
cross
and
i
m
sorry
i
ll
forgive
you
cried
ben
so
full
of
pity
for
her
tribulations
that
he
forgot
his
own
like
a
generous
little
man
shake
me
again
if
you
want
to
i
know
i
was
very
bad
to
tag
and
lose
sanch
i
never
will
any
more
and
i
m
so
sorry
i
do
nt
know
what
to
do
answered
bab
completely
bowed
down
by
this
magnanimity
never
mind
you
just
the
water
arose
the
long
line
of
the
nova
scotia
coast
which
bounded
the
horizon
while
far
up
arose
cape
chignecto
and
beside
it
towered
up
the
dark
form
of
a
lonely
island
which
they
knew
in
spite
of
the
evident
distortion
of
its
shape
to
be
no
other
than
ile
haute
the
wondrous
effects
which
can
be
produced
by
the
atmosphere
were
never
more
visible
to
their
eyes
than
now
the
coast
of
nova
scotia
rose
high
in
the
air
dark
in
color
apparently
only
half
its
actual
distance
away
while
the
summit
of
that
coast
seemed
as
level
as
a
table
it
seemed
like
some
vast
structure
which
had
been
raised
out
of
ile
haute
arose
to
an
extraordinary
height
its
summit
perfectly
level
its
sides
perfectly
perpendicular
and
its
color
a
dark
purple
hue
nor
was
cape
chignecto
less
changed
the
rugged
cliff
arose
with
magnified
proportions
to
a
majestic
height
and
took
upon
itself
the
same
sombre
color
which
pervaded
the
whole
of
the
opposite
coast
another
discussion
was
now
begun
as
to
their
best
plan
of
action
after
talking
it
all
over
it
was
finally
decided
to
go
to
st
john
there
they
would
have
a
better
opportunity
of
hearing
about
tom
and
there
too
if
they
did
hear
they
could
send
messages
to
him
or
receive
them
from
him
so
it
was
decided
to
leave
at
about
eleven
o
clock
without
waiting
for
high
tide
for
as
the
wind
was
fair
they
could
go
on
without
difficulty
after
coming
to
this
conclusion
and
learning
that
the
tide
would
not
be
high
enough
to
float
the
schooner
until
eleven
they
all
took
breakfast
and
stimulated
by
the
the
village
towards
the
light
house
by
ten
o
clock
they
were
back
again
the
tide
was
not
yet
up
and
they
waited
patiently
by
the
way
captain
asked
bart
what
s
become
of
solomon
solomon
o
he
took
a
basket
an
went
off
on

and

shore
what
shore

said
the
captain
pointing
towards
the
headland
at
the
upper
end
of
the
village
how
long
since
wal
jest
after

it

time

the

too
high
that
s
a
fact

antelope

cried
bart
starting
up
that
s
so
said
captain
corbet
i
m
afraid
something

happened
he
s
been
gone
too
long
two
hours
were
enough
the
boys
all
looked
at
one
another
with
anxious
faces
if
he
went
up
that
shore
said
bart
he
may
have
got
caught
by
the
tide
it
s
a
very
dangerous
place
for
anybody
let
alone
an
old
man
like
him
wal
he
did
go
up
thar
he
said
partic
lar
that
he
wanted
to
find
somethin
of
a
relish
an
would
hunt

thar
he
said
too
he

by
nine
i
m
certain
something

happened
cried
bart
more
anxiously
than
before
if
he
s
gone
up
there
he
s
been
caught
by
the
tide
captain
corbet
stared
and
looked
uneasy
wal
i
must
say
that
thar
a
dreadful
bad
place
an
him
an
old
man
a
dreadful
bad
place
he

down
here
by
this
time

captain
corbet
an

d
better
go
with
some
preparations
preparations
what
kind
of
preparations
o
ony
a
rope
or
two
said
captain
corbet
and
taking
a
coil
of
rope
over
his
arm
he
stepped
ashore
and
all
the
boys
hurried
after
him
i
feel
kine
o
safer
with
a
kile
o
rope
bein
a
seafarin
man
he
remarked
give

at

up
in
the
morning
the
cliffs
and
the
beach
a
startling
discovery
a
desert
island
a
desperate
effort
afloat
again
tom
slept
soundly
for
a
long
time
in
the
spot
where
he
had
flung
himself
the
sense
of
security
came
to
the
assistance
of
his
wearied
limbs
and
lulled
him
into
profounder
slumbers
there
was
nothing
here
that
might
rudely
awaken
him
no
sudden
boat
shocks
no
tossings
and
heavings
of
waves
no
hoarse
menacing
thunders
of
wrathful
surges
from
rocky
shores
nor
were
there
distressing
dreams
to
harass
him
or
any
anxieties
carried
from
his
waking
hours
into
the
land
of
slumbers
to
annoy
and
to
arouse
from
monday
night
until
this
time
on
thursday
he
had
known
but
little
sleep
and
much
fatigue
and
sorrow
now
the
fatigue
and
the
sorrow
were
all
forgotten
and
the
sleep
was
all
his
own
not
a
thought
had
he
given
to
the
land
which
he
had
reached
so
strangely
it
was
enough
for
for
hours
he
slept
there
lying
there
like
a
log
wrapped
in
the
old
sail
moving
not
a
limb
but
given
up
altogether
to
his
refreshing
slumber
at
length
he
waked
and
uncovering
his
head
looked
around
at
first
he
thought
that
he
was
in
the
boat
then
he
grew
bewildered
and
it
was
only
after
a
persistent
effort
of
memory
that
he
could
recollect
his
position
he
looked
all
around
but
nothing
was
visible
there
was
nothing
around
him
but
darkness
intense
and
utter
it
was
like
the
impenetrable
veil
that
had
enshrouded
him
during
the
night
of
his
memorable
voyage
he
could
not
see
where
his
boat
was
a
vague
idea
which
he
had
of
examining
its
fastening
was
on
by
his
impracticability
his
whimsicality
his
eccentricity
and
his
punctiliousness
nevertheless
there
was
in
him
that
which
excited
my
deepest
commiseration
the
wretchedness
and
the
pain
of
his
face
and
the
suffering
which
was
visible
in
his
attitude
all
touched
me
he
sat
crouched
down
shivering
shuddering
his
teeth
chattering
and
presented
a
deplorable
picture
of
one
who
struggled
vainly
against
an
overmastering
pain
my
resolution
was
shaken
by
this
i
rose
to
my
feet
mr
o
halloran
said
i
pardon
me
i
see
that
i
am
subjecting
you
to
very
great
suffering
if
you
sit
there
any
longer
exposed
it
would
be
but
poor
courtesy
to
subject
you
to
that
any
longer
and
so
i
do
nt
see
what
better
i
can
do
than
allow
you
to
have
your
own
way
i
ll
have
to
give
up
my
scruples
i
suppose
i
ca
nt
sit
here
any
longer
and
see
you
suffer
and
so
here
goes
i
m
willing
to
fire
as
you
wish
at
this
o
halloran
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
joy
the
first
shot
he
exclaimed
yes
said
i
the
first
i
ll
fire
if
you
insist
on
it
and
that
s
just
what
i
do
said
he
shivering
at
this
i
took
aim
bang
went
the
shot
i
afterward
found
that
it
passed
through
his
hat
o
halloran
now
raised
his
pistol
and
levelled
it
at
me
but
the
pleasure
of
his
triumph
had
excited
him
and
besides
he
was
shivering
from
head
to
foot
and
his
hand
could
scarcely
hold
the
pistol
and
his
benumbed
finger
could
scarcely
pull
the
trigger
he
fired
and
the
bullet
passed
through
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
and
close
to
the
doctor
s
head
me
boy
he
cried
flinging
down
the
pistol
there
s
no
ind

the
obleegeetions

home
again
the
growls
of
a
confirmed
growler
hospitality
the
well
known
room
vision
of
a
lady
alone
with
marion
interchange
of
thought
and
sentiment
two
beautiful
women
an
evening
to
be
remembered
the
conviviality
of
o
halloran
the
humors
of
o
halloran
and
his
bacchic
joy
we
all
hurried
away
from
the
ground
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
soon
reached
the
hotel
de
france
it
was
small
stuffy
and
rather
close
but
to
people
in
our
half
frozen
condition
the
big
canadian
stove
was
a
blessing
beyond
words
o
halloran
seemed
like
an
habitue
of
the
and
by
the
success
with
which
he
obtained
somethin
warrum
for
the
company
but
the
hotel
de
france
was
not
a
place
where
one
might
linger
and
so
after
waiting
long
enough
to
allow
the
heat
of
the
canadian
stove
to
penetrate
us
aided
by
the
blended
power
of
somethin
warrum
and
long
enough
also
to
give
oats
to
the
horses
which
after
all
must
have
had
the
worst
of
it
poor
devils
we
started
and
dragged
on
to
the
town
all
this
time
o
halloran
did
not
appear
to
have
recognized
jack
at
all
on
the
drive
out
this
might
have
been
accounted
for
but
in
the
hotel
de
france
o
halloran
had
a
full
and
perfect
inspection
of
him
if
he
did
recognize
him
it
certainly
did
not
appear
in
his
manner
he
exchanged
words
with
jack
in
a
tone
of
hilarious
cordiality
which
did
not
seem
as
though
he
considered
jack
an
enemy
and
jack
who
never
failed
to
respond
when
greeted
in
such
a
evident
that
o
halloran
had
not
the
smallest
idea
that
jack
was
that
identical
british
officer
whom
he
had
expelled
from
his
house
of
all
the
party
the
doctor
seemed
to
have
suffered
most
and
on
the
journey
back
he
kept
up
one
prolonged
growl
at
me
i
was
fated
he
said
to
bring
him
bad
luck
and
i
would
be
the
death
of
him
once
before
he
had
ridden
all
night
in
the
storm
for
me
and
now
here
was
another
fool
s
errand
he
seemed
inclined
to
consider
it
as
a
personal
insult
and
actually
felt
aggrieved
because
o
halloran
s
bullet
had
not
shattered
my
arm
or
penetrated
my
brain
thus
he
alternated
between
shivering
and
swearing
all
the
way
back
i
tell
you
what
it
is
macrorie
he
growled
if
you
ever
come
to
ask
my
help
again
on
any
occasion
whatever
i
ll
take
it
as
a
personal
insult
i
would
nt
have
come
this
time
but
i
thought
it
was
to
be
an
and
nonsense
dragging
a
fellow
over
the
country
all
day
to
see
a
couple
of
pistols
fired
in
the
air
what
sort
of
a
thing
do
you
call
that
and
here
am
i
in
for
it
yes
damn
it
man
i
say
again
in
for
it
to
any
extent
rheumatism
neuralgia
gout
inflammation
and
fifty
other
things
if
i
thought
you
d
have
any
of
them
i
d
feel
satisfied
but
no
you
re
all
right
and
can
afford
to
sit
there
grinning
at
the
sufferings
of
a
better
man
than
yourself
from
which
it
will
appear
that
the
doctor
was
savage
and
i
was
not
on
reaching
quebec
o
halloran
gave
us
all
a
comprehensive
invitation
to
dinner
but
the
doctor
could
not
accept
it
he
had
taken
cold
and
would
have
to
go
home
jack
could
not
accept
it
he
had
a
very
pressing
engagement
mr
mcginty
could
not
accept
it
for
he
had
some
important
business
so
o
halloran
pressed
me
i
alone
was
disengaged
i
had
no
o
halloran
was
urgent
in
his
invitation
our
duel
seemed
only
to
have
heightened
and
broadened
his
cordiality
i
was
dying
to
see
marion
or
to
find
out
how
she
was
so
what
did
i
do
why
i
leaped
at
the
invitation
as
a
matter
of
course
so
once
more
i
was
ushered
into
that
comfortable
and
hospitable
back
parlor
since
i
had
been
there
last
what
events
to
come
out
of
the
northwest
of
and
searching
fierceness
very
different
from
the
roistering
jolly
bluster
of
early
fall
i
have
put
the
strawberries
under
their
coverlet
of
leaves
pruned
the
grape
vines
and
laid
them
under
the
soil
tied
up
the
tender
plants
given
the
fruit
trees
a
good
solid
meal
about
the
roots
and
so
i
turn
away
writing
resurgam
on
the
gatepost
and
calvin
aware
that
the
summer
is
past
and
the
harvest
is
ended
and
that
a
mouse
in
the
kitchen
is
worth
two
birds
gone
south
scampers
away
to
the
house
with
his
tail
in
the
air
and
yet
i
am
not
perfectly
at
rest
in
my
mind
i
know
that
this
is
only
a
truce
until
the
parties
recover
their
exhausted
energies
all
winter
long
the
forces
of
chemistry
will
be
mustering
under
ground
repairing
the
losses
calling
up
the
reserves
getting
new
strength
from
my
surface
fertilizing
bounty
and
making
ready
for
the
spring
campaign
they
will
open
it
before
i
am
ready
while
the
snow
is
scarcely
melted
to
move
on
my
works
and
the
fight
will
commence
yet
how
deceitfully
it
will
open
to
the
music
of
birds
and
the
soft
enchantment
of
the
spring
mornings
i
shall
even
be
permitted
to
win
a
few
skirmishes
the
secret
forces
will
even
wait
for
me
to
plant
and
sow
and
show
my
full
hand
before
they
come
on
in
heavy
and
determined
assault
there
are
already
signs
of
an
internecine
fight
with
the
devil
grass
which
has
intrenched
itself
in
a
considerable
portion
of
my
garden
patch
it
contests
the
ground
inch
by
inch
and
digging
it
out
is
very
much
such
labor
as
eating
a
piece
of
choke
cherry
pie
with
the
stones
all
in
it
is
work
too
that
i
know
by
experience
i
shall
have
to
do
alone
every
man
must
eradicate
his
own
devil
grass
the
neighbors
who
have
leisure
to
help
you
in
grape
picking
time
are
all
busy
when
devil
grass
is
most
aggressive
my
neighbors
visits
are
well
timed
it
is
only
their
hens
which
have
seasons
for
their
own
signs
of
a
rich
soil
but
i
have
noticed
that
a
thin
poor
soil
grows
little
but
weeds
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
substratum
is
the
same
and
that
the
only
choice
in
this
world
is
what
kind
of
weeds
you
will
have
i
am
not
much
attracted
by
the
gaunt
flavorless
mullein
and
the
wiry
thistle
of
upland
country
pastures
where
the
grass
is
always
gray
as
if
the
world
were
already
weary
and
sick
of
life
the
awkward
uncouth
wickedness
of
remote
country
places
where
culture
has
died
out
after
the
first
crop
is
about
as
disagreeable
as
the
ranker
and
richer
vice
of
city
life
forced
by
artificial
heat
and
the
juices
of
an
overfed
civilization
there
is
no
doubt
that
on
the
whole
the
rich
soil
is
the
best
the
fruit
of
it
has
body
and
flavor
to
what
affluence
does
a
woman
to
take
an
instance
thank
heaven
which
is
common
grow
with
favoring
circumstances
under
the
stimulus
of
the
there
has
been
a
good
deal
said
in
poetry
about
the
fringed
gentian
and
the
harebell
of
rocky
districts
and
waysides
and
i
know
that
it
is
possible
for
maidens
to
bloom
in
very
slight
soil
into
a
wild
wood
grace
and
beauty
yet
the
world
through
they
lack
that
wealth
of
charms
that
tropic
affluence
of
both
person
and
mind
which
higher
and
more
stimulating
culture
brings
the
passion
as
well
as
the
soul
glowing
in
the
cloth
of
gold
rose
neither
persons
nor
plants
are
ever
fully
themselves
until
they
are
cultivated
to
their
highest
i
for
one
have
no
fear
that
society
will
be
too
much
enriched
the
only
question
is
about
keeping
down
the
weeds
and
i
have
learned
by
experience
that
we
need
new
sorts
of
hoes
and
more
disposition
to
use
them
moral
deduction
the
difference
between
soil
and
society
is
evident
we
bury
decay
in
the
earth
we
plant
in
it
the
perishing
we
feed
it
with
offensive
refuse
but
nothing
grows
out
of
life
and
beauty
for
our
rubbish
society
returns
us
what
we
give
it
pretending
to
reflect
upon
these
things
but
in
reality
watching
the
blue
jays
who
are
pecking
at
the
purple
berries
of
the
woodbine
on
the
south
gable
i
approach
the
house
polly
is
picking
up
chestnuts
on
the
sward
regardless
of
the
high
wind
which
rattles
them
about
her
head
and
upon
the
glass
roof
of
her
winter
garden
the
garden
i
see
is
filled
with
thrifty
plants
which
will
make
it
always
summer
there
the
callas
about
the
fountain
will
be
in
flower
by
christmas
the
plant
appears
to
keep
that
holiday
in
her
secret
heart
all
summer
i
close
the
outer
windows
as
we
go
along
and
congratulate
myself
that
we
are
ready
for
winter
for
the
winter
garden
i
have
no
responsibility
polly
has
entire
charge
of
it
i
am
only
required
to
keep
it
heated
and
not
too
hot
either
to
smoke
it
often
for
the
death
of
the
bugs
to
water
it
once
a
day
out
of
the
sun
pretty
constantly
but
she
does
all
the
work
we
never
relinquish
that
theory
as
we
pass
around
the
house
i
discover
a
boy
in
the
ravine
filling
a
bag
with
chestnuts
and
hickorynuts
they
are
not
plenty
this
year
and
i
suggest
the
propriety
of
leaving
some
for
us
the
boy
is
a
little
slow
to
take
the
idea
but
he
has
apparently
found
the
picking
poor
and
exhausted
it
for
as
he
turns
away
down
the
glen
he
hails
me
with
mister
i
say
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
find
some
walnuts
the
coolness
of
this
world
grows
upon
me
it
is
time
to
go
in
and
light
a
wood
fire
on
the
hearth
calvin
note
the
following
brief
memoir
of
one
of
the
characters
in
say
so
i
believe
it
paul
but
if
mr
brent
dies
i
never
can
bear
to
look
at
you
or
speak
to
you
or
hear
your
voice
or
your
name
again
him
yes
even
then
because
you
did
hurt
him
if
you
did
nt
mean
it
then
you
care
a
great
deal
about
mr
brent
ruthie
a
great
deal
i
should
nt
think
you
d
ask
such
a
question
paul
more
than
you
do
about
me
ruthie
why
of
course
i
do
more
than
i
do
about
any
body
said
ruth
impatiently
and
paul
turned
away
without
another
word
chapter
xxxvii
doctors
disagree
well
doctor
what
do
you
think
about
him
asked
zilpah
impatiently
as
the
doctor
finished
the
ample
dinner
with
which
the
housekeeper
had
hospitably
provided
him
before
she
asked
any
questions
well
ma
am
if
you
want
my
candid
outright
and
downright
opinion
about
mr
brent
yes
what
is
it
well
ma
am
it
is
that
he
is
a
dead
man
and
the
doctor
adjusting
his
spectacles
to
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
steadily
regard
ed
the
little
junta
composed
of
zilpah
richard
paul
freeman
and
ruth
who
breathlessly
waited
for
his
words
as
they
met
her
ear
ruth
turned
and
hiding
her
face
upon
zilpah
s
bosom
burst
into
hysterical
sobs
and
the
old
woman
with
tears
streaming
down
her
withered
cheeks
found
no
word
of
comfort
to
whisper
to
her
paul
freeman
turned
miserably
toward
the
open
door
yet
lingered
hoping
for
some
alleviating
word
to
this
terrible
sentence
and
richard
pursed
up
his
lips
as
if
to
whistle
then
glanced
uneasily
at
the
women
and
doubtfully
at
the
doctor
while
he
slowly
said
sho
it
a
nt
so
bad
as
all
that
i
guess
it
could
nt
well
be
worse
replied
the
doctor
dogmatically
the
man
is
injured
very
bad
inwardly
and
there
s
no
way
of
getting
at
an
inward
wound
to
see
what
it
is
there
s
a
couple
of
themselves
in
a
week
or
so
it
was
walking
with
them
ribs
playing
against
the
vital
organs
inside
of
him
that
did
the
mischief
i
expect
they
sort
of
tore
him
all
to
pieces
and
i
do
nt
see
how
he
s
going
to
get
mended
you
ca
nt
do
any
thing
more
about
it
asked
richard
still
whistling
softly
as
he
eyed
the
doctor
with
increasing
disfavor
i
do
nt
see
as
i
can
young
man
really
i
have
no
objection
to
coming
into
the
woods
again
say
day
after
to
morrow
but
its
pretty
hard
on
a
horse
and
i
really
do
nt
see
what
i
can
do
well
now
doctor
i
m
an
ignorant
sort
of
man
alongside
of
you
but
it
s
my
opinion
that
the
boss
is
going
to
get
over
it
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
he
d
ought
to
take
to
help
him
over
well
sir
what
asked
the
doctor
the
ring
toward
the
clown
at
a
circus
french
brandy
and
loaf
sugar
replied
richard
undauntedly
and
meeting
the
doctor
s
sneering
laugh
with
good
humored
indifference
well
that
s
a
new
cure
for
broken
bones
said
the
man
of
science
at
last
it
a
nt
broken
bones
you
said
they
d
heal
of
themselves
in
a
week
or
two
replied
richard
sententiously
well
what
s
your
brandy
and
loaf
sugar
going
to
do
anyhow
why
the
brandy
keeps
the
blood
a
circulating
lively
so
that
the
bruised
parts
wo
nt
die
before
they
heal
and
the
loaf
sugar
makes
em
heal
sugar
s
dreadful
healing
every
body
knows
said
zilpah
corroboratively
now
doctor
you
think
i
m
a
fool
but
you
just
hear
what
i
ve
seen
in
my
day
pursued
richard
rising
and
marhing
up
and
down
the
room
pausing
now
and
then
to
confront
the
doctor
with
some
sentence
more
emphatic
than
the
and
an
earnest
purpose
three
years
ago
i
was
on
a
job
with
a
man
named
sparks
it
was
down
in
the
state
of
maine
where
the
lumbering
is
carried
on
a
little
different
from
what
it
is
here
but
is
full
as
dangerous
this
man
was
a
great
fellow
for
taking
hold
of
every
thing
himself
though
he
was
the
boss
and
in
the
spring
when
it
came
to
rafting
the
lumber
down
the
river
he
was
here
there
and
everywhere
the
end
of
it
was
that
one
day
there
was
a
jam
just
above
the
rapids
and
not
a
fellow
on
hand
man
enough
to
go
out
on
the
raft
and
break
the
lock
till
sparks
himself
seized
up
an
axe
tossed
off
his
jacket
and
boots
and
just
waiting
to
have
a
rope
tied
round
his
waist
sprung
out
on
the
logs
that
were
bobbing
up
and
down
piling
one
over
another
and
grinding
away
like
as
they
were
alive
and
in
a
hurry
found
the
lock
hit
right
and
left
knocked
out
the
key
log
and
then
sprung
for
it
like
a
man
that
feels
the
devil
close
on
his
heels
and
the
church
door
open
all
ready
for
him
we
fellers
hurrahed
and
cheered
him
on
and
pulled
away
at
the
line
keeping
it
just
taut
and
not
pulling
a
bit
and
well
was
it
for
him
that
we
did
for
just
at
the
church
door
as
it
were
the
devil
caught
up
with
him
and
over
he
went
down
among
the
dead
men
we
all
thought
and
said
but
while
there
s
life
there
s
hope
and
we
hauled
away
at
the
line
and
after
five
minutes
or
so
up
he
came
looking
more
like
the
pieces
of
a
man
than
a
whole
one
and
hanging
to
the
end
of
the
rope
with
no
more
force
about
him
than
a
dish
cloth
we
got
him
ashore
and
carried
him
up
to
the
shanty
which
was
nt
far
from
the
river
the
indian
squaw
we
had
picked
up
to
help
cook
and
wash
for
us
while
we
stayed
in
that
camp
few
standard
writers
who
are
on
every
private
shelf
and
to
these
it
can
afford
only
the
most
slight
and
casual
additions
the
crowds
and
centuries
of
books
are
only
commentary
and
elucidation
echoes
and
weakeners
of
these
few
great
voices
of
time
the
best
rule
of
reading
will
be
a
method
from
nature
and
not
a
mechanical
one
of
hours
and
pages
it
holds
each
student
to
a
pursuit
of
his
native
aim
instead
of
a
desultory
miscellany
let
him
read
what
is
proper
to
him
and
not
waste
his
memory
on
a
crowd
of
mediocrities
as
whole
nations
have
derived
their
culture
from
a
single
book
as
the
bible
has
been
the
literature
as
well
as
the
religion
of
large
portions
of
europe
as
hafiz
was
the
eminent
genius
of
the
persians
confucius
of
the
chinese
cervantes
of
the
spaniards
so
perhaps
the
human
mind
would
be
a
gainer
if
all
the
secondary
writers
were
lost
say
bacon
through
the
profounder
study
so
drawn
to
those
wonderful
minds
with
this
pilot
of
his
own
genius
let
the
student
read
one
or
let
him
read
many
he
will
read
advantageously
dr
johnson
said
whilst
you
stand
deliberating
which
book
your
son
shall
read
first
another
boy
has
read
both
read
anything
five
hours
a
day
and
you
will
soon
be
learned
nature
is
much
our
friend
in
this
matter
nature
is
always
clarifying
her
water
and
her
wine
no
filtration
can
be
so
perfect
she
does
the
same
thing
by
books
as
by
her
gases
and
plants
there
is
always
a
selection
in
writers
and
then
a
selection
from
the
selection
in
the
first
place
all
books
that
get
fairly
into
the
vital
air
of
the
world
were
written
by
the
successful
class
by
the
affirming
and
advancing
class
who
utter
what
tens
of
thousands
feel
though
they
can
not
say
there
has
already
been
a
scrutiny
and
choice
from
many
hundreds
of
young
pens
in
a
fugitive
journal
comes
to
your
eye
all
these
are
young
adventurers
who
produce
their
performance
to
the
wise
ear
of
time
who
sits
and
weighs
and
ten
years
hence
out
of
a
million

it

t
is
therefore
an
economy

it

be

dr

he

good
travellers

though
they
cost
more
they
do
not
cost
much
more
and
there
is
the
good
company
and
the
best
information
in
like
manner
the
scholar
knows
that
the
famed
books
contain
first
and
last
the
best
thoughts
and
facts
now
and
then
by
rarest
luck
in
some
foolish
grub
street
is
the
gem
we
want
but
in
the
best
circles
is
the
best
information
if
you
should
transfer
the
amount
of
your
reading
day
by
day
from
the
newspaper
to
the
standard
authors
but
who
dare
speak
of
such
a
thing
the
three
practical
rules
then
which
i
have
to
offer
are
i
never
read
any
book
that
is
not
a
year
old
never
read
any
but
famed
books
never
read
any
but
what
you
like
or
in
shakspeare
s
phrase
in
brief
sir
study
what
you
most
affect
montaigne
says
books
are
a
languid
pleasure
but
i
find
certain
books
vital
and
spermatic
not
leaving
the
reader
what
he
was
he
shuts
the
book
a
richer
man
i
would
never
willingly
read
any
others
than
such
and
i
will
venture
at
the
risk
of
inditing
a
list
of
old
primers
and
grammars
to
count
the
few
books
which
a
superficial
reader
must
thankfully
use
of
the
old
greek
books
i
think
there
are
five
which
we
can
not
spare
homer
who
in
spite
of
pope
and
all
the
learned
uproar
of
centuries
has
really
the
true
fire
and
is
good
for
simple
minds
is
the
true
and
adequate
germ
of
greece
and
occupies
that
place
as
history
which
nothing
can
supply
it
holds
through
all
literature
that
our
best
history
is
still
poetry
it
is
so
in
hebrew
in
sanskrit
and
in
greek
english
history
is
best
known
through
shakspeare
the
scottish
ballads
the
german
through
the
nibelungenlied
the
spanish
through
the
cid
of
homer
george
chapman
s
is
the
heroic
translation
though
the
most
literal
prose
version
is
the
best
of
all
herodotus
whose
history
contains
inestimable
anecdotes
which
brought
it
with
the
learned
into
a
sort
of
disesteem
but
in
these
days
when
it
is
found
that
what
is
most
memorable
of
history
is
a
few
anecdotes
and
that
we
need
not
be
alarmed
though
we
should
find
it
not
dull
it
is
regaining
credit
schylus
the
grandest
of
the
three
tragedians
who
has
given
us
under
a
thin
veil
the
first
plantation
of
europe
the
prometheus
is
a
poem
of
the
like
dignity
and
scope
as
the
book
of
job
or
the
norse
edda
of
plato
i
hesitate
to
speak
lest
there
should
be
no
end
you
find
in
him
that
which
you
have
already
found
in
homer
now
ripened
to
thought
the
poet
converted
than
homer
reached
as
if
homer
were
the
youth
and
plato
the
finished
man
yet
with
no
less
security
of
bold
and
perfect
song
when
he
cares
to
use
it
and
with
some
harpstrings
fetched
from
a
higher
heaven
he
contains
you
see
the
ole
woman
s
been
helped
by
the
neighbors
and
he
ll
claim
shocky
to
be
a
pauper
and
they
a
nt
no
human
soul
here
as
dares
to
do
a
thing
contrary
to
pete
could
nt
you
git
him
over
to
lewisburg
i
ll
lend
you
my
roan
colt
ralph
thought
a
minute
he
dared
not
take
shocky
to
the
uncle
s
where
he
found
his
the
old
maid
who
was
everybody
s
blessing
he
could
ask
her
to
keep
him
and
at
any
rate
he
would
save
shocky
somehow
as
he
went
out
in
the
dusk
he
met
hannah
in
the
lane
chapter
xix
face
to
face
in
the
lane
in
the
dark
under
the
shadow
of
the
barn
ralph
met
hannah
carrying
her
bucket
of
milk
they
have
no
pails
in
indiana
he
could
see
only
the
white
foam
on
the
milk
and
hannah
s
white
face
perhaps
it
was
well
that
he
could
not
see
how
white
hannah
s
face
was
at
that
moment
when
a
sudden
trembling
made
her
set
down
the
heavy
bucket
at
first
neither
spoke
the
recollection
of
all
the
joy
of
that
walk
together
in
the
night
came
upon
them
both
and
a
great
sense
of
loss
made
the
night
seem
supernaturally
dark
to
ralph
nor
was
it
any
lighter
in
the
hopeless
heart
of
the
bound
girl
the
presence
of
ralph
did
not
now
hannah
said
ralph
presently
and
stopped
for
he
could
not
finish
the
sentence
with
a
rush
there
came
upon
him
a
consciousness
of
the
suspicions
that
filled
hannah
s
mind
and
with
it
there
came
a
feeling
of
guilt
he
saw
himself
from
her
stand
point
and
felt
a
remorse
almost
as
keen
as
it
could
have
been
had
he
been
a
criminal
and
this
sudden
and
morbid
sense
of
his
guilt
as
it
appeared
to
hannah
paralyzed
him
but
when
hannah
lifted
her
bucket
with
her
hand
and
the
world
with
her
heavy
heart
and
essayed
to
pass
him
ralph
rallied
and
said
you
do
nt
believe
all
these
lies
that
are
told
about
me
i
do
nt
believe
anything
mr
hartsook
that
is
i
do
nt
want
to
believe
anything
against
you
and
i
would
nt
mind
anything
they
say
if
it
was
nt
for
two
things
here
she
stammered
and
looked
down
if
it
was
nt
for
what
said
hannah
hesitated
but
ralph
pressed
the
question
with
eagerness
i
saw
you
cross
that
blue
grass
pasture
the
night
the
night
that
you
walked
home
with
me
she
would
have
said
the
night
of
the
robbery
but
her
heart
smote
her
and
she
adopted
the
more
kindly
form
of
the
sentence
ralph
would
have
explained
but
how
i
did
cross
the
pasture
he
began
but
just
here
it
occurred
to
ralph
that
there
was
no
reason
for
his
night
excursion
across
the
pasture
hannah
again
took
up
her
bucket
but
he
said
tell
me
what
else
you
have
against
me
i
have
nt
anything
against
you
only
i
am
poor
and
friendless
and
you
ought
nt
to
make
my
life
any
heavier
they
say
that
you
have
paid
attention
to
a
great
many
girls
i
do
nt
know
why
you
should
want
to
trifle
with
me
ralph
answered
her
this
time
he
spoke
low
he
spoke
as
though
says
that
i
ever
trifled
with
any
woman
he
lies
i
have
never
loved
but
one
and
you
know
who
that
is
and
god
knows
i
do
nt
know
what
to
say
mr
hartsook
hannah
s
voice
was
broken
these
solemn
words
of
love
were
like
a
river
in
the
desert
and
she
was
like
a
wanderer
dying
of
thirst
i
do
nt
know
mr
hartsook
if
i
was
alone
it
would
nt
matter
but
i
ve
got
my
blind
mother
and
my
poor
shocky
to
look
after
and
i
do
nt
want
to
make
mistakes
and
the
world
is
so
full
of
lies
i
do
nt
know
what
to
believe
somehow
i
ca
nt
help
believing
what
you
say
you
seem
to
speak
so
true
but
but
what
said
ralph
but
you
know
how
i
saw
you
just
as
kind
to
martha
hawkins
on
sunday
as
as
han
ner
it
was
the
melodious
her
pail
and
disappeared
standing
in
the
shadow
of
his
own
despair
ralph
felt
how
dark
a
night
could
be
when
it
had
no
promise
of
morning
and
dr
small
who
had
been
stabling
his
horse
just
inside
the
barn
came
out
and
moved
quietly
into
the
house
just
as
though
he
had
not
listened
intently
to
every
word
of
the
conversation
as
ralph
walked
away
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
by
calling
to
his
aid
the
bulldog
in
his
character
but
somehow
it
did
not
do
him
any
good
for
what
is
a
bulldog
but
a
stoic
philosopher
stoicism
has
its
value
but
ralph
had
come
to
a
place
where
stoicism
was
of
no
account
the
memory
of
the
helper
of
his
sorrow
his
brave
and
victorious
endurance
came
when
stoicism
failed
happiness
might
go
out
of
life
but
in
the
light
of
christ
s
life
happiness
seemed
but
a
small
element
anyhow
the
love
of
woman
might
be
denied
him
but
there
still
remained
what
was
infinitely
more
precious
and
holy
possibility
of
heroic
living
working
suffering
and
enduring
still
remained
and
he
who
can
work
for
god
and
endure
for
god
surely
has
yet
the
best
of
life
left
and
like
the
knights
who
could
find
the
holy
grail
only
in
losing
themselves
hartsook
in
throwing
his
happiness
out
of
the
count
found
the
purest
happiness
a
sense
of
the
victory
of
the
soul
over
the
tribulations
of
life
the
man
who
knows
this
victory
scarcely
needs
the
encouragement
of
the
hope
of
future
happiness
there
is
a
real
heaven
in
bravely
lifting
the
load
of
one
s
own
sorrow
and
work
and
it
was
a
good
thing
for
ralph
that
the
danger
hanging
over
shocky
made
and
observe
the
custom
of
her
earliest
youth
by
leaving
there
a
bunch
of
flowers
she
spent
most
of
the
day
in
a
cushioned
chair
she
was
too
weak
to
kneel
long
she
loved
to
sit
in
the
sunlight
holding
the
countess
s
hand
in
her
own
attenuated
fingers
then
she
would
speak
of
her
father
and
brother
and
say
that
on
the
morrow
they
would
surely
be
reunited
she
never
mentioned
sickness
or
pain
she
saw
her
companion
s
tears
falling
fast
at
times
but
she
would
only
wipe
them
away
with
a
smile
and
an
embrace
as
the
sunbeams
played
upon
her
wasted
features
fringing
her
hair
with
gold
and
encircling
her
with
a
brilliant
halo
the
countess
would
turn
away
from
the
lovely
vision
to
hide
her
emotion
and
whisper
to
herself
this
is
a
glimpse
of
the
world
beyond
the
grave
chapter
x
we
need
not
mourn
for
thee
here
laid
thy
grave
the
skies
are
for
thy
soul
the
cradle
and
the
nest
there
live
tasso
toward
the
close
of
november
on
one
of
those
bright
warm
days
when
winter
as
if
in
memory
of
the
departed
summer
puts
by
his
blasts
and
snows
the
countess
of
montfort
was
seated
at
the
bedside
of
the
lady
margaret
the
countess
though
in
the
bloom
of
health
and
youth
was
sad
and
tearful
the
maiden
though
her
breath
was
short
and
difficult
wore
a
smile
upon
her
lips
the
shadow
of
death
was
on
her
sunken
temples
and
had
touched
her
quivering
nostril
and
waxen
ear
through
which
the
light
came
as
through
porcelain
yet
the
eyes
were
closed
and
the
pale
lips
moved
and
the
wasted
hands
embracing
a
crucifix
were
joined
in
prayer
she
could
still
beg
god
to
heal
the
feud
how
edifying
how
beautiful
how
sublime
the
spectacle
sublimer
than
the
deeds
of
heroes
the
conceptions
of
poets
the
to
the
humblest
christian
moving
heaven
by
prayer
in
a
corner
of
the
room
a
small
statue
of
the
immaculate
mother
of
god
stood
upon
a
pedestal
the
marble
figure
breathed
all
that
purity
and
simplicity
so
striking
in
the
images
which
adorned
the
old
gothic
cathedrals
the
eyes
of
the
maiden
frequently
rested
upon
it
and
as
often
as
sunset
came
she
would
bid
the
countess
place
a
bunch
of
flowers
at
its
feet
thus
did
she
continue
to
the
end
of
her
life
the
pious
custom
of
her
infancy
all
was
still
in
the
darkened
chamber
and
the
rich
tapestry
hung
mournfully
from
the
walls
the
things
of
earth
make
the
earthly
heart
ache
in
the
presence
of
death
but
how
joyously
the
eye
of
faith
kindled
up
as
it
rested
on
the
face
of
the
meek
sufferer
the
door
opened
softly
a
light
step
entered
and
a
female
servant
whispered
something
to
the
countess
she
started
and
looked
suddenly
at
margaret
the
invalid
had
caught
the
whisper
low
as
it
was
as
she
pressed
her
white
fingers
to
her
breast
and
said
in
a
low
tone
god
be
praised
it
is
my
father
bring
him
to
me
is
this
dying
girl
his
daughter
is
this
attenuated
form
all
that
remains
of
his
noble
his
beautiful
his
darling
margaret
like
a
blasted
pine
the
stalwart
warrior
fell
upon
his
knees
with
a
groan
as
if
his
heart
had
burst
and
buried
his
face
in
the
curtains
henry
all
tears
and
sobs
caught
his
sister
s
outstretched
hand
and
held
it
to
his
heart
gazing
in
anguish
at
the
ruin
of
his
idol
behind
these
knelt
father
omehr
for
a
moment
the
man
triumphed
over
the
christian
and
he
too
felt
the
thorn
of
grief
in
his
throat
but
when
margaret
s
calm
eye
rested
on
him
and
her
meek
smile
beamed
out
he
felt
the
rapture
which
is
only
known
to
the
holy
when
a
soul
is
happily
returning
to
the
bosom
whence
it
came
let
said
the
lady
margaret
and
they
remained
some
minutes
in
silent
prayer
father
whispered
the
invalid
the
broad
chest
was
convulsed
and
the
moan
deepened
but
that
bent
crushed
figure
made
no
reply
father
she
repeated
as
her
hand
fell
in
a
caress
upon
her
parent
s
head
sir
sandrit
starting
at
her
touch
looked
up
and
seized
the
hand
a
minute
had
changed
his
face
as
if
a
year
had
been
ravaging
there
it
was
so
furrowed
so
haggard
he
gazed
but
an
instant
at
his
daughter
then
hid
his
face
again
muttering
but
one
word
margaret
father
said
the
maiden
to
father
omehr
who
now
stood
at
her
at
her
pillow
is
albert
of
hers
at
home
the
missionary
nodded
let
him
know
that
margaret
of
stramen
on
her
death
bed
entreated
him
to
fly
here
without
a
moment
s
delay
even
the
sound
of
that
hated
the
count
montfort
who
had
just
entered
the
room
suddenly
exclaimed
i
myself
will
deliver
your
message
my
child
as
quickly
as
horse
can
speed
margaret
endeavored
to
thank
him
but
exhausted
by
excitement
and
exertion
she
fell
back
upon
her
pillow
the
countess
prudently
led
the
unresisting
father
from
the
room
and
despatched
henry
to
administer
to
his
grief
i
am
changed
said
margaret
to
the
missionary
as
she
recovered
god
has
changed
you
for
himself
my
child
replied
the
old
man
struggling
with
the
weakness
of
human
nature
for
he
had
known
and
loved
her
from
her
infancy
i
have
hoped
so
even
in
the
recollection
of
my
many
sins
for
his
mercy
is
infinite
may
he
uphold
and
strengthen
my
father
and
teach
him
to
rejoice
in
the
change
he
now
deplores
the
countess
left
the
room
and
once
more
the
lady
margaret
opened
her
soul
to
her
first
confessor
the
watched
her
broken
slumbers
as
if
he
feared
each
might
be
the
last
a
thousand
sighs
of
anguish
and
affection
were
given
and
returned
before
another
day
began
to
dawn
how
precious
are
the
last
hours
of
life
in
our
inability
to
lengthen
let
her
pull
his
hair
out
by
the
roots
but
the
cars
went
singing
through
the
forest
and
rattling
over
ridges
till
it
was
time
to
part
from
the
pleasant
man
with
a
wig
then
they
went
on
shooting
under
arches
rambling
over
bridges
till
dotty
and
her
papa
had
come
to
their
journey
s
end
we
will
say
it
was
the
town
of
quinn
chapter
vi
new
faces
the
cliffords
lived
a
little
way
out
of
town
mr
parlin
took
a
carriage
at
the
depot
and
he
ria
s
the
little
girl
was
rather
travel
stained
her
gloves
were
somewhat
ragged
at
the
tips
from
her
habit
of
twitching
them
so
much
and
they
were
also
badly
soiled
with
fruit
and
candy
her
hair
was
as
smooth
as
hands
could
make
it
but
alas
for
the
style
hat
which
had
left
portland
in
triumph
it
had
reached
indiana
in
disgrace
its
tipsy
appearance
was
due
to
getting
stepped
on
and
being
caught
in
showers
dotty
s
neat
travelling
dress
was
defaced
by
six
large
grease
spots
where
they
had
come
from
dotty
could
not
conjecture
unless
that
sick
lady
with
a
bottle
had
spilled
some
of
her
cod
oil
on
it
out
of
a
spoon
the
child
had
intended
to
astonish
her
relatives
by
her
tidy
array
but
after
all
her
pains
she
had
arrived
out
west
in
a
very
sorry
plight
now
which
side
must
i
look
for
the
house
papa
at
your
right
hand
my
dear
the
then
a
stone
house
my
right
hand
thought
dotty
that
s
east
but
which
is
my
right
hand
she
always
knew
after
she
had
thought
a
moment
it
was
the
one
which
did
not
have
the
shapest
thumb
that
is
the
misshapen
one
she
had
pounded
once
by
mistake
instead
of
an
oilnut
o
yes
papa
see
the
flowers
the
flowers
and
only
to
think
they
do
nt
know
who
s
coming
p
rhaps
they
re
drinking
tea
or
gone
visiting
or
something
the
cliffords
were
not
at
tea
grace
and
cassy
were
reading
our
boys
and
girls
in
the
summer
house
with
their
heads
close
together
horace
was
in
the
woods
fishing
mr
clifford
at
his
office
his
wife
in
her
chamber
ruffling
a
pink
cambric
frock
for
wee
katie
rocking
as
she
sewed
as
for
katie
she
was
marching
about
the
grounds
under
an
old
umbrella
it
was
only
the
skeleton
handle
through
the
open
sides
the
little
one
was
plainly
to
be
seen
and
mr
parlin
thought
she
looked
like
that
flower
we
have
in
our
gardens
which
peeps
out
from
a
host
of
little
tendrils
and
is
called
the
lady
in
the
bower
hearing
a
carriage
coming
the
lady
in
the
bower
rushed
to
the
gate
flourishing
the
black
bones
of
the
umbrella
directly
in
the
horse
s
face
dotty
has
camed
she
has
camed
shouted
the
little
creature
dropping
the
umbrella
falling
over
it
springing
up
again
and
running
with
flying
feet
to
spread
the
news
nobody
believed
dotty
had
camed
it
seemed
an
improbable
story
but
grace
and
cassy
had
heard
the
wheels
and
they
ran
through
the
avenue
into
the
house
to
make
sure
it
was
nobody
but
one
of
the
neighbors
why
indeed
and
indeed
it
is
dotty
and
if
here
is
nt
uncle
edward
too
cried
grace
tossing
back
her
ma

screamed
little
flyaway
thrusting
the
point
of
the
umbrella
between
dotty
s
feet
and
throwing
her
over
can
i
believe
my
eyes
said
mrs
clifford
s
voice
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
down
she
rushed
with
open
arms
to
greet
her
guests
then
there
was
so
much
kissing
and
so
much
talking
that
nobody
exactly
knew
what
anybody
else
said
and
katie
added
to
the
confusion
by
fluttering
in
and
out
and
every
now
and
then
breaking
into
a
musical
laugh
which
the
mocking
bird
not
to
be
outdone
caught
up
and
echoed
it
was
a
merry
merry
meeting
you
dee
papa
bringed

nt
him
dotty
said
katie
flying
at
her
cousin
with
the
feather
duster
as
soon
as
grace
had
taken
away
the
umbrella
and
pointing
her
remarks
with
the
end
of
the
handle
you
s
o
you
darling
flyaway
said
dotty
if
you
would
nt
stick
that
handle
right
into
my
eyes
i
s
going
to
give
you
sumpin
returned
katie
putting
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
producing
a
very
soft
orange
which
had
been
used
for
a
football
it
s
a
ollinge
you
can
eat
um
cause
i
gived
um
to
you
thank
you
o
thank

i
am
to
see
you

look
just
the
same
and
no
different
o
no
i
m
is
growin
homely
replied
the
baby
cheerfully
velly
homely
hollis
said
so
by
the
time
dotty
s
crushed
hat
was
off
and
she
had
made
herself
ready
for
tea
trying
to
hide
three
of
the
six
grease
spots
with
her
hands
horace
appeared
with
a
little
birch
switch
across
his
shoulder
strung
with
fish
the
fish
were
few
and
small
as
if
he
had
caught
a
whale
he
did
not
say
he
was
glad
to
see
his
young
cousin
but
joy
shone
all
over
his
face
we
ll
have
times
wo
nt
we
little
topknot
said
he
taking
katie
up
between
his
fingers
as
if
she
had
been
a
pinch
of
snuff
is
you
found
of
ollinges
dotty
asked
flyaway
with
an
anxious
glance
at
the
yellow
fruit
in
dotty
s
hand
still
untasted
after
tea
the
orange
lay
on
the
lounge
i
s
goin
to
give
you
a
ollinge
said
katie
presenting
it
again
as
if
it
were
a
new
one
but
after
she
had
given
it
away
three
times
she
thought
her
duty
was
done
if
you
please
um
said
she
coaxingly
i
dess
i
ll
eat
a
slice
o
that
ollinge
so
she
had
the
whole
dotty
have
grew
painful
and
at
length
he
returned
to
himself
then
he
dismissed
the
idea
as
fanciful
and
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
as
though
he
were
witnessing
something
which
he
had
no
business
to
see
she
was
evidently
unconscious
of
his
presence
and
to
be
a
witness
of
her
emotion
under
such
circumstances
seemed
to
him
as
bad
as
eaves
dropping
the
moment
therefore
that
he
had
overcome
his
surprise
he
and
coughed
several
times
then
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
after
standing
for
a
moment
he
turned
once
more
as
he
turned
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
woman
she
had
heard
him
and
turned
with
a
start
and
turning
thus
their
eyes
met
illustration
she
turned
toward
a
picture
which
hung
over
the
fire
place
and
stood
regarding
it
fixedly
if
the
general
had
been
surprised
before
he
was
now
still
more
so
at
the
emotion
which
she
evinced
at
the
sight
of
himself
she
started
back
as
though
recoiling
from
him
her
eyes
were
fixed
and
staring
her
lips
moved
her
hands
clutched
one
another
convulsively
then
by
a
sudden
effort
she
seemed
to
recover
herself
and
the
wild
stare
of
astonishment
gave
place
to
a
swift
glance
of
keen
sharp
and
eager
scrutiny
all
this
was
the
work
of
an
instant
then
her
eyes
dropped
and
with
a
low
courtesy
she
turned
away
and
after
arranging
some
chairs
breath
and
stood
looking
at
the
doorway
in
utter
bewilderment
the
whole
incident
had
been
most
perplexing
there
was
first
her
stealthy
entry
and
the
suddenness
with
which
she
had
appeared
before
him
then
those
mystic
surroundings
of
her
strange
weird
figure
which
had
excited
his
superstitious
fancies
then
the
idea
which
had
arisen
that
somehow
he
had
known
her
before
and
finally
the
woman
s
own
strong
and
unconcealed
emotion
at
the
sight
of
himself
what
did
it
all
mean
had
he
ever
seen
her
not
that
he
knew
had
she
ever
known
him
if
so
when
and
where
if
so
why
such
emotion
who
could
this
be
that
thus
recoiled
from
him
at
encountering
his
glance
and
he
found
all
these
questions
utterly
unanswerable
in
the
general
s
eventful
life
there
were
many
things
which
he
could
recall
he
had
wandered
over
many
lands
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
had
known
his
share
of
sorrow
and
of
joy
seating
himself
once
more
memory
the
figures
of
the
past
one
by
one
and
compare
them
with
this
woman
whom
he
had
seen
out
of
the
gloom
of
that
past
the
ghostly
figures
came
and
passed
on
and
vanished
till
at
last
from
among
them
all
two
or
three
stood
forth
distinctly
and
vividly
the
forms
of
those
who
had
been
associated
with
him
in
one
event
of
his
life
that
life
s
first
great
tragedy
forms
well
remembered
never
to
be
forgotten
he
saw
the
form
of
one
who
had
been
betrayed
and
forsaken
bowed
and
crushed
by
grief
and
staring
with
white
face
and
haggard
eyes
he
saw
the
form
of
the
false
friend
and
foul
traitor
slinking
away
with
averted
face
he
saw
the
form
of
the
true
friend
true
as
steel
standing
up
solidly
in
his
loyalty
between
those
whom
he
loved
and
the
ruin
that
was
before
them
and
lastly
he
saw
the
central
figure
of
all
a
fair
young
woman
with
a
face
of
dazzling
beauty
high
born
inborn
delicacy
but
the
beauty
was
fading
and
the
charm
of
all
that
grace
and
delicacy
was
veiled
under
a
cloud
of
shame
and
sin
the
face
bore
all
that
agony
of
woe
which
looks
at
us
now
from
the
eyes
of
guido
s
beatrice
cenci
eyes
which
disclose
a
grief
deeper
than
tears
eyes
whose
glance
is
never
forgotten
suddenly
there
came
to
the
general
a
thought
like
lightning
which
seemed
to
pierce
to
the
inmost
depths
of
his
being
he
started
back
as
he
sat
and
for
a
moment
looked
like
one
transformed
to
stone
at
the
horror
of
that
thought
his
face
changed
to
a
deathly
pallor
his
features
grew
rigid
his
hands
clenched
his
eyes
fixed
and
staring
with
an
awful
look
for
a
few
moments
he
sat
thus
and
then
with
a
deep
groan
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
paced
the
apartment
the
exercise
seemed
to
bring
relief
i
m
a
cursed
fool
he
muttered
the
thing
s
impossible
yes
absolutely
and
gradually
he
recovered
himself
pooh
he
said
at
length
as
he
resumed
his
seat
she
s
insane
or
more
probably
i
am
insane
for
having
had
such
wild
thoughts
as
i
have
had
this
morning
then
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
looked
out
of
the
window
abstractedly
an
hour
passed
and
lord
chetwynde
came
down
and
the
two
took
their
seats
at
the
breakfast
table
by
the
way
said
the
general
at
length
after
some
conversation
and
with
an
effort
at
indifference
who
is
that
very
singular
looking
woman
whom
you
have
here
she
seems
to
be
about
sixty
dresses
in
black
has
very
white
hair
and
looks
like
a
sister
of
charity
that
said
lord
chetwynde
carelessly
oh
that
must
be
the
housekeeper
mrs
hart
mrs
hart
the
housekeeper
repeated
the
general
thoughtfully
yes
she
is
an
invaluable
woman
to
one
in
my
position
no
she
came
here
about
ten
years
ago
i
wanted
a
housekeeper
she
heard
of
it
and
applied
she
brought
excellent
recommendations
and
i
took
her
she
has
done
very
well
have
you
ever
noticed
how
very
singular
her
appearance
is
well
no
is
it
i
suppose
it
strikes
you
so
as
a
stranger
i
never
noticed
her
particularly
she
seems
to
have
had
some
great
sorrow
said
the
general
slowly
yes
i
think
she
must
have
had
some
troubles
she
has
a
melancholy
way
i
think
i
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
creature
and
do
what
i
can
for
her
as
i
said
she
is
invaluable
to
me
and
i
owe
her
positive
gratitude

agone
there
was

day
when
there
were
giants
in
the
land
ii
curambo
what
a
cloud
of
dust
comes
dashing
down
like
driven
gust
and
who
rides
rushing
on
the
sight
adown
yon
rocky
long
defile
swift
as
an
eagle
in
his
flight
fierce
as
a
winter
s
storm
at
night
blown
from
the
bleak
sierra
s
height
careering
down
some
yawning
gorge
his
face
is
flush
d
his
eye
is
wild
and
neath
his
courser
s
sounding
feet
a
glance
could
barely
be
more
fleet
the
rocks
are
flashing
like
a
forge
such
reckless
rider
i
do
ween
no
mortal
man
his
like
has
seen
and
yet
but
for
his
long
serape
all
flowing
loose
and
black
as
crape
and
long
silk
locks
of
blackest
hair
all
streaming
wildly
in
the
breeze
you
might
believe
him
with
friend
or
senorita
rare
he
rides
so
grandly
at
his
ease
but
now
he
grasps
a
tighter
rein
a
red
rein
wrought
in
golden
chain
and
in
his
tapidaros
stands
half
turns
and
shakes
two
bloody
hands
and
shouts
defiance
at
his
foe
now
lifts
his
broad
hat
from
his
brow
as
if
to
challenge

and

of
but
i
doubt
if
there
is
in
the
south
another
state
so
deficient
in
its
courts
as
ours
we
have
as
i
said
many
able
lawyers
but
seldom
an
able
judge
the
salary
is
so
small
that
a
lawyer
of
first
rate
ability
unless
he
be
a
man
of
property
and
such
men
he
added
in
parenthesis
with
a
slight
touch
of
dignity
which
did
not
escape
the
other
rarely
enter
the
professions
will
not
go
upon
the
bench
it
is
therefore
generally
occupied
by
men
of
inferior
learning
and
ability
and
as
we
have
no
supreme
court
and
every
judge
is
independent
in
his
circuit
there
is
of
course
no
uniformity
in
their
decisions
but
many
an
error
you
may
be
sure
i
reside
here
near
the
boundaries
of
two
circuits
i
and
systems
of
laws
i
am
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
that
of
my
own
circuit
but
i
dare
not
move
out
of
it
as
i
have
known
others
to
do
to
their
sorrow
even
here
whenever
a
new
judge
is
elected
we
shall
have
a
new
system
to
learn
for
like
every
schoolmaster
who
begins
by
throwing
out
of
the
schoolroom
all
the
text
books
which
his
predecessor
employed
he
will
fear
that
he
will
be
considered
nobody
unless
he
overrules
much
of
what
our
present
judge
has
decided
does
not
your
constitution
provide
for
a
supreme
court
it
does
but
bless
you
sir
the
people
are
almost
unanimously
opposed
to
its
establishment
they
say
that
they
are
already
too
much
worried
by
courts
to
think
of
making
any
more
of
them
the
lawyers
too
the
most
of
them
are
equally
opposed
to
it
because
they
know
hang
them
and
who
should
know
so
well
as
they
that
it
would
lessen
litigation
by
lessening
what
is
man
who
would
get
an
office
here
must
not
open
his
mouth
in
favor
of
a
supreme
court
he
might
as
well
avow
himself
a
disciple
of
alexander
hamilton
or
a
friend
of
the
administration
of
john
adams
they
had
just
reached
the
public
square
and
alighted
when
mr
parkinson
pointed
to
a
little
office
on
the
corner
of
it
into
which
two
men
were
entering
there
go
two
limbs
of
the
law
now
we
will
go
in
at
once
and
leading
the
way
he
walked
in
and
introduced
the
young
man
mr
overton
to
mr
sandidge
and
mr
mobley
mr
sandidge
elam
sandidge
attorney
at
law
overton
had
read
upon
a
shingle
as
he
entered
was
about
fifty
years
old
tall
with
very
long
legs
which
seemed
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
his
rather
short
body
from
the
fact
that
they
would
never
hold
it
straight
up
he
had
long
arms
long
hands
and
long
fingers
which
last
never
looked
clean
they
had
been
ever
so
fine
would
yet
have
looked
shabby
from
a
habit
he
had
of
chewing
tobacco
all
the
time
when
he
was
not
eating
or
asleep
and
spitting
on
himself
yet
for
all
these
drawbacks
mr
sandidge
had
as
it
seemed
an
ambition
to
appear
perfectly
and
universally
agreeable
his
countenance
when
he
looked
at
another
was
invariably
clothed
in
smiles
he
never
laughed
he
only
smiled
while
nature
had
given
him
no
very
acute
sense
of
the
humorous
and
while
therefore
he
never
felt
like
laughing
he
had
apparently
from
a
sense
of
duty
learned
to
smile
and
he
smiled
at
everything
if
one
said
good
morning
to
him
he
was
sure
to
smile
as
he
returned
the
salutation
if
one
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
concerning
his
health
complained
of
a
headache
he
smiled
the
most
cordial
sympathy
there
was
no
considerable
amount
of
cheer
conveyed
by
his
smiles
no
more
than
there
was
by
his
shabby
a
part
of
him
and
one
got
used
to
them
but
if
any
one
said
anything
funny
where
he
and
others
were
standing
and
no
person
smiled
except
the
invariable
sandidge
he
felt
that
the
joke
had
been
a
failure
when
mr
parkinson
introduced
mr
overton
mr
sandidge
arose
and
extended
his
hand
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
ah
you
young
dog
you
have
come
at
last
i
knew
you
would
mr
mobley
was
a
stout
fine
looking
man
about
twenty
three
years
of
age
of
the
middle
height
with
dark
complexion
very
black
hair
and
whiskers
and
a
fine
mouth
full
of
large
sound
teeth
of
perfect
whiteness
there
were
an
ease
and
grace
in
his
manner
and
an
expression
upon
his
face
which
marked
him
at
once
to
mr
overton
as
a
man
of
talent
and
education
immediately
after
the
introduction
mr
sandidge
looked
at
the
new
comers
and
then
at
mr
mobley
with
a
smile
which
the
latter
interpreted
at
once
and
he
rose
to
go
no
do
not
leave
mr
mobley
mr
parkinson
said
we
have
no
especial
business
with
mr
sandidge
but
came
to
see
you
both
so
please
to
remain
unless
you
have
business
which
calls
you
away
mr
sandidge
smiled
upon
mr
mobley
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
but
that
we
knew
that
he
was
bound
to
smile
at
all
events
we
should
have
suspected
that
he
was
infinitely
amused
by
the
idea
that
mr
mobley
should
have
had
any
business
of
such
pressing
importance
as
to
require
him
to
go
to
it
in
a
hurry
he
then
turned
to
mr
parkinson
and
smiled
inquiringly
for
this
was
the
first
time
that
that
gentleman
had
ever
called
on
him
except
upon
business
mr
overton
has
removed
to
georgia
with
a
view
of
establishing
himself
somewhere
in
the
state
in
the
practice
of
the
law
and
i
have
brought
him
here
to
make
him
acquainted
with
you
both
knowing
that
he
could
obtain
from
you
more
myself
besides
he
added
looking
at
mr
mobley
i
desired
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
extending
his
acquaintance
among
those
with
whom
he
might
spend
pleasantly
such
of
his
leisure
as
he
will
have
when
he
is
wearied
with
the
would
kill
me
in
a
month
ma
never
would
let
me
try
to
do
any
thing
and
if
i
did
i
was
sure
to
break
all
down
under
it
but
if
you
say
so
i
ll
no
lillie
i
do
nt
want
you
to
go
in
i
know
darling
you
could
not
stand
any
fatigue
i
only
wanted
you
to
take
an
interest
just
to
go
and
see
them
for
my
sake
well
john
if
you
must
go
and
must
keep
it
up
i
must
try
to
go
i
ll
go
with
you
next
sunday
it
will
make
my
head
ache
perhaps
but
no
matter
if
you
wish
it
you
do
nt
think
badly
of
me
do
you
she
said
coaxingly
playing
with
his
whiskers
no
darling
not
the
least
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
you
if
you
had
married
a
strong
energetic
woman
like
your
sister
i
do
admire
her
so
but
it
discourages
me
darling
i
d
a
thousand
times
rather
have
you
what
you
are
said
john
for
what
she
wills
to
o
john
come
you
ought
to
be
sincere
sincere
lillie
i
am
sincere
you
really
would
rather
have
poor
poor
little
me
than
a
woman
like
gracie
a
great
strong
energetic
woman
and
lillie
laid
her
soft
cheek
down
on
his
arm
in
pensive
humility
yes
a
thousand
million
times
said
john
in
his
enthusiasm
catching
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
i
would
nt
for
the
world
have
you
any
thing
but
the
darling
little
lillie
you
are
i
love
your
faults
more
than
the
virtues
of
other
women
you
are
a
thousand
times
better
than
i
am
i
am
a
great
coarse
block
head
compared
to
you
i
hope
i
did
nt
hurt
your
feelings
this
noon
you
know
lillie
i
m
hasty
and
apt
to
be
inconsiderate
i
do
nt
really
know
that
i
ought
to
let
you
go
over
next
sunday
o
john
ought
to
and
i
shall
try
my
best
then
john
told
her
all
about
the
books
and
the
lawn
tea
and
lillie
listened
approvingly
so
they
had
a
lawn
tea
at
the
fergusons
that
week
where
lillie
was
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
mr
mathews
the
new
young
clergyman
of
springdale
was
there
mr
mathews
had
been
credited
as
one
of
the
admirers
of
rose
ferguson
but
on
this
occasion
he
promenaded
and
talked
with
lillie
and
lillie
alone
with
an
exclusive
devotion
what
a
lovely
young
creature
your
new
sister
is
he
said
to
grace
she
seems
to
have
so
much
religious
sensibility
i
say
lillie
said
john
mathews
seemed
to
be
smitten
with
you
i
had
a
notion
of
interfering
did
you
ever
see
any
thing
like
it
john
i
could
nt
shake
the
creature
off
i
was
so
thankful
when
you
came
up
and
took
me
he
s
rose
s
admirer
think
it
s
shameful
the
next
sunday
lillie
rode
over
to
spindlewood
with
john
and
rose
and
mr
mathews
never
had
the
picturesque
of
religion
received
more
lustre
than
from
her
presence
john
was
delighted
to
see
how
they
all
gazed
at
her
and
wondered
lillie
looked
like
a
first
rate
french
picture
of
the
youthful
madonna
white
pure
and
patient
the
day
was
hot
and
the
hall
crowded
and
john
noticed
what
he
never
did
before
the
close
smell
and
confined
air
and
it
made
him
uneasy
when
we
are
feeling
with
the
nerves
of
some
one
else
we
notice
every
roughness
and
inconvenience
john
thought
he
had
never
seen
his
school
appear
so
little
to
advantage
yet
lillie
was
an
image
of
patient
endurance
trying
to
be
pleased
and
john
thought
her
as
she
sat
and
did
nothing
more
of
a
saint
than
rose
and
grace
who
were
laboriously
sorting
books
and
gathering
around
them
large
classes
of
factory
boys
to
whom
over
lillie
sat
back
on
the
carriage
cushions
and
smelled
at
her
gold
vinaigrette
you
are
all
worn
out
dear
said
john
tenderly
it
s
no
matter
she
said
faintly
o
lillie
darling
does
your
head
ache
a
little
you
know
it
was
close
in
there
i
m
very
sensitive
to
such
things
i
do
nt
think
they
affect
others
as
they
do
me
said
lillie
with
the
voice
of
a
dying
zephyr
lillie
it
is
not
your
duty
to
go
said
john
if
you
are
not
made
ill
by
this
i
never
will
take
you
again
you
are
too
precious
to
be
risked
how
can
you
say
so
john
i
m
a
poor
little
creature
no
use
to
anybody
hereupon
john
told
her
that
her
only
use
in
life
was
to
be
lovely
and
to
be
loved
that
a
thing
of
beauty
was
much
exhausted
on
her
return
to
appear
at
the
tea
table
she
took
to
her
bed
at
once
with
sick
headache
to
the
poignant
remorse
of
john
you
see
how
it
is
gracie
he
said
poor
dear
little
thing
she
is
willing
enough
but
there
s
nothing
of
her
we
must
nt
allow
her
to
exert
herself
her
feelings
always
carry
her
away
the
next
sunday
john
sat
at
home
with
lillie
who
found
herself
too
unwell
to
go
to
church
and
was
in
a
state
of
such
low
spirits
as
to
require
constant
soothing
to
keep
her
quiet
it
is
fortunate
that
i
have
you
and
rose
to
trust
the
school
with
said
john
you
see
it
s
my
first
duty
to
take
care
of

one
of
the
shrewdest
and
most
subtle
modern
french
writers
has
given
his
there
are
few
women
who
have
not
found
themselves
at
least
once
in
their
lives
in
regard
to
some
incontestable
fact
faced
down
by
precise
keen
searching
inquiry
one
of
those
questions
pitilessly
put
by
their
husbands
the
very
idea
of
which
gives
a
slight
chill
and
the
first
word
of
which
enters
wished
they
were
of
the
party
and
one
or
two
of
them
stopped
and
went
in
and
saw
the
new
made
bride
drank
to
her
health
and
took
a
piece
of
the
wedding
cake
home
to
dream
upon
it
is
to
be
observed
that
rose
had
requested
of
her
friend
sibyl
dacy
to
act
as
one
of
her
bridesmaids
of
whom
she
had
only
the
modest
number
of
two
and
the
strange
girl
declined
saying
that
her
intermeddling
would
bring
ill
fortune
to
sibyl
asked
rose
you
love
me
i
am
sure
and
wish
me
well
and
your
smile
such
as
it
is
will
be
the
promise
of
prosperity
and
i
wish
for
it
on
my
wedding
day
i
am
an
ill
fate
a
sinister
demon
rose
a
thing
that
has
sprung
out
of
a
grave
and
you
had
better
not
entreat
me
to
twine
my
poison
tendrils
round
your
destinies
you
would
repent
it
oh
hush
hush
said
rose
putting
her
hand
over
her
friend
s
mouth
naughty
one
you
can
bless
me
if
you
will
only
you
are
wayward
bless
you
then
dearest
rose
and
all
happiness
on
your
marriage
septimius
had
been
duly
present
at
the
marriage
and
kissed
his
sister
with
moist
eyes
it
is
said
and
a
solemn
smile
as
he
gave
her
into
the
keeping
of
robert
hagburn
and
there
was
something
in
the
words
as
if
they
had
a
meaning
in
them
that
asked
to
be
sought
into
and
needed
reply
there
rose
he
had
said
i
have
made
myself
ready
for
my
destiny
i
have
no
ties
any
more
and
may
set
forth
on
my
path
without
scruple
am
i
not
your
sister
still
septimius
said
she
shedding
a
tear
or
two
a
married
woman
is
no
sister
nothing
but
a
married
woman
till
she
becomes
a
mother
and
then
what
shall
i
have
to
do
with
you
he
spoke
with
a
certain
eagerness
to
prove
his
case
which
rose
could
not
understand
but
which
was
probably
to
justify
himself
in
severing
as
he
was
about
to
do
the
link
that
connected
him
with
his
race
and
making
for
himself
an
exceptional
destiny
which
if
it
did
not
entirely
insulate
him
would
at
least
create
new
relations
with
all
there
he
stood
poor
fellow
looking
on
the
mirthful
throng
but
with
a
strange
sadness
upon
him
it
seemed
to
him
at
that
final
moment
as
if
it
were
death
that
linked
together
all
yes
and
so
gave
the
warmth
to
all
wedlock
itself
seemed
a
brother
of
death
wedlock
and
its
sweetest
hopes
its
holy
companionship
its
mysteries
and
all
that
warm
mysterious
brotherhood
that
is
between
men
passing
as
they
do
from
mystery
to
mystery
in
a
little
gleam
of
light
that
wild
sweet
charm
of
uncertainty
and
temporariness
how
lovely
it
made
them
all
how
innocent
even
the
worst
of
them
how
hard
and
prosaic
was
his
own
situation
in
comparison
to
theirs
he
felt
a
gushing
tenderness
for
them
as
if
he
would
have
flung
aside
his
endless
life
and
rushed
among
them
saying
embrace
me
i
am
still
one
of
you
and
will
not
leave
you
hold
me
fast
after
this
it
was
not
particularly
observed
that
both
septimius
and
sibyl
dacy
had
disappeared
from
the
merrily
without
them
in
truth
the
habits
of
sibyl
dacy
were
so
wayward
and
little
squared
by
general
rules
that
nobody
wondered
or
tried
to
account
for
them
and
as
for
septimius
he
was
such
a
studious
man
so
little
accustomed
to
mingle
with
his
fellow
citizens
on
any
occasion
that
it
was
rather
wondered
at
that
he
should
have
spent
so
large
a
part
of
a
sociable
evening
with
them
than
that
he
should
now
retire
after
they
were
gone
the
party
received
an
unexpected
addition
being
no
other
than
the
excellent
doctor
portsoaken
who
came
to
the
door
announcing
that
he
had
just
arrived
on
horseback
from
boston
and
that
his
object
being
to
have
an
interview
with
sibyl
dacy
he
had
been
to
robert
hagburn
s
house
in
quest
of
her
but
learning
from
the
old
grandmother
that
she
was
here
he
had
followed
not
finding
her
he
evinced
no
alarm
but
was
easily
induced
to
sit
down
among
the
merry
company
and
partake
of
some
provided
in
sufficient
abundance
and
that
being
a
day
when
man
had
not
learned
to
fear
the
glass
the
doctor
found
them
all
in
a
state
of
hilarious
chat
taking
out
his
german
pipe
he
joined
the
group
of
smokers
in
the
great
chimney
corner
and
entered
into
conversation
with
them
laughing
and
joking
and
mixing
up
his
jests
with
that
mysterious
suspicion
which
gave
so
strange
a
character
to
his
intercourse
it
is
good
fortune
mr
hagburn
quoth
he
that
brings
me
here
on
this
auspicious
day
and
how
has
been
my
learned
young
friend
dr
septimius
for
so
he
should
be
called
and
how
have
flourished
his
studies
of
late
the
scientific
world
may
look
for
great
fruits
from
that
decoction
of
his
he
ll
never
equal
aunt
keziah
for
herb
drinks
said
an
old
woman
smoking
her
pipe
in
the
corner
though
i
think
likely
he
ll
make
a
good
doctor
enough
by
and
by
poor
kezzy
she
took
a
drop
too
to
tell
her
how
it
would
be
for
kezzy
and
i
were
pretty
good
friends
once
before
the
indian
in
her
came
out
so
strongly
the
squaw
and
the
witch
for
she
had
them
both
in
her
blood
poor
yellow
kezzy
yes
had
she
indeed
quoth
the
doctor
and
i
have
heard
an
odd
story
that
if
the
feltons
chose
to
go
back
to
the
old
country
they
d
find
a
home
and
an
estate
there
ready
for
them
the
old
woman
mused
and
puffed
at
her
pipe
ah
yes
muttered
she
at
length
i
remember
to
have
heard
something
about
that
and
how
if
felton
chose
to
strike
into
the
woods
he
d
find
a
tribe
of
policeman
and
felt
secure
i
will
be
soon
said
dick
who
also
observed
the
approach
of
the
policeman
i
d
do
it
now
only
i
ve
got
to
buy
some
gold
for
a
friend
of
mine
just
let
me
know
when
it
s
perfectly
convenient
to
take
a
lickin
tim
shuffled
off
glad
to
get
away
unharmed
and
dick
turned
to
phil
i
ll
give
him
a
lickin
the
first
time
i
catch
him
when
there
is
nt
a
cop
around
he
said
phil
left
his
friend
at
this
point
for
he
saw
by
the
clock
on
join
paul
hoffman
as
he
had
agreed
i
may
here
add
that
phil
s
wrongs
were
avenged
that
same
evening
his
friend
dick
administered
to
tim
the
promised
lickin
with
such
good
effect
that
the
latter
carried
a
black
eye
for
a
week
afterwards
chapter
xv
phil
s
new
plans
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
phil
reached
the
necktie
stand
of
his
friend
paul
hoffman
just
in
time
said
paul
are
you
hungry
a
little
that
s
right

re
going
to
dine
with
me
and
i
want
you
to
bring
a
good
appetite
with
you
what
will
your
mother
say
asked
phil
doubtfully
wait
and
see
if
you
do
nt
like
what
she
says
you
can
go
off
without
eating
where
have
you
been
i
went
down
to
wall
street
on
business
inquired
paul
with
a
smile
no
said
phil
seriously
i
forgot
you
do
nt
know
lucia
she
lived
in
my
home
in
italy
and
i
used
to
play
with
her
she
told
me
of
my
mother
that
s
lucky
phil
i
hope
your
mother
is
well
she
is
not
sick
but
she
is
thin
she
thinks
of
me
said
phil
of
course
she
does
you
will
go
home
and
see
her
some
day
i
hope
so
of
course
you
will
said
paul
confidently
i
saw
the
boy
who
stole
my
fiddle
continued
phil
tim
rafferty
yes
what
did
he
say
i
was
with
a
bootblack
the
one
they
call
ragged
dick
do
you
know
him
yes
i
know
dick
he
is
a
bully
fellow
always
joking
dick
wanted
to
lick
him
but
a
policeman
came
and
he
went
away
yes
then
he
will
be
sure
to
punish
him
it
will
save
me
the
trouble
the
walk
was
not
long
soon
they
were
at
paul
s
door
i
have
brought
company
to
dinner
mother
said
paul
entering
first
i
am
glad
to
see
you
phil
said
mrs
hoffman
why
have
you
not
come
before
how
is
that
phil
will
you
stay
now
said
paul
mrs
hoffman
looked
at
paul
inquiringly
phil
was
afraid
he
would
not
be
welcome
he
exclaimed
he
is
always
welcome
said
mrs
hoffman
where
is
your
fiddle
asked
jimmy
a
boy
took
it
said
phil
and
threw
it
into
the
street
and
a
wagon
went
over
it
and
broke
it
jimmy
was
quite
indignant
for
his
friend
when
the
story
had
been
told
it
s
lucky
for
tim
rafferty
that
he
is
not
suffer
if
i
was
a
big
boy
i
d
lick
him
said
jimmy
belligerently
i
never
saw
you
so
warlike
before
jimmy
said
paul
to
phil
this
sympathy
seemed
pleasant
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
midst
of
friends
and
friends
were
not
so
plentiful
as
not
to
be
valued
what
are
you
going
to
have
for
dinner
mother
asked
paul
i
am
sorry
paul
that
i
have
no
warm
meat
i
have
some
cold
roast
beef
some
hot
potatoes
and
an
apple
pudding
you
need
nt
apologize
mother
that
s
good
enough
for
anybody
it
s
as
good
as
phil
gets
at
his
boarding
house
i
am
sure
he
has
got
rather
tired
of
it
and
is
nt
going
to
stay
are
you
going
to
leave
the
padrone
asked
mrs
hoffman
with
interest
si
signora
said
phil
will
he
let
you
said
phil
you
see
mother
phil
would
be
sure
of
a
beating
if
he
went
home
without
his
fiddle
now
he
does
nt
like
to
be
beaten
and
the
padrone
gives
harder
beatings
than
you
do
mother
i
presume
so
said
mrs
hoffman
smiling
i
do
not
think
i
am
very
severe
no
you
spoil
the
rod
and
spare
the
child
is
phil
going
to
stay
in
the
city
no
the
padrone
would
get
hold
of
him
if
he
did
he
is
going
to
new
jersey
to
make
his
fortune
but
he
will
need
a
fiddle
i
am
going
to
lend
him
money
enough
to
buy
one
i
know
a
pawnbroker
who
has
one
for
sale
i
think
i
can
get
it
for
three
or
four
dollars
when
phil
gets
it
he
is
going
around
giving
concerts
how
much
can
you
make
in
a
day
phil
sometimes
i
make
two
especially
when
you
are
your
own
padrone
you
will
be
able
to
save
up
money
you
will
have
to
buy
a
pocketbook
phil
where
will
you
sleep
phil
asked
jimmy
interested
phil
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
not
thought
of
that
question
particularly
i
do
nt
know
he
said
i
can
sleep
anywhere
of
course
he
will
stop
at
the
first
class
hotels
jimmy
said
paul
like
all
men
of
distinction
i
should
nt
wonder
if
he
married
an
heiress
in
six
months
and
went
back
to
italy
on
a
bridal
tour
he
is
too
young
to
be
married
said
jimmy
who
it
will
be
perceived
understood
everything
literally
i
do
nt
know
but
he
is
said
paul
but
he
is
nt
too
old
to
be
hungry
so
mother
whenever
dinner
is
ready
we
shall
be
it
is
all
ready
except
peeling
the
ourselves
it
is
good
exercise
and
will
sharpen
our
appetites
you
will
have
to
eat
fast
or
there
wo
nt
be
much
left
jimmy
is
the
most
tremendous
eater
i
ever
saw
and
wo
nt
leave
much
for
the
rest
of
us
if
we
give
him
the
chance
now
paul
expostulated
jimmy
feeling
aggrieved
at
this
charge
you
bother
about
the
law
books
or
the
magnetic
pole
as
i
say
i
do
not
know
what
questions
polly
and
annie
put
but
to
give
them
their
due
they
had
put
on
paper
a
coherent
record
of
the
results
arrived
at
in
the
answers
though
what
were
the
numbers
of
the
despatches
or
in
what
order
they
came
i
do
not
know
for
the
session
of
the
synod
kept
us
at
assampink
for
two
or
three
weeks

husband
francis
duke
of
tuscany
was
hanging
about
loose
one
day
and
the
empress
who
had
got
a
little
tired
said
to
the
take
care
and
choose
a
husband
who
has
something
to
do
outside
of
the
house
mrs
brannan
was
the
spokesman
we
tried
a
good
many
experiments
about
day
and
night
it
was
very
funny
at
first
not
to
know
when
it
would
be
light
and
when
dark
for
really
the
names
day
and
night
do
not
express
a
great
deal
for
us
of
course
the
pendulum
clocks
all
went
wrong
till
the
men
got
them
overhauled
and
i
think
watches
and
clocks
both
will
soon
go
out
of
fashion
but
we
have
settled
down
on
much
the
old
hours
getting
up
without
reference
to
daylight
by
our
great
gong
at
your
eight
o
clock
but
when
the
eclipse
season
comes
we
vary
from
that
for
signalling
we
still
make
separate
families
and
alice
s
is
the
seventh
we
tried
hotel
life
and
we
liked
it
for
there
has
never
been
the
first
quarrel
here
you
ca
nt
quarrel
here
where
you
are
never
sick
never
tired
and
that
it
was
nicer
for
the
children
and
for
all
round
to
live
separately
and
come
together
at
parties
to
church
at
signal
time
and
so
on
we
had
something
to
say
then
something
to
teach
and
something
to
learn
since
the
carices
developed
so
nicely
into
flax
we
have
had
one
great
comfort
which
we
had
lost
before
in
being
able
to
make
and
use
paper
we
have
had
great
fun
and
we
think
the
children
have
made
great
improvement
in
writing
novels
for
the
union
the
union
is
the
old
union
for
christian
work
that
we
had
in
dear
old
no
we
have
two
serial
novels
going
on
one
called
diana
of
carrotook
and
the
other
called
ups
and
downs
the
first
by
levi
ross
and
the
other
by
my
blanche
they
are
really
very
good
and
i
wish
we
could
send
them
to
you
but
they
would
not
be
worth
despatching
we
get
up
at
eight
dress
and
fix
people
choose
breakfast
and
then
we
meet
for
prayers
outside
where
we
meet
depends
on
the
temperature
for
we
can
choose
any
temperature
we
want
from
boiling
water
down
which
is
convenient
after
prayers
an
hour
s
talk
lounging
walking
and
so
on
no
flirting
but
a
favorite
time
with
the
young
folks
then
comes
work
three
hours
head
work
is
the
maximum
in
that
line
of
women
s
work
as
in
all
worlds
there
are
twenty
four
in
one
of
your
days
but
for
my
part
i
like
it
farmers
and
carpenters
have
their
own
laws
as
the
light
serves
and
the
seasons
dinner
is
seven
hours
after
breakfast
began
always
an
hour
long
as
breakfast
was
then
every
human
being
sleeps
for
an
hour
big
gong
again
and
we
ride
walk
swim
telegraph
or
what
not
as
the
case
may
be
we
have
no
horses
yet
but
the
shanghaes
are
coming
up
into
very
good
dodos
the
children
only
two
persons
of
a
family
take
tea
at
home
the
rest
always
go
out
to
tea
without
invitation
at
p
m
big
gong
again
and
we
meet
in
grace
which
is
the
prettiest
hall
church
concert
room
that
you
ever
saw
we
have
singing
lectures
theatre
dancing
talk
or
what
the
mistress
of
the
night
determines
till
the
curfew
sounds
at
ten
and
then
we
all
go
home
evening
prayers
are
in
the
separate
households
and
every
one
is
in
bed
by
midnight
the
only
law
on
the
statute
book
is
that
every
one
shall
sleep
nine
hours
out
of
every
twenty
four
only
one
thing
interrupts
this
general
order
three
taps
on
the
gong
means
telegraph
and
then
i
tell
you
we
are
all
on
hand
you
can
not
think
how
quickly
the
days
and
years
go
by
of
course
however
as
i
said
this
could
not
last
we
could
not
subdue
our
dear
b
m
could
it
be
possible
perhaps
it
was
possible
that
they
there
had
something
else
to
think
of
and
to
do
besides
attending
to
our
affairs
certainly
their
indifference
to
grant
s
fourth
proclamation
and
to
mr
fish
s
celebrated
protocol
in
the
tahiti
business
looked
that
way
could
it
be
that
that
little
witch
of
a
belle
brannan
really
cared
more
for
their
performance
of
midsummer
night
s
dream
or
her
father
s
birthday
than
she
cared
for
that
pleasant
little
account
i
telegraphed
up
to
all
the
children
of
the
way
we
went
to
muster
when
we
were
boys
together
ah
well
i
ought
not
to
have
supposed
that
all
worlds
were
like
this
old
world
indeed
i
often
say
this
is
the
queerest
world
i
ever
knew
perhaps
theirs
is
not
so
queer
and
it
is
i
who
am
the
oddity
of
course
it
could
not
last
we
just
arranged
correspondence
days
when
we
would
send
to
them
and
they
to
us
i
was
meanwhile
turned
out
from
my
work
well
and
polly
hers
the
observer
s
room
was
a
miracle
of
neatness
the
children
were
kept
in
the
basement
visitors
were
received
with
great
courtesy
and
all
the
fees
were
sent
to
the
treasurer
he
got
three
dollars
and
eleven
cents
one
summer
that
was
the
year
general
grant
came
there
and
that
was
the
largest
amount
that
they
ever
received
from
any
source
but
begging
i
was
not
unfaithful
to
my
trust
nor
was
it
for
her
who
told
you
that
julia
was
so
used
to
hearing
her
mother
speak
in
an
excited
way
that
she
hardly
noticed
the
strange
tremor
in
this
question
august
the
symphony
ceased
in
a
moment
the
scrubbing
brush
dropped
in
the
pail
of
soapsuds
but
the
vocal
storm
burst
forth
with
a
violence
that
startled
even
julia
august
said
that
did
he
and
you
listened
did
you
you
listened
to
that
you
listened
to
that
you
listened
to
that
hey
he
standered
your
mother
by
this
time
mrs
anderson
was
at
white
heat
julia
was
speechless
i
saw
you
yesterday
flirting
with
that
dutchman
and
listening
to
his
abuse
of
your
mother
and
now
you
insult
me
well
to
morrow
will
be
the
last
day
that
that
dutchman
will
hold
a
plow
on
this
place
and
you
d
better
look
out
for
yourself
miss
you
here
followed
a
volley
of
epithets
which
julia
received
standing
but
when
her
mother
s
voice
grew
to
a
scream
julia
took
the
word
mother
hush
it
was
the
first
word
of
resistance
she
had
ever
uttered
the
agony
within
must
have
been
terrible
to
have
wrung
it
from
her
the
mother
was
stunned
with
anger
and
astonishment
she
could
not
recover
herself
enough
to
speak
until
jule
had
fled
half
way
up
the
stairs
then
her
mother
covered
her
defeat
by
screaming
after
her
go
to
your
own
room
you
impudent
hussy
you
know
i
am
liable
to
die
of
heart
disease
any
minute
a
farewell
mrs
anderson
felt
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
she
had
not
meant
to
tell
julia
that
august
was
to
leave
but
now
that
this
stormy
scene
had
taken
place
she
thought
she
could
make
a
good
use
of
it
she
knew
that
her
husband
co
operated
with
her
in
her
opposition
to
the
dutchman
only
because
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
in
his
heart
samuel
anderson
could
not
refuse
anything
to
his
daughter
denied
any
of
the
happiness
which
most
men
find
in
loving
their
wives
he
found
consolation
in
the
love
of
his
daughter
secretly
as
though
his
paternal
affection
were
a
crime
he
caressed
julia
and
his
wife
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
the
father
cared
more
for
a
loving
daughter
than
for
a
shrewish
wife
she
watched
him
jealously
and
had
come
to
regard
her
daughter
as
one
who
had
supplanted
her
in
her
husband
s
affections
and
her
husband
as
robbing
her
of
the
love
of
her
daughter
in
truth
guard
against
imaginary
encroachments
on
her
rights
that
she
saw
enemies
everywhere
she
hated
wehle
because
he
was
a
dutchman
she
would
have
hated
him
on
a
dozen
other
scores
if
he
had
been
an
american
it
was
offense
enough
that
julia
loved
him
so
now
she
resolved
to
gain
her
husband
to
her
side
by
her
version
of
the
story
and
before
dinner
she
had
told
him
how
august
had
charged
her
with
being
false
and
cruel
to
andrew
many
years
ago
and
how
jule
had
thrown
it
up
to
her
and
how
near
she
had
come
to
dropping
down
with
palpitation
of
the
heart
and
samuel
anderson
reddened
and
declared
that
he
would
protect
his
wife
from
such
insults
the
notion
that
he
protected
his
wife
was
a
pleasant
fiction
of
the
little
man
s
which
received
a
generous
encouragement
at
the
hands
of
his
wife
it
was
a
favorite
trick
of
hers
to
throw
herself
in
a
metaphorical
way
at
his
feet
a
helpless
woman
and
in
her
feebleness
implore
his
in
defending
his
inoffensive
wife
under
cover
of
this
fiction
so
flattering
to
the
vanity
of
an
overawed
husband
she
had
managed
at
one
time
or
another
to
embroil
him
with
almost
all
the
neighbors
and
his
refusal
to
join
fences
had
resulted
in
that
crooked
arrangement
known
as
a
devil
s
lane
on
three
sides
of
his
farm
julia
dared
not
stay
away
from
dinner
which
was
miserable
enough
she
did
not
venture
so
much
as
to
look
at
august
who
sat
opposite
her
and
who
was
the
most
unhappy
person
at
the
table
because
he
did
not
know
what
all
the
unhappiness
was
about
mr
anderson
s
brow
foreboded
a
storm
mrs
anderson
s
face
was
full
of
an
earthquake
cynthy
ann
was
sitting
in
shadow
and
julia
s
countenance
perplexed
him
whether
she
was
angry
with
him
or
not
he
could
not
be
sure
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
she
was
suffering
a
great
deal
and
that
was
enough
to
make
him
exceedingly
unhappy
sitting
electricity
he
got
the
notion
he
could
hardly
tell
how
that
all
this
lowering
of
the
sky
had
something
to
do
with
him
what
had
he
done
nothing
his
closest
self
examination
told
him
that
he
had
done
no
wrong
but
his
spirits
were
depressed
and
his
sensitive
conscience
condemned
him
for
some
unknown
crime
that
had
brought
about
all
this
disturbance
of
the
elements
the
ham
did
not
seem
very
good
the
cabbage
he
could
not
eat
the
corn
dodger
choked
him
he
had
no
desire
to
wait
for
the
pie
he
abridged
his
meal
and
went
out
to
the
barn
to
keep
company
with
his
horses
and
his
misery
until
it
should
be
time
to
return
to
his
plow
julia
sat
and
sewed
in
that
tedious
afternoon
she
would
have
liked
one
more
interview
with
august
before
his
departure
looking
through
the
open
hall
she
saw
him
leave
the
barn
and
go
toward
his
plowing
not
that
she
looked
up
hawk
never
watched
chicken
more
closely
than
mrs
anderson
watched
poor
jule
saw
him
drive
his
horses
before
him
from
the
stable
as
the
field
in
which
he
worked
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
from
where
she
sat
she
could
not
so
much
as
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
held
his
plow
on
its
steady
course
she
wished
she
might
have
helped
cynthy
ann
in
the
kitchen
for
then
she
could
from
a
better
education
possibly
more
refined
associations
gave
them
an
attraction
which
was
none
the
less
felt
because
it
was
not
understood
to
the
simple
minded
young
men
who
worked
with
the
hired
hands
in
their
fathers
fields
if
the
donnelly
family
had
not
been
accustomed
in
former
days
to
sit
at
the
same
table
with
laborers
in
shirt
sleeves
and
be
addressed
by
the
latter
in
fraternal
phrase
no
little
awkwardnesses
or
hesitations
betrayed
the
fact
they
were
anxious
to
make
their
naturalization
complete
and
it
soon
became
so
the
strange
friend
was
now
known
in
londongrove
by
the
familiar
name
of
henry
he
was
a
constant
attendant
at
meeting
not
only
on
first
days
but
also
on
fourth
days
and
whenever
he
spoke
his
words
were
listened
to
with
the
reverence
due
to
one
who
was
truly
led
towards
that
might
still
have
lingered
in
some
minds
concerning
his
antecedent
life
it
was
known
that
he
answered
simon
pennock
who
had
ventured
to
approach
him
with
a
direct
question
in
these
words
thee
knows
friend
simon
that
sometimes
a
seal
is
put
upon
our
mouths
for
a
wise
purpose
i
have
learned
not
to
value
the
outer
life
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
made
the
manifestation
of
the
inner
life
and
i
only
date
my
own
from
the
time
when
i
was
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
it
is
not
pleasant
to
me
to
look
upon
what
went
before
but
a
season
may
come
when
it
shall
be
lawful
for
me
to
declare
all
things
nay
when
it
shall
be
put
upon
me
as
a
duty
thee
must
suffer
me
to
wait
the
call
after
this
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
the
family
was
on
terms
of
quiet
intimacy
with
the
neighbors
and
even
sylvia
in
spite
of
her
defiant
eyes
and
worldly
ways
she
touched
her
beloved
guitar
with
a
skill
which
seemed
marvellous
to
the
latter
and
when
it
was
known
that
her
refusal
to
enter
the
sect
arose
from
her
fondness
for
the
prohibited
instrument
she
found
many
apologists
among
them
she
was
not
set
upon
and
called
hard
names
as
she
had
anticipated
it
is
true
that
her
father
when
appealed
to
by
the
elders
shook
his
head
and
said
it
is
a
cross
to
us
but
he
had
been
known
to
remain
in
the
room
while
she
sang
full
high
in
kilbride
and
the
keen
light
which
arose
in
his
eyes
was
neither
that
of
sorrow
nor
anger
at
the
end
of
their
first
year
of
residence
the
farm
presented
evidences
of
much
more
orderly
and
intelligent
management
than
at
first
although
the
adjoining
neighbors
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
donnellys
had
hardly
made
their
living
out
of
it
friend
henry
nevertheless
was
ready
with
the
advance
rent
and
his
bills
were
promptly
paid
he
was
merit
than
otherwise
and
almost
painfully
exact
in
observing
the
strict
letter
of
it
when
made
as
time
passed
by
and
the
family
became
a
permanent
part
and
parcel
of
the
remote
community
wearing
its
peaceful
color
and
breathing
its
untroubled
atmosphere
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
the
esteem
and
respect
which
its
members
enjoyed
from
time
to
time
the
postmaster
at
the
corner
delivered
to
henry
donnelly
a
letter
from
new
york
always
addressed
in
the
same
hand
the
first
which
arrived
had
an
esq
added
to
the
name
but
this
compliment
as
the
friends
termed
it
soon
ceased
perhaps
the
official
may
have
vaguely
wondered
whether
there
was
any
connection
between
the
occasional
absence
of
friend
henry
not
at
yearly
meeting
time
and
these
letters
if
he
had
been
a
visitor
at
the
farm
house
he
might
have
noticed
variations
in
the
moods
of
its
inmates
which
must
have
arisen
from
some
other
cause
than
the
price
of
stock
or
the
condition
of
the
crops
outside
of
the
in
five
or
six
years
when
de
courcy
had
grown
to
be
a
hale
handsome
man
of
twenty
four
and
as
capable
of
conducting
a
farm
as
any
to
the
township
born
certain
aberrations
from
the
strict
line
of
discipline
began
to
be
rumored
he
rode
a
gallant
horse
dressed
a
little
more
elegantly
than
his
membership
prescribed
and
his
unusually
high
straight
collar
took
a
knack
of
falling
over
moreover
he
was
frequently
seen
to
ride
up
the
street
road
in
the
direction
of
fagg
s
manor
towards
those
valleys
where
the
brick
presbyterian
church
displaces
the
whitewashed
quaker
meeting
house
had
henry
donnelly
not
occupied
so
high
a
seat
and
exercised
such
an
acknowledged
authority
in
the
sect
he
might
sooner
have
received
counsel
or
proffers
of
sympathy
as
the
case
might
be
but
he
heard
nothing
until
the
rumors
of
de
courcy
s
excursions
took
a
more
definite
form
but
one
day
abraham
bradbury
after
discussing
some
monthly
meeting
matters
suddenly
asked
is
this
true
that
i
keeps
company
with
one
of
the
alison
girls
who
says
that
henry
asked
in
a
sharp
voice
why
it
s
the
common
talk
surely
thee
s
heard
of
it
before
no
henry
set
his
lips
together
in
a
manner
which
abraham
understood
considering
that
he
had
fully
performed
his
duty
he
said
no
more
that
evening
sylvia
who
had
been
gently
thrumming
to
herself
at
the
window
began
singing
bonnie
peggie
alison
her
father
looked
at
de
courcy
who
caught
his
glance
then
lowered
his
eyes
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
stop
de
courcy
said
the
former
i
ve
heard
a
piece
of
news
about
thee
to
day
which
i
want
thee
to
make
clear
shall
i
go
father
asked
sylvia
no
thee
may
stay
to
give
de
courcy
his
memory
i
think
he
is
beginning
to
need
it
i
ve
learned
which
way
i
am
old
enough
to
choose
my
way
said
de
courcy
but
no
such
ways
now
boy
has
thee
clean
forgotten
this
was
among
the
things
upon
which
we
agreed
and
you
all
promised
to
lift
her
eyes
from
fear
that
eliza
would
see
how
foolish
she
was
to
care
about
what
the
little
french
woman
said
eliza
saw
all
this
but
it
only
made
that
grim
smile
broader
and
deeper
on
her
own
face
and
when
the
golden
brown
hair
was
frizzed
and
rolled
and
dropped
in
two
rich
curls
on
that
white
shoulder
she
turned
her
face
upon
the
french
woman
and
said
very
nice
in
on
one
side
and
nod
it
half
a
dozen
times
while
she
answered
yes
i
tink
so
india
gauze
was
dropped
like
a
cloud
over
caroline
s
head
the
sash
of
purplish
blue
was
girded
around
her
waist
and
bunched
up
in
superb
bows
behind
then
the
cloudy
stuff
was
gathered
up
in
drapery
from
a
silken
under
skirt
tinted
like
the
sash
and
fastened
back
with
clusters
of
the
moss
roses
this
completed
the
toilet
no
jewels
were
there
not
even
a
string
of
pearls
though
olympia
had
ropes
of
them
and
caroline
rather
sighed
for
their
completeness
when
she
took
a
full
length
view
of
herself
in
the
mirror
as
foolish
girls
will
who
never
learn
the
value
of
simplicity
and
freshness
until
both
are
lost
then
the
little
french
woman
went
away
to
olympia
giving
caroline
plenty
of
time
for
reflection
the
first
thing
the
girl
did
was
to
look
shyly
at
eliza
who
pursed
up
her
lips
and
did
her
best
to
keep
from
smiling
i
hear
answered
the
grim
hand
maiden
eliza
do
you
think
he
would
know
me
in
this
dress
or
if
so
would
he
like
it
as
he
did
that
dear
italian
costume
i
do
nt
know
answered
eliza
them
italians
have
queer
notions
about
dress
now
for
my
part
them
short
skirts
and
low
necked
waists
did
well
enough
for
common
sized
girls
but
you
re
too
tall
and
carry
your
head
too
high
for
anything
but
a
skirt
that
sweeps
out
and
puffs
up
like
that
still
i
shall
always
like
the
dear
old
costume
eliza
oh
what
a
happy
happy
life
madame
broke
up
when
she
sent
for
us
yes
i
suppose
so
you
seemed
to
enjoy
it
and
as
for
that
young
fellow
what
with
his
boating
on
the
river
his
shooting
birds
which
i
hate
on
the
hills
and
his
lessons
well
really
oh
eliza
shall
we
ever
be
so
happy
again
cried
the
girl
kindling
up
with
bright
memories
not
just
in
the
same
way
real
folks
never
are
but
i
suppose
people
have
a
pretty
equal
share
of
the
good
and
bad
things
of
life
as
they
go
along
now
i
have
nt
an
idea
but
that
the
young
fellow
thought
all
was
up
with
him
when
he
got
the
letter
you
left
at
the
house
i
should
not
wonder
said
caroline
and
her
bosom
began
to
heave
with
an
after
swell
of
the
indignation
which
had
stormed
it
when
she
left
italy
at
an
hour
s
notice
it
was
a
cruel
thing
i
never
will
forgive
you
or
mr
brown
a
few
hours
would
have
made
no
difference
and
he
was
coming
the
next
day
what
then
if
he
was
a
teacher
mr
brown
left
his
money
with
two
months
overpay
his
money
repeated
caroline
what
did
he
come
for
questioned
the
hand
maiden
sharply
eliza
you
shall
never
think
that
it
degrades
him
and
me
he
never
touched
he
never
thought
of
money
if
mr
brown
left
it
as
you
say
i
am
sure
he
felt
insulted
then
what
did
he
come
for
inquired
eliza
with
dry
emphasis
because
because
he
loved
me
and
could
not
live
without
seeing
me
because
i
i
loved
him
said
the
maid
but
caroline
had
broken
down
wholly
with
this
first
passionate
confession
the
poor
girl
sank
to
a
couch
flushed
all
over
with
such
shame
as
only
a
woman
of
fine
sensibilities
can
feel
for
that
of
which
she
has
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
at
all
oh
eliza
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
she
exclaimed
dropping
her
hands
and
revealing
a
face
of
crimson
wet
with
tears
i
never
meant
to
keep
it
from
it
and
you
did
nt
do
it
which
is
more
you
supposed
i
did
nt
know
men
may
be
blind
as
bats
they
usually
are
and
our
brown
is
worse
than
the
commonality
but
trust
an
old
maid
for
spying
out
a
love
secret
it
s
like
exploring
a
strange
land
for
her
you
know
lord
miss
carry
you
ca
nt
keep
a
secret
from
eliza
casey
but
then
why
should
you
is
nt
she
bound
to
be
your
staunch
friend
forever
and
ever
these
words
opened
a
new
source
of
anxiety
to
the
really
unhappy
girl
who
forgot
her
love
shame
and
plunged
at
once
into
a
new
subject
oh
eliza
if
you
could
help
me
madame
is
determined
that
is
she
wishes
me
to
go
on
the
stage
well
you
have
been
told
that
from
the
first
i
know
i
know
but
it
seemed
so
far
off
then
like
death
or
any
other
tell
when
but
now
she
says
it
must
be
at
once
oh
eliza
i
never
can
do
it
the
very
fear
of
it
makes
me
shudder
but
why
i
remember
when
we
first
came
out
here
you
had
no
other
wish
but
to
be
like
her
your
mother
i
mean
like
her
i
would
rather
see
you
dead
eliza
muttered
the
last
words
under
her
breath
and
caroline
only
heard
the
question
yes
i
know
everything
seemed
so
bright
then
she
brightest
of
all
but
i
was
getting
to
shrink
from
it
before
we
went
up
to
that
dear
little
villa
and
since
then
it
has
seemed
like
death
oh
tell
her
this
eliza
and
beg
of
her
to
let
me
be
as
i
am
but
shall
i
tell
her
all
and
say
that
is
the
reason
no
no
no
you
may
think
it
mr
brown
may
think
it
that
tell
her
a
moment
out
of
delicate
deference
to
their
host
who
came
up
panting
in
the
rear
p
r
aps
ye
d
better
hold
on
a
second
out
yer
whilst
i
go
in
and
see
thet
things
is
all
right
said
the
old
man
suggestion
was
graciously
accepted
the
door
opened
and
closed
on
the
host
and
the
crowd
leaning
their
backs
against
the
wall
and
cowering
under
the
eaves
waited
and
listened
for
a
few
moments
there
was
no
sound
but
the
dripping
of
water
from
the
eaves
and
the
stir
and
rustle
of
wrestling
boughs
above
them
then
the
men
became
uneasy
and
whispered
suggestion
and
suspicion
passed
from
the
one
to
the
other
reckon
she
s
caved
in
his
head
the
first
lick
decoyed
him
inter
the
tunnel
and
barred
him
up
likely
got
him
down
and
sittin
on
him
prob
ly
bilin
suthin
to
heave
on
us
stand
clear
the
door
boys
for
just
then
the
latch
clicked
the
door
slowly
opened
and
a
voice
said
come
in
out
o
the
wet
the
voice
was
neither
that
of
the
old
man
nor
of
his
wife
it
was
the
voice
of
a
small
boy
its
weak
treble
broken
by
premature
self
assertion
can
give
it
was
the
face
of
a
small
boy
that
looked
up
at
theirs
a
face
that
might
have
been
pretty
and
even
refined
but
that
it
was
darkened
by
evil
knowledge
from
within
and
dirt
and
hard
experience
from
without
he
had
a
blanket
around
his
shoulders
and
had
evidently
just
risen
from
his
bed
come
in
he
repeated
and
do
nt
make
no
noise
the
old
man
s
in
there
talking
to
mar
he
continued
pointing
to
an
adjacent
room
which
seemed
to
be
a
kitchen
from
which
the
old
man
s
voice
came
in
deprecating
accents
let
me
be
he
added
querulously
to
dick
bullen
who
had
caught
him
up
blanket
and
all
and
was
affecting
to
toss
him
into
the
fire
let
go
o
me
you
d
d
old
fool
d
ye
hear
thus
adjured
dick
bullen
lowered
johnny
to
the
ground
with
a
smothered
laugh
while
the
men
entering
quietly
occupied
the
centre
of
the
room
johnny
then
gravely
proceeded
to
a
cupboard
and
brought
out
several
articles
which
he
deposited
on
the
table
thar
s
whiskey
and
crackers
and
red
herons
and
cheese
he
took
a
bite
of
the
latter
on
his
way
to
the
table
and
sugar
he
scooped
up
a
mouthful
en
route
with
a
small
and
very
dirty
hand
and
terbacker
thar
s
dried
appils
too
on
the
shelf
but
i
do
nt
admire
em
appils
is
swellin

he
concluded
now
wade
in
and
do
nt
be
afeard
i
do
nt
mind
the
old
woman
she
do
nt
b
long
to
me
s
long
he
had
stepped
to
the
threshold
of
a
small
room
scarcely
larger
than
a
closet
partitioned
off
from
the
main
apartment
and
holding
in
its
dim
recess
a
small
bed
he
stood
there
a
moment
looking
at
the
company
his
bare
feet
peeping
from
the
blanket
and
nodded
to
turn
in
agin
are
ye
said
dick
yes
i
are
responded
johnny
decidedly
why
wot
s
up
old
fellow
i
m
sick
how
sick
i
ve
got
a
fevier
and
childblains
and
roomatiz
returned
johnny
and
vanished
within
after
a
moment
s
pause
he
added
in
the
dark
apparently
from
under
the
bedclothes
and
biles
there
was
an
embarrassing
silence
the
men
looked
at
each
other
and
at
the
fire
even
with
the
appetizing
banquet
before
them
it
seemed
as
if
they
might
again
fall
into
the
despondency
of
thompson
s
grocery
when
the
voice
of
the
old
man
incautiously
lifted
came
deprecatingly
from
the
kitchen
certainly
thet
s
so
in
course
they
is
a
gang
o
lazy
drunken
loafers
and
that
ar
dick
bullen
s
the
ornariest
of
all
did
nt
hev
no
more
sabe
than
to
come
thet
s
what
i
said
bullen
sez
i
it
s
crazy
drunk
you
are
or
a
fool
sez
i
to
think
o
such
a
thing

i
sez
be
you
a

my
roof
and
invalids
lyin
round
but
they
would
come
they
would
thet
s
wot
you
must
spect
o
such
trash
as
lays
round
the
bar
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
men
followed
this
unfortunate
exposure
whether
it
was
overheard
in
the
kitchen
or
whether
the
old
man
s
irate
companion
had
just
then
exhausted
all
other
modes
of
expressing
her
contemptuous
indignation
i
can
not
say
but
a
back
door
was
suddenly
slammed
with
great
violence
a
moment
later
and
the
old
man
reappeared
haply
unconscious
of
the
cause
of
the
late
hilarious
outburst
and
smiled
blandly
the
old
woman
thought
she
d
jest
run
over
to
mrs
mcfadden
with
jaunty
indifference
as
he
took
a
seat
at
the
board
oddly
enough
it
needed
this
untoward
incident
to
relieve
the
embarrassment
that
was
beginning
to
be
felt
by
the
party
and
their
natural
audacity
returned
with
their
host
i
do
not
propose
to
record
the
convivialities
of
that
evening
the
inquisitive
reader
will
accept
the
statement
that
the
conversation
was
characterized
by
the
same
intellectual
exaltation
the
same
cautious
reverence
the
same
fastidious
delicacy
the
same
rhetorical
precision
and
the
same
logical
and
coherent
discourse
somewhat
later
in
the
evening
which
distinguish
similar
gatherings

the
masculine
sex

civilized
localities

under

favorable
auspices

marry
without

without

without

to

and
suppose

uncle
should
be
unrelenting
and
give
him
nothing
and
even
decline
to
recommend
him
for
a
position
in
the
custom
house
he
knew
that
from
the
staid
and
severe
old
man
s
point
of
view
he
was
untrustworthy
and
unendorsable
and
little
less
than
of
belief
which
the
judge
held
to
be
inexorably
binding
and
tremendously
important
there
had
been
wild
orgies
in
his
life
in
paris
and
painful
scandals
in
his
life
in
new
york
and
a
sufficiently
accurate
report
of
these
excesses
had
reached
the
horrified
ears
of
his
relative
finally
and
here
was
another
terrible
charge
against
him
in
the
eyes
of
a
prudent
business
man
he
had
been
not
only
unwise
in
regard
to
the
concerns
of
the
other
world
but
reckless
in
the
affairs
of
this
investing
recklessly
and
utterly
wasting
his
substance
for
these
things
he
had
been
sternly
reproved
and
warned
that
severe
punishment
would
follow
on
continuance
in
evil
and
all
to
no
purpose
he
had
argued
with
lofty
flippancy
in
defence
of
his
ways
and
had
irritated
his
grave
and
conscientious
adviser
to
the
utmost
there
had
been
a
quarrel
the
uncle
had
ceased
to
invite
the
nephew
to
his
house
then
he
had
sent
for
his
more
distant
relatives
the
dinnefords
finally
it
was
supposed
that
he
not
credit
until
having
spent
or
lost
his
ultimate
dollar
he
fell
into
that
depression
of
spirit
which
poverty
brings
to
those
whom
it
visits
for
the
first
time
now
living
on
borrowed
money
he
did
fear
seriously
that
he
had
sold
his
birthright
for
departed
messes
of
pottage
as
he
mechanically
continued
his
light
labor
of
personal
adornment
he
meditated
on
the
pit
into
which
he
had
stumbled
and
on
the
chances
of
getting
out
of
it
if
he
should
reform
or
pretend
reformation
if
he
should
humble
himself
before
the
judge
and
lead
a
quiet
life
if
he
should
marry
this
daughter
of
a
missionary
no
doubt
a
pet
with
the
devout
master
of
sea
lodge
would
the
riches
which
had
taken
wings
fly
back
to
him
the
dead
beat
was
far
from
certain
of
it
and
no
wonder
that
his
fine
eyes
were
gloomy
well
wolverton
we
will
see
he
said
at
last
trying
to
puff
away
his
sorrows
with
a
sigh
i
do
nt
like
it
be
good
and
you
will
be
happy
but
you
wo
nt
have
a
good
time
now
i
want
a
good
time
still
it
seems
to
be
advisable
to
turn
a
corner
and
try
the
next
street
only
we
wo
nt
do
it
this
evening
let
s
get
up
some
fellows
and
be
jolly
there
are
no
fellows
here
i
suppose
replied
wolverton
none
of
our
fellows
i
saw
the
count
in
the
reading
room
as
we
came
up
stairs
what
count
there
are
so
many
counts
poloski
as
he
calls
himself
said
edward
ringing
the
bell
i
ll
have
him
up
chapter
x
a
gentleman
and
scholar
poloski
grumbled
wolverton
what
the
deuce
is
he
here
for
run
aground
on
the
bottom
of
his
purse
and
waiting
for
a
chance
to
gamble
i
suppose
what
do
you
want
him
up
for
i
something
in
blood
said
edward
remembering
with
more
than
the
pride
of
his
uncle
that
he
was
descended
from
many
recorded
wetherels
i
suppose
a
count
must
be
a
gentleman
in
some
one
point
of
his
character
if
you
can
only
discover
what
that
point
is
i
never
knew
one
in
this
country
who
could
be
trusted
asserted
wolverton
they
are
all
dead
beats
looking
out
for
a
rich
marriage
or
some
other
chance
to
swindle
somebody
and
to
the
best
of
my
travelling
observation
and
study
four
fifths
of
those
in
europe
are
no
better
poloski
at
any
rate
is
a
sucker
he
is
a
sponge
incarnate
you
need
nt
lend
him
anything
tell
him
you
have
passed
over
all
your
flush
to
me
come
let
s
have
him
in
he
is
such
a
confounded
blowhard
and
monkey
that
he
is
amusing
send
for
him
returned
wolverton
a
lazily
obliging
man
as
many
idle
people
are
on
the
despatched
him
in
search
of
the
distinguished
foreigner
tall
light
complexioned
fellow
he
explained
looks
a
little
like
me
perhaps
a
good
deal
i
would
nt
say
that
put
in
wolverton
when
the
servant
had
departed
it
s
a
resemblance
that
is
nt
recommendatory
i
do
nt
brag
of
it
laughed
the
young
man
but
i
have
been
taken
for
him
and
i
know
he
can
wear
my
clothes
borrowed
a
tiptop
suit
once
and
never
returned
it
fitted
him
like
a
glove
whenever
i
met
him
in
it
bowing
and
grimacing
in
his
ridiculous
style
i
felt
like
saying
how
are
you
you
jackanapes
of
a
wetherel
and
what
are
you
cutting
up
those
monkey
shines
for
presently
the
noble
guest
of
american
entered
the
room
he
was
certainly
very
like
wetherel
he
had
the
same
fair
skin
and
hair
the
same
resolute
blue
eyes
and
prominent
chin
the
same
height
and
slenderness
age
although
he
was
in
reality
several
years
older
the
resemblance
between
the
two
men
did
not
however
extend
to
expression
and
manner
poloski
s
expression
was
against
him
it
had
unpleasant
gleams
of
furtiveness
and
dexterity
it
suggested
a
man
who
lives
by
his
wits
in
gesture
and
style
of
speaking
he
was
more
graceful
and
animated
than
the
young
american
or
than
americans
in
general
nor
was
it
quite
just
to
accuse
him
of
monkey
shines
his
address
though
lively
was
human
enough
and
fairly
agreeable
his
accent
in
english
was
nearly
perfect
which
i
believe
is
not
a
wonderful
thing
in
a
pole
how
do
wolverton
how
do
wetherel
he
said
in
rapid
cheerful
pleasant
tone
at
the
same
time
showing
his
teeth
cordially
so
glad
to
find
you
here
what
a
dull
place
this
the
line
but
the
boys
seldom
came
back
from
an
excursion
to
canada
without
adventures
to
keep
the
family
laughing
for
a
week
and
they
made
it
a
serious
business
to
study
the
comic
points
of
their
beneficiaries
who
severally
lived
in
the
family
records
by
some
grotesque
mental
or
physical
trait
they
had
an
irreverent
name
among
themselves
for
each
of
the
humorless
abolition
lecturers
who
unfailingly
abode
with
them
on
their
rounds
and
these
brethren
and
sisters
as
they
calle
them
paid
with
whatever
was
laughable
in
them
for
the
substantial
favors
they
received
miss
kitty
having
the
same
natural
bent
began
even
as
a
child
to
share
in
these
harmless
reprisals
and
to
look
at
life
with
the
same
wholesomely
fantastic
vision
but
she
remembered
one
abolition
visitor
of
whom
none
of
them
made
fun
but
treated
with
a
serious
distinction
narrow
forehead
and
thereon
a
thick
upright
growth
of
gray
hair
who
looked
at
her
from
under
bushy
brows
with
eyes
as
of
blue
flame
and
took
her
on
his
knee
one
night
and
sang
to
her
blow
ye
the
trumpet
blow
he
and
her
uncle
had
been
talking
of
some
indefinite
far
off
place
that
they
called
boston
in
terms
that
commended
it
to
her
childish
apprehension
as
very
little
less
holy
than
jerusalem
and
as
the
home
of
all
the
good
and
great
people
outside
of
palestine
in
fact
boston
had
always
been
dr
ellison
s
foible
in
the
beginning
of
the
great
antislavery
agitation
he
had
exchanged
letters
corresponded
he
used
to
say
with
john
quincy
adams
on
the
subject
of
lovejoy
s
murder
and
he
had
met
several
boston
men
at
the
free
soil
convention
in
buffalo
in
a
little
formal
perhaps
a
little
reserved
he
would
say
but
excellent
men
polished
and
certainly
of
sterling
principle
they
grew
older
and
sometimes
provoke
them
to
highly
colored
dramatizations
of
the
formality
of
these
bostonians
in
meeting
their
father
the
years
passed
and
the
boys
went
west
and
when
the
war
came
they
took
service
in
iowa
and
wisconsin
regiments
by
and
by
the
president
s
proclamation
of
freedom
to
the
slaves
reached
eriecreek
while
dick
and
bob
happened
both
to
be
home
on
leave
after
they
had
allowed
their
sire
his
rapture
well
this
is
a
great
blow
for
father
said
bob
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
father
fugitive
slavery
and
all
its
charms
blotted
out
forever
at
one
fell
swoop
pretty
rough

no
more
men
and

no
more
soulless
oligarchy

lookout
father
o
no
insinuated
one
of
the
girls
there
s
boston
why
yes
cried
dick
to
be
sure
there
is
the
president
has
nt
abolished
boston
live
for
ideal
boston
thereafter
so
far
at
least
as
concerned
a
never
relinquished
never
fulfilled
purpose
of
some
day
making
a
journey
to
boston
but
in
the
mean
time
there
were
other
things
and
at
present
since
the
proclamation
had
given
him
a
country
worth
living
in
he
was
ready
to
honor
her
by
studying
her
antiquities
in
his
youth
before
his
mind
had
been
turned
so
strenuously
to
the
consideration
of
slavery
he
had
a
pretty
taste
for
the
mystery
of
the
mound
builders
and
each
of
his
boys
now
returned
to
camp
with
instructions
to
note
any
phenomena
that
would
throw
light
upon
this
interesting
subject
they
would
have
abundant
leisure
for
research
since
the
proclamation
dr
ellison
insisted
practically
ended
the
war
the
mound
builders
were
only
a
starting
point
for
the
doctor
he
advanced
from
them
to
historical
times
in
due
course
and
it
happened
that
when
colonel
ellison
and
his
wife
stopped
off
at
erie
creek
on
their
way
east
in
they
found
him
deep
in
the
history
of
the
intended
to
take
the
canadian
route
eastward
and
he
escaped
without
the
charges
which
he
must
otherwise
have
received
to
look
up
the
points
of
interest
at
montreal
and
quebec
connected
with
that
ancient
struggle
he
and
his
wife
carried
kitty
with
them
to
see
niagara
which
she
had
never
seen
because
it
was
so
near
but
no
sooner
had
dr
ellison
got
the
despatch
announcing
that
they
would
take
kitty
on
with
them
down
the
st
lawrence
to
quebec
and
bring
her
home
by
way
of
boston
than
he
sat
down
and
wrote
her
a
letter
of
the
most
comprehensive
character
as
far
as
concerned
canada
his
mind
was
purely
historical
but
when
it
came
to
boston
it
was
strangely
re
abolitionized
and
amidst
an
ardor
for
the
antiquities
of
the
place
his
old
love
for
its
humanitarian
pre
eminence
blazed
up
he
would
have
her
visit
faneuil
hall
because
of
its
revolutionary
memories
but
not
less
because
wendell
phillips
had
there
made
his
first
antislavery
speech
she
was
to
see
the
collections
of
the
massachusetts
historical
society
which
he
named
but
at
any
rate
she
was
somehow
to
catch
sight
of
the
author
of
the
biglow
papers
of
senator
sumner
of
mr
whittier
of
dr
howe
of
colonel
higginson
and
of
mr
garrison
these
people
were
all
bostonians
to
the
idealizing
remoteness
of
dr
ellison
and
he
could
not
well
conceive
of
them
asunder
he
perhaps
imagined
that
kitty
was
more
likely
to
see
them
together
than
separately
and
perhaps
indeed
they
were
less
actual
persons
to
his
admiration
than
so
many
figures
of
a
grand
historical
composition
finally
i
want
you
to
remember
my
dear
child
he
wrote
that
in
boston
you
are
not
only
in
the
birthplace
of
american
liberty
but
the
yet
holier
scene
of
its
resurrection
there
everything
that
is
noble
and
grand
and
liberal
and
enlightened
in
the
national
life
has
originated
and
i
can
not
doubt
that
you
will
find
the
character
of
its
people
marked
by
every
attribute
of
a
magnanimous
democracy
if
i
could
envy
you
this
privilege
of
seeing
a
city
where
man
is
valued
simply
and
solely
for
what
he
is
in
himself
and
where
color
wealth
which
he
waited
for
the
evening
he
wished
to
see
madame
de
mauves
for
the
last
time
at
the
hour
of
long
shadows
and
pale
reflected
amber
lights
as
he
had
almost
always
seen
her
destiny
however
took
no
account
of
this
humble
plea
for
seated
by
the
great
walk
under
a
tree
and
alone
the
hour
made
the
place
almost
empty
the
day
was
warm
but
as
he
took
his
place
beside
her
a
light
breeze
stirred
the
leafy
edges
of
their
broad
circle
of
shadow
she
looked
at
him
almost
with
no
pretence
of
not
having
believed
herself
already
rid
of
him
and
he
at
once
told
her
that
he
should
leave
saint
germain
that
evening
but
must
first
bid
her
farewell
her
face
lighted
a
moment
he
fancied
as
he
spoke
but
she
said
nothing
only
turning
it
off
to
far
paris
which
lay
twinkling
and
flashing
through
hot
exhalations
i
ve
a
request
to
make
of
you
he
added
that
you
think
of
me
as
a
man
who
has
felt
much
and
claimed
little
she
drew
a
long
breath
which
almost
suggested
pain
i
ca
nt
think
of
you
as
unhappy
that
s
impossible
you
ve
a
life
to
lead
you
ve
duties
talents
inspirations
interests
she
pursued
after
a
pause
though
as
if
it
had
before
this
quite
been
settled
between
them
one
ca
nt
be
unhappy
through
having
a
better
opinion
of
a
friend
instead
of
a
worse
for
a
moment
he
failed
to
understand
her
do
you
mean
that
there
can
be
varying
degrees
in
my
opinion
of
you
she
rose
and
pushed
away
her
chair
i
mean
she
said
quickly
that
it
s
better
to
have
done
nothing
in
bitterness
nothing
in
passion
and
she
began
to
walk
longmore
followed
her
without
answering
at
first
but
he
took
off
his
hat
and
with
his
pocket
handkerchief
wiped
his
forehead
where
shall
you
go
what
shall
you
do
he
simply
asked
at
last
do
i
shall
do
as
i
ve
always
done
except
perhaps
that
i
shall
go
for
a
while
to
my
husband
s
old
home
i
shall
go
to
my
old
one
i
ve
done
with
europe
for
glanced
at
him
as
he
walked
beside
her
after
he
had
spoken
these
words
and
then
bent
her
eyes
for
a
long
time
on
the
ground
but
suddenly
as
if
aware
of
her
going
too
far
she
stopped
and
put
out
her
hand
good
bye
may
you
have
all
the
happiness
you
deserve
he
took
her
hand
with
his
eyes
on
her
but
something
was
at
work
in
him
that
made
it
impossible
to
deal
in
the
easy
way
with
her
touch
something
of
infinite
value
was
floating
past
him
and
he
had
taken
an
oath
with
which
any
such
case
interfered
not
to
raise
a
finger
to
stop
it
it
was
borne
by
the
strong
current
of
the
world
s
great
life
and
not
of
his
own
small
one
madame
de
mauves
disengaged
herself
gathered
in
her
long
scarf
and
smiled
at
him
almost
as
you
would
do
at
a
child
you
should
wish
to
encourage
several
moments
later
he
was
still
there
watching
her
leave
him
and
leave
him
when
she
once
back
to
his
hotel
and
without
waiting
for
the
evening
train
paid
his
bill
and
departed
later
in
the
day
m
de
mauves
came
into
his
wife
s
drawing
room
where
she
sat
waiting
to
be
summoned
to
dinner
he
had
dressed
as
he
usually
did
nt
dress
for
dining
at
home
he
walked
up
and
down
for
some
moments
in
silence
then
rang
the
bell
for
a
servant
and
went
out
into
the
hall
to
meet
him
he
ordered
the
carriage
to
take
him
to
the
station
paused
a
moment
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
dismissed
the
servant
angrily
as
the
latter
lingered
observing
him
re
entered
the
drawing
room
resumed
his
restless
walk
and
at
last
stopped
abruptly
before
his
wife
who
had
taken
up
a
book
may
i
ask
the
favour
he
said
with
evident
effort
in
spite
of
a
forced
smile
as
of
allusion
to
a
large
past
exercise
of
the
very
best
taste
of
having
a
question
answered
it
s
very
true
do
you
expect
this
evening
a
visit
from
mr
longmore
mr
longmore
said
his
wife
has
left
saint
germain
m
de
mauves
waited
but
his
smile
expired
mr
longmore
his
wife
continued
has
gone
to
america
m
de
mauves
took
it
a
rare
thing
for
him
with
confessed
if
momentary
intellectual
indigence
but
he
raised
as
it
were
the
wind
has
anything
happened
he
asked
had
he
a
sudden
call
but
his
question
received
no
answer
at
the
same
moment
the
servant
threw
open
the
door
and
announced
dinner
madame
clairin
rustled
in
rubbing
her
white
hands
madame
de
mauves
passed
silently
into
the
dining
room
but
he
remained
outside
outside
of
more
things
clearly
than
his
mere
salle
a
manger
before
long
he
went
forth
to
the
terrace
and
continued
his
uneasy
walk
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
servant
came
to
let
send
it
away
he
said
without
hesitation
i
sha
nt
use
it
when
the
ladies
had
half
finished
dinner
he
returned
and
joined
them
with
a
formal
apology
to
his
wife
for
his
inconsequence
the
dishes
were
brought
back
but
he
hardly
tasted
them
he
drank
on
the
other
hand
more
wine
than
usual
there
was
little
talk
scarcely
a
convivial
sound
save
the
occasional
expressive
appreciative
m
m
m
of
madame
clairin
over
the
succulence
of
some
dish
twice
this
lady
saw
her
brother
s
eyes
fixed
on
her
own
over
his
wineglass
put
to
her
a
question
she
knew
she
should
have
to
irritate
him
later
on
by
not
being
able
to
answer
she
replied
for
the
present
at
least
by
an
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
that
resembled
even
to
her
own
humour
the
vain
raising
of
an
madagascar
oh
isabel
you
must
not
go
oh
please
please
she
said
coaxingly
oh
wo
nt
you
please
tell
him
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
and
would
rather
stay
with
us
oh
but
you
know
i
promised
amy
but
you
sha
nt
go
tell
him
you
wo
nt
she
threw
her
arms
round
isabel
s
neck
but
do
nt
you
think
that
it
is
very
selfish
of
little
amy
to
wish
that
her
brother
should
go
alone
to
that
far
country
when
she
will
have
papa
mamma
and
sisters
oh
i
wish
you
did
nt
love
him
one
bit
and
then
you
would
stay
with
us
hush
amy
dear
you
must
nt
talk
so
but
i
ca
nt
help
wishing
it
and
i
told
everard
so
and
that
i
hoped
you
would
change
your
mind
then
he
said
that
it
was
very
wicked
of
me
to
wish
that
and
he
put
me
off
his
knee
so
quick
and
walked
out
of
the
room
looking
so
angry
no
not
angry
exactly
but
as
if
he
thought
perhaps
you
might
but
amy
if
you
loved
any
one
very
much
would
you
like
it
if
that
person
did
nt
love
you
one
bit
no
it
doing
as
you
would
be
done
by
to
wish
such
unkind
and
selfish
things
i
did
not
think
of
that
replied
amy
resting
her
head
on
isabel
s
shoulder
but
it
seems
as
if
you
did
not
love
me
to
go
away
to
madagascar
she
added
sadly
oh
amy
dear
i
love
you
very
much
said
isabel
the
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
and
it
grieves
me
to
part
from
you
and
then
we
shall
have
another
horrid
governess
like
miss
manning
and
the
days
will
all
be
long
and
miserable
like
the
long
long
weary
day
that
emily
used
to
sing
about
and
what
will
become
of
all
our
nice
sundays
poor
little
amy
said
isabel
parting
back
the
shining
curls
from
the
sorrowful
little
face
and
looking
into
the
violet
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
her
so
earnestly
you
must
not
think
that
i
would
leave
you
without
first
you
and
try
to
make
you
happy
now
if
you
will
stop
crying
i
will
tell
you
about
the
young
lady
who
i
hope
will
be
your
governess
she
is
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
and
i
trust
you
will
all
be
very
kind
to
her
and
love
her
very
much
her
name
is
gertrude
hartley
alice
and
rose
now
entered
the
school
room
and
gave
a
very
warm
welcome
to
isabel
please
go
on
about
gertrude
hartley
pleaded
amy
then
isabel
told
them
how
gertrude
had
gone
as
a
governess
to
a
family
who
lived
far
back
in
the
country
miles
away
from
any
church
and
how
by
her
endeavors
a
small
but
pretty
one
had
been
erected
where
service
was
held
once
a
month
but
gertrude
had
grown
tired
of
the
country
and
was
anxious
to
obtain
another
situation
she
will
come
to
see
you
next
week
and
i
am
sure
you
will
like
her
and
you
know
you
can
often
i
shall
write
you
nice
long
letters
about
that
strange
country
and
i
shall
often
think
of
my
dear
little
sisters
for
you
will
be
my
sisters
then
you
know
i
did
not
think
of
that
said
amy
smiling
oh
isabel
i
m
so
sorry
that
you
are
going
away
do
nt
you
think
you
could
persuade
everard
to
give
up
being
a
missionary
i
m
certain
he
could
have
attwood
church
if
he
liked
because
dr
herbert
once
asked
him
if
he
would
like
it
please
do
because
it
would
be
so
nice
what
and
leave
those
heathen
people
still
in
ignorance
of
god
my
little
rose
does
not
think
what
she
is
wishing
that
everard
would
give
up
no
i
could
not
wish
him
to
do
so
much
less
persuade
him
but
he
might
get
some
one
else
to
go
replied
rose
no
rose
we
must
each
perform
our
own
duties
hand
to
the
plow
and
looking
back
exactly
so
replied
isabel
i
did
not
think
of
it
in
that
way
so
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
i
was
not
angry
dear
only
i
wanted
to
show
you
that
your
wish
was
a
wrong
one
what
does
alice
think
about
it
i
think
replied
alice
that
he
ought
to
go
and
i
am
very
glad
that
you
are
going
with
him
for
you
are
so
nice
and
so
good
that
i
am
sure
the
little
heathen
children
will
listen
to
what
you
say
because
you
have
such
a
nice
way
of
telling
things
of
course
i
am
very
sorry
to
lose
you
but
i
mean
to
think
of
the
good
your
going
will
be
for
other
people
and
how
nice
it
is
for
everard
and
then
i
shall
not
care
about
it
so
much
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
hear
you
say
this
and
i
think
that
dear
children
that
the
surest
way
to
forget
our
own
troubles
is
to
find
pleasure
in
the
benefit
and
happiness
of
others
everard
arlington
was
about
to
enter
by
the
window
but
paused
a
moment
to
contemplate
the
group
before
him
on
a
large
ottoman
sat
isabel
with
amy
on
her
knee
one
arm
encircling
alice
who
was
standing
thoughtfully
by
her
side
her
head
resting
on
isabel
s
shoulder
while
behind
was
rose
half
smiles
half
tears
oh
everard
cried
amy
i
wo
nt
say
again
that
i
hope
isabel
will
not
go
with
you
but
she
says
that
it
is
not
naughty
to
be
sorry
you
are
not
angry
with
me
now
she
inquired
looking
wistfully
into
his
face
no
my
little
amy
he
replied
smoothing
the
glossy
curls
as
he
stooped
as
if
to
kiss
her
but
he
did
nt
kiss
amy

do
things
by

daughter
