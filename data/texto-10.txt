you
come

away
at

hundred
dollars

you

tell
you
about
it
i

that
you

ahead
for
this
business
off
six
months

you
could
be
practicing
our

at

almost
as
big
as

one
there
are
lots
of
servants
and
a
great
weary
maze
of
accounts
to
be
kept
and
it
would
nt
be

practice
for
you
now
would
it

lit
up
no
you
are

there

side

it

so
attractive
that

s
wrath
and
risen
to
find
it
unabated
with
condensed
disapprobation
written
on
every
well
cut
feature
she
came
to
the
coldly
gleaming
breakfast
table
that
mrs
halsey
was
undoubtedly
gone
she
had
to
admit
yet
so
far
failed
to
find
the
exact
words
of
reproof
for
a
woman
of
independent
means
discharging
her
own
housekeeper
when
it
pleased
her
young
mathew
unexpectedly
appeared
at
breakfast
perhaps
in
anticipation
of
a
sort
of
roman
holiday
in
which
his
usually
late
and
apologetic
stepmother
would
furnish
the
amusement
they
were
both
surprised
to
find
her
there
before
them
looking
uncommonly
fresh
in
crisp
sheer
white
with
deep
toned
violets
in
her
belt
she
ate
with
every
appearance
of
enjoyment
chatting
amiably
about
the
lovely
morning
efforts
ill
seconded
however
shall
i
attend
to
the
orders
this
morning
asked
madam
weatherstone
with
an
air
of
noble
patience
o
no
thank
you
replied
viva
i
have
engaged
a
new
housekeeper
a
new
housekeeper
when
the
old
lady
was
shaken
by
this
inconceivable
promptness
last
night
said
her
daughter
in
law
looking
calmly
across
the
table
her
color
rising
a
little
and
when
is
she
coming
if
i
may
ask
she
has
come
i
have
been
with
her
an
hour
already
this
morning
young
mathew
smiled
this
was
amusing
though
not
what
he
had
expected
how
extremely
alert
and
businesslike
he
said
lazily
it
s
becoming
to
you
to
get
up
early
you
ca
nt
have
got
much
of
a
person
at
a
minute
s
notice
said
his
grandmother
or
perhaps
you
have
been
planning
this
for
some
time
wanted
to
get
rid
of
mrs
halsey
for
some
time
but
the
new
one
i
found
yesterday
what
s
her
name
inquired
mathew
bell
miss
diantha
bell
she
answered
looking
as
calm
as
if
announcing
the
day
of
the
week
but
inwardly
dreading
the
result
somewhat
like
most
of
such
terrors
it
was
overestimated
there
was
a
little
pause
rather
an
intense
little
pause
and
then
is
nt
that
the
girl
who
set
em
all
by
the
ears
yesterday
asked
the
young
man
pointing
to
the
morning
paper
they
say
she
all
that
parade
yesterday
the
man
or
woman
who
attempts
to
get
pleasure
out
of
sitting
in
a
finer
seat
or
living
in
a
finer
house
or
wearing
finer
duds
than
his
neighbor
or
even
his
enemy
will
miss
it
unless
he
is
of
a
low
order
and
taste
when
i
saw
all
them
good
folks
gaping
and
staring
at
me
like
i
was
a
comet
with
a
tail
right
there
in
the
house
of
god
while
a
good
man
was
teaching
humility
and
prayers
and
songs
was
going
up
to
the
throne
i
say
while
all
that
was
taking
place
i
felt
like
a
cheat
and
a
swindler
hiding
under
plumes
clap
trap
flowers
and
flounces
that
ud
fade
i
looked
across
and
saw
carrie
poor
carrie
with
that
blank
stare
of
death
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
say
you
ve
whipped
me
clean
to
the
earth
dix
i
m
done
i
m
all
how
awful
it
is
she
may
have
thought
i
was
crowing
over
her
but
i
wasnt
god
knows
i
was
nt
during
the
first
prayer
i
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
her
and
begged
forgiveness
for
my
silly
caper
the
poor
thing
has
lost
even
her
boy
lover
she
s
yearning
for
something
she
may
never
lay
her
hands
on
as
god
is
my
judge
if
i
could
give
her
this
man
that
was
here
yesterday
i
d
do
it
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
alfred
i
do
nt
want
him
nohow
i
thought
i
might
come
round
to
it
but
every
word
he
says
every
move
he
makes
goes
against
me
if
i
tied
myself
to
a
man
like
that
it
would
be
one
continual
fight
to
approve
of
him
oh
he
was
so
puffed
up
yesterday
that
i
wanted
to
pull
his
ears
and
make
him
see
straight
talking
all
the
time
about
the
dash
we
d
cut
and
the
attention
we
attracted
i
was
guilty
of
the
crime
and
wanted
to
about
well
that
is
except
one
other
thing
one
other
thing
henley
echoed
yes
it
was
marry
marry
marry
wife
wife
wife
even
before
the
home
folks
he
could
nt
put
a
bite
of
my
cooking
in
his
big
red
mouth
without
saying
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
to
come
to
a
table
loaded
that
way
three
times
a
day
i
say
i
had
to
laugh
there
i
was
figuring
on
using
him
to
the
end
that
i
could
set
back
in
a
rocking
chair
and
fan
myself
and
tell
a
nigger
cook
to
rake
any
old
scraps
together
and
not
bother
me
with
the
details
while
he
saw
me
with
my
sleeves
rolled
up
humped
over
a
hot
stove
or
in
a
cloud
of
steam
at
a
wash
tub
he
said
he
could
pay
me
the
compliment
of
being
the
only
girl
who
loved
hard
work
as
much
as
his
mother
had
till
it
killed
her
loved
it
mind
you
think
of
drudging
all
your
life
for
a
man
that
favor
by
keeping
it
piled
up
around
you
while
he
was
lying
around
a
store
telling
a
bunch
of
clerks
what
to
do
and
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
time
to
eat
yes
i
felt
mean
all
through
the
service
and
after
he
left
little
joe
sneaked
over
after
dark
to
get
me
to
teach
him
his
geography
and
while
i
was
doing
it
i
put
my
arm
around
his
poor
little
wasted
neck
and
hugged
him
he
looked
up
and
begun
to
cry
and
kissed
me
alfred
there
ai
nt
no
mistaking
the
article
when
you
run
across
it
it
is
real
love
i
have
for
that
boy
the
love
of
a
mother
for
her
child
that
is
suffering
i
went
as
far
with
him
as
the
fence
and
as
me
and
him
stood
together
in
the
starlight
i
felt
somehow
that
there
was
just
one
thing
standing
between
me
and
god
and
that
was
the
unworthy
thing
i
had
been
doing
that
day
i
am
thankful
for
my
burdens
for
i
have
for
joe
shows
what
the
other
love
ought
to
be
like
and
until
i
yearn
to
help
a
man

him
and

him
by
me
every
minute
until
then
i
ll
not
sell
myself
you

for
pay
and
be
honest
for
you
know
you
ca
nt
give
value
for
value
you
d
have
to
act
a
part
and
that
would
be
a
living
lie
that
would
pall
on
you
and
sicken
your
very
soul

out
of
himself
by
her
winsome
logic
yes
he
s
coming
sunday
i
ll
get
through
the
day
in
some
fashion
or
other
but
i
m
not
going
to
tole
im
along
like
a
pig
following
an
ear
of
corn
some
girls
would
whether
they
intended
to
take
him
or
not
but
i
ve
been
through
the
rubs
and
ca
nt
afford
to
be
so
silly
my
natural
pride
wo
nt
for
folks
would
say
he
turned
me
down
and
with
all
my
good
intentions
i
ca
nt
stand
that
i
do
nt
know
why
but
i
ca
nt
i
reckon
we
want
what
is
ours
if
it
is
as
empty
as
a
bottle
full
of
wind
and
in
the
fellow
s
way
he
does
want
me
a
girl
can
be
an
old
maid
with
much
more
content
if
she
s
had
what
the
world
would
call
a
solid
chance
when
he
had
left
her
and
was
walking
down
the
road
henley
paused
and
looked
back
and
saw
her
making
her
way
homeward
through
her
cotton
field
i
might
have
known
she
d
kick
him
he
said
tenderly
no
man
alive
is
worthy
of
her
no
man
ever
could
be
she
s
a
jewel
dropped
from
the
skies
she
is
as
sweet
and
innocent
as
a
baby
and
as
strong
and
brave
as
a
live
but
just
now
i
ca
nt
do
it
i
ve
got
all
i
can
do
to
instruct
myself
just
one
thing
more
i
owe
two
or
three
of
you
here
i
ve
got
the
money
for
william
bacon
james
bartlett
and
john
jennings
i
turn
the
mare
and
cutter
over
to
jacob
bensen
for
the
note
he
holds
i
hai
nt
got
much
religion
left
but
i
ve
got
some
morality
that
s
all
i
want
to
say
now
when
he
sat
down
there
was
a
profound
hush
then
bacon
arose
that
s
man
s
talk
that
is
an
i
jest
want
o
say
andrew
pill
that
you
kin
jest
forgit
you
owe
me
anything
an
if
ye
want
any
help
come

n
i
m
ready
to
give
ye
my
support
that
s
the
talk
said
councill
i
m
with
ye
on
that
pill
shook
his
head
the
painful
silence
which
followed
was
broken
by
the
effusive
voice
of
wheat
let
us
pray
and
remember
our
lost
brother
the
urgings
of
the
people
were
of
no
avail
mr
pill
settled
up
his
affairs
and
moved
to
cresco
where
he
went
back
into
trade
with
a
friend
and
for
three
years
attended
silently
to
his
customers
lived
down
their
curiosity
and
studied
anew
the
problem
of
life
then
he
moved
away
and
no
one
knew
whither
one
day
last
year
bacon
met
jennings
on
the
road
heerd
anything
o
pill
lately
no
have
you
waal
yes
brown
told
me
he
ran
acrost

what
jedge

me
built
a
new
church

it
twice
a
sunday
i
d
like
to
hear
him
but
he
s
got
t
be
too
big
a
gun
f
r
us
ben
studyun
they
say
went
t
school
jennings
drove
sadly
and
thoughtfully
on
rather
stumps
brother
jennings
laughed
bacon
in
a
good
humored
growl
a
day
of
grace
sunday
is
the
day
for
courtship
on
the
prairie
it
has
also
the
piety
of
cleanliness
it
allows
the
young
man
to
get
back
to
a
self
respecting
sweetness
of
person
and
enables
the
girls
to
look
as
nature
intended
dainty
and
sweet
as
posies
the
change
from
everyday
clothing
on
the
part
of
young
workmen
like
ben
griswold
was
more
than
change
it
approached
transformation
it
took
more
than
courage
to
go
through
the
change
it
required
love
ben
arose
a
little
later
on
sunday
morning
than
on
weekdays
the
horses
must
be
watered
fed
and
curried
and
the
cows
were
to
milk
but
after
breakfast
ben
threw
off
the
cares
of
the
hired
hand
when
he
came
down
from
the
little
garret
into
which
the
hot
august
sun
streamed
redly
he
was
a
changed
creature
clean
from
tip
to
toe
newly
shaven
wearing
a
crackling
white
shirt
a
linen
collar
and
a
new
suit
of
store
clothes
he
felt
himself
a
man
again
fit
to
meet
maidens
his
partner
being
a
married
man
was
slouching
around
in
his
tattered
and
greasy
brown
denim
overalls
he
looked
at
ben
and
grinned
got
a
tag
on
y
rself
no
why
nobod
y
know
ye
if
anything
happened
on
the
road
there
s
thirty
dollars
gone
to
the
dogs
he
sighed
oh
well
you
ll
get
over
that
just
as
i
did
i
hope
i
wo
nt
get
over
liking
to
be
clean
ben
said
to
milk
did
nt
expect
ye
that
s
the
very
time
o
day
the
girls
are
purtiest
just
about
sundown
better
take
rock
i
may
want
the
old
team
myself
ben
hitched
up
and
drove
off
in
the
warm
bright
morning
with
wonderful
elation
clean
and
self
respecting
once
more
his
freshly
shaven
face
felt
cool
and
his
new
suit
fitted
him
well
his
heart
took
on
a
great
resolution
which
was
to
call
upon
grace
the
thought
of
her
made
his
brown
hands
shake
and
he
remembered
how
many
times
he
had
sworn
to
visit
her
but
had
failed
of
courage
though
it
seemed
she
had
invited
him
by
word
and
look
to
do
so
he
overtook
milton
jennings
on
his
way
along
the
poplar
lined
lane
hello
milt
where
you
bound
milton
glanced
up
with
a
curious
look
in
his
laughing
eyes
from
the
pockets
of
his
long
linen
duster
he
drew
a
handful
of
beautiful
scarlet
and
yellow
siberian
crab
apples
em
milton
drew
a
similar
handful
out
of
his
left
pocket
see
those
what
y
going
to
do
with
em
take
em
home
again
something
in
milton
s
voice
led
him
to
ask
soberly
what
did
you
intend
doing
with
em
present
em
to
miss
cole
well
why
did
nt
y
do
it
milton
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
smile
that
was
frankly
derisive
of
himself
well
when
i
got
over
there
i
found
young
conley
s
sorrel
hitched
to
one
post
and
walt
brown
s
gray
hitched
to
the
other
i
went
in
but
i
did
nt
stay
long
in
fact
i
did
nt
sit
down
i
was
afraid
those
infernal
apples
would
roll
out
o
my
pockets
i
was
afraid
they
d
find
out
i
brought
em
over
there
for
miss
cole
like
the
darn
fool
i
was
they
both
laughed
heartily
one
else
that
s
tough
said
ben
but
climb
in
and
let
s
go
to
sunday
school
milton
got
in
and
they
ate
the
apples
as
they
rode
along
the
grove
schoolhouse
was
the
largest
in
the
township
and
was
the
only
one
with
a
touch
of
redeeming
grace
it
was
in
a
lovely
spot
great
oaks
stood
all
about
and
back
of
it
the
woods
grew
thick
and
a
clear
creek
gurgled
over
its
limestone
bed
not
far
away
to
ben
and
milton
there
was
a
wondrous
charm
about
the
grove
schoolhouse
it
was
the
one
place
where
the
boys
and
girls
met
in
garments
disassociated
from
toil
sundays
love
for
love
and
given
in
love
to
rest
and
silence
she
was
as
one
you
have
known
as
many
whom
others
know
now
tell
me
is
she
not
beautiful
i
saw
standing
before
me
the
figure
of
the
princess
tall
and
slender
and
very
beautiful
and
now
the
grave
garments
were
not
seen
for
her
robe
was
of
silk
new
and
soft
and
shapely
like
to
herself
and
her
arms
were
round
and
soft
and
her
eyes
were
full
and
dark
and
her
hair
was
as
deep
shadows
a
band
of
gold
was
about
her
brow
and
her
cheek
was
red
and
tender
in
its
bloom
her
neck
was
white
and
round
and
her
hands
were
white
and
her
slender
fingers
curved
slightly
as
her
arms
hung
down
by
her
sides
her
feet
were
small
and
straight
and
all
all
of
her
was
beautiful
and
she
was
a
princess
illustration
now
as
i
gazed
i
saw
the
face
and
saw
long
so
then
i
knew
that
the
princess
who
was
placed
away
for
rest
and
silence
had
never
died
for
did
she
not
stand
here
before
me
and
had
i
not
long
known
her
thus
ah
beautiful
i
took
up
these
small
golden
shoes
in
my
hands
and
held
them
out
to
her
take
these
little
shoes
i
said
wrought
as
cunning
as
man
may
know
place
them
upon
thy
feet
for
me
and
may
never
thorn
assail
thee
in
all
thy
going
wear
them
and
tread
the
steps
of
thrones
years
and
years
ages
and
ages
princess
beloved
see
they
are
wrought
in
love
now
i
saw
upon
the
lips
of
the
princess
who
had
lain
down
thousands
of
years
ago
but
who
lives
in
a
place
i
know
to
day
a
smile
very
faint
and
far
away
so
as
the
singing
mouse
told
me
it
was
to
be
seen
that
she
did
not
die
even
as
she
faded
away
from
the
i
wept
that
the
princess
was
not
dead
and
would
not
die
she
was
beautiful
she
was
beloved
and
these
things
have
not
died
ah
beautiful
i
said
to
the
singing
mouse
but
alas
for
a
princess
there
should
be
a
palace
and
here
is
none
look
about
you
said
the
singing
mouse
see
for
the
time
this
is
a
palace
i
looked
about
me
and
it
was
as
the
singing
mouse
said
for
the
time
my
room
was
a
palace
i
saw
standing
there
again
the
princess
upon
her
feet
small
golden
shoes
what
is
this
i
asked
and
who
am
i
but
as
i
turned
i
saw
that
the
singing
mouse
was
gone
but
this
i
knew
and
so
may
you
know
that
love
does
not
die
and
here
was
proof
of
it

once
said
of
a
little
stream
grasses
grew
all
about
and
small
plants
and
flowers
beyond
the
shores
of
the
little
stream
arose
a
forest
wide
and
dark
into
which
the
eye
could
reach
but
a
little
way
as
i
stood
near
the
little
stream
there
arose
from
the
grass
and
flowers
two
small
moths
soft
and
dainty
beautiful
and
very
white
covered
also
with
a
white
dust
or
powder
which
was
so
light
that
did
they
but
receive
a
touch
they
must
lose
some
of
this
soft
white
powder
and
so
be
injured
so
gentle
and
tender
were
they
these
two
moths
soft
and
white
and
silent
arose
in
the
air
and
circled
one
about
the
other
rising
for
a
time
then
falling
but
ever
circling
one
about
the
other
it
seemed
that
perhaps
they
spoke
one
to
the
other
but
if
that
were
true
it
was
in
speech
so
small
that
not
even
i
could
hear
it
they
passed
over
the
tops
of
the
grasses
and
flowers
the
trees
where
they
seemed
very
small
i
do
not
know
why
these
moths
no
longer
cared
for
the
grasses
and
flowers
but
i
saw
them
circling
cross
over
the
little
stream
high
in
the
air
and
then
pass
on
directly
into
the
wide
dark
forest
for
a
moment
they
appeared
a
small
spot
of
white
against
the
black
shadows
of
the
forest
across
the
stream
then
they
went
on
straight
into
the
shadows
until
i
could
no
longer
see
this
small
spot
of
white
they
made
it
is
in
this
way
said
the
singing
mouse
that
human
souls
pass
through
life
to
me
who
can
see
them
they
look
small
and
delicate
and
white
and
they
circle
one
about
another
and
they
pass
on
into
the
deep
forest
illustration

house

dreams

the
house
of
dreams
upon
what
couch
i
asked
the
singing
mouse
may
one
have
the
most
noble
dreams
me
with
its
bright
eye
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
walls
opened
and
widened
i
saw
that
i
was
within
a
great
palace
whose
walls
were
hung
in
tapestries
and
whose
doors
were
of
golden
panelings
and
whose
windows
were
of
curious
crystals
and
whose
furnishings
were
rich
and
wonderful
and
around
whose
stately
limits
swam
wide
gardens
of
strange
flowers
full
of
deep
perfumes
i
heard
soft
voices
of
birds
and
the
music
also
of
gentle
human
voices
singing
and
tenderly
played
instruments
of
silken
and
silvern
strings
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
lay
upon
a
great
couch
of
thrice
piled
down
and
touched
hands
with
delights
in
all
manners
that
one
could
think
but
alas
i
did
not
dream
as
i
lay
upon
this
couch
then
i
saw
these
walls
fade
away
in
turn
and
in
their
stead
arose
a
vast
cathedral
of
the
woods
a
music
was
in
the
trees
and
a
solemn
mountain
stood
as
orator
to
the
sky
for
me
my
couch
was
that
of
upon
the
grasses
all
about
i
touched
hands
with
delights
and
so
i
dreamed
and
was
very
happy
and
content
again
the
place
changed
and
i
lay
in
my
own

room

naked

at
all
their

you
can
see
for
yourself
that

as
that
would
never

fit
such
a
short
pair
of
twins
so
the
twins
mother

said
they
can
not
be
called
christopher
and
katrina
until
they
are
four
and
a
half
feet
high
now
it
takes
a
long
time
to
grow
four
and
a
half
feet
of
boy
and
girl
you
know
chickens
and
puppies
and
colts
and
kittens
always
grow
up
much
faster
than

a
great
many
breakfasts

dinners

suppers
and
played
a
great
many
plays
and
had
a
great
many
happy
days
while
they
were
growing
up
to
their
names
i
will
tell
you
about
some
of
them
i
the
day
they
went
fishing
one
door
of
her
little
dutch
kitchen
and
stepped
out
she
looked
across
the
road
which
ran
by
the
house
across
the
canal
on
the
other
side
across
the
level
green
fields
that
lay
beyond
clear
to
the
blue
rim
of
the
world
where
the
sky
touches
the
earth
the
sky
was
very
blue
and
the
great
round
shining
face
of
the
sun
was
just
peering
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
as
she
looked
out
vrouw
vedder
listened
the
roosters
in
the
barnyard
were
crowing
the
ducks
in
the
canal
were
quacking
and
all
the
little
birds
in
the
fields
were
singing
for
joy
vrouw
vedder
hummed
a
slow
little
tune
of
her
own
as
she
went
back
into
her
kitchen
kit
and
kat
were
still
asleep
in
their
little
cupboard
bed
she
gave
them
each
a
kiss
the
twins
opened
their
eyes
and
sat
up
o
kit
and
kat
said
vrouw
vedder
the
sun
is
up
the
birds
are
all
awake
and
singing
hurry
you
may
go
with
him
he
is
coming
at
six
o
clock
so
pop
out
of
bed
and
get
dressed
i
will
put
some
lunch
for
you
in
the
yellow
basket
and
you
may
dig
worms
for
bait
in
the
garden
only
be
sure
not
to
step
on
the
young
cabbages
that
father
planted
kit
and
kat
bounced
out
of
bed
in
a
minute
their
mother
helped
them
put
on
their
clothes
and
new
wooden
shoes
then
she
gave
them
each
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
for
their
breakfast
they
ate
it
sitting
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
this
is
a
picture
of
kit
and
kat
digging
worms
you
see
they
did
just
as
their
mother
said
and
did
not
step
on
the
young
cabbages
they
sat
on
them
instead
but
that
was
an
accident
kit
dug
the
worms
and
kat
put
them
into
a
basket
with
some
earth
in
it
to
make
them
feel
at
home
when
grandfather
came
he
brought
a
large
fishing
rod
for
himself
and
two
hook
on
the
end
of
each
line
vrouw
vedder
kissed
kit
and
kat
good
bye
mind
grandfather
and
do
nt
fall
into
the
water
she
said
grandfather
and
the
twins
started
off
together
down
the
long
road
beside
the
canal
the
house
where
the
twins
lived
was
right
beside
the
canal
their
father
was
a
gardener
and
his
beautiful
rows
of
cabbages
and
beets
and
onions
stretched
in
long
lines
across
the
level
fields
by
the
roadside
grandfather
lived
in
a
large
town
a
little
way
beyond
the
farm
where
the
twins
lived
he
did
not
often
have
a
holiday
because
he
carried
milk
to
the
doors
of
the
people
in
the
town
every
morning
early
sometime
i
will
tell
you
how
he
did
it
but
i
must
not
tell
you
now
because
if
i
do
i
ca
nt
tell
you
about
their
going
fishing
this
morning
grandfather
carried
his
rod
and
the
lunch
basket
kit
and
kat
carried
the
basket
of
worms
between
them
and
their
rods
over
their
they
walked
along
ever
so
far
beside
the
canal
then
they
turned
to
the
left
and
walked
along
a
path
that
ran
from
the
canal
across
the
green
fields
to
what
looked
like
a
hill
but
it
was
nt
a
hill
at
all
really
because
there
are
nt
any
hills
in
holland
it
was
a
long
long
wall
of
earth
very
high
oh
as
high
as
a
house
or
even
higher
and
it
had
sloping
sides
there
is
such
a
wall
of
earth
all
around
the
country
of
holland
where
the
twins
live
there
has
to
be
a
wall
because
the
sea
is
higher
than
the
land
if
there
were
no
walls
to
shut
out
the
sea
the
whole
country
would
be
covered
with
water
and
if
that
were
so
then
there
would
nt
be
any
holland
or
any
holland
twins
or
any
story
so
you
see
it
was
very
lucky
for
the
twins
that
the
wall
was
there
they
called
it
a
dyke
grandfather
and
kit
and
they
his
house
of
a
bit
of
hopeful
young
life
was
like
the
lighting
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
hearth
the
girl
was
more
than
the
bright
serviceable
creature
he
had
thought
her
she
had
an
eye
to
see
and
an
ear
to
hear
he
could
show
her
things
and
tell
her
things
left
long
reverberations
and
echoes
he
could
wake
at
will
it
was
during
their
night
walks
back
to
the
farm
that
he
felt
most
intensely
the
sweetness
of
this
communion
he
had
always
been
more
sensitive
than
the
people
about
him
to
the
appeal
of
natural
beauty
his
unfinished
studies
had
given
form
to
this
sensibility
and
even
in
his
unhappiest
moments
field
and
sky
spoke
to
him
with
a
deep
and
powerful
persuasion
but
hitherto
the
emotion
had
remained
in
him
as
a
silent
ache
veiling
with
sadness
the
beauty
that
evoked
it
he
did
not
even
know
whether
any
one
else
in
the
world
felt
as
he
did
or
whether
he
was
the
sole
victim
of
this
mournful
privilege
then
he
learned
that
one
other
spirit
had
trembled
with
the
same
touch
of
wonder
that
at
his
side
living
under
his
roof
and
eating
his
bread
was
a
creature
to
whom
he
could
say
that
s
orion
down
yonder
the
big
fellow
to
the
right
is
aldebaran
and
the
bunch
of
little
ones
like
bees
hold
entranced
before
a
ledge
of
granite
thrusting
up
through
the
fern
while
he
unrolled
the
huge
panorama
of
the
ice
age
and
the
long
dim
stretches
of
succeeding
time
the
fact
that
admiration
for
his
learning
mingled
with
mattie
s
wonder
at
what
he
taught
was
not
the
least
part
of
his
pleasure
and
there
were
other
sensations
less
definable
but
more
exquisite
which
drew
them
together
with
a
shock
of
silent
joy
the
cold
red
of
sunset
behind
winter
hills
the
flight
of
cloud
flocks
over
slopes
of
golden
stubble
or
the
intensely
blue
shadows
of
hemlocks
on
sunlit
snow
when
she
said
to
him
once
it
looks
just
as
if
it
was
painted
it
seemed
to
ethan
that
the
art
of
definition
could
go
no
farther
and
that
words
had
at
last
been
found
to
utter
his
secret
soul
as
he
stood
in
the
darkness
outside
the
church
these
memories
came
back
with
the
poignancy
of
vanished
things
watching
mattie
whirl
down
the
floor
from
hand
to
hand
he
wondered
how
he
could
to
him
who
was
never
gay
but
in
her
presence
her
gaiety
seemed
plain
proof
of
indifference
the
face
she
lifted
to
her
dancers
was
the
same
which
when
she
saw
him
always
looked
like
a
window
that
has
caught
the
sunset
he
even
noticed
two
or
three
gestures
which
in
his
fatuity
he
had
thought
she
kept
for
him
a
way
of
throwing
her
head
back
when
she
was
amused
as
if
to
taste
her
laugh
before
she
let
it
out
and
a
trick
of
sinking
her
lids
slowly
when
anything
charmed
or
moved
her
the
sight
made
him
unhappy
and
his
unhappiness
roused
his
latent
fears
his
wife
had
never
shown
any
jealousy
of
mattie
but
of
late
she
had
grumbled
increasingly
over
the
house
work
and
found
oblique
ways
of
attracting
attention
to
the
girl
s
inefficiency
zeena
had
always
been
what
starkfield
called
sickly
and
frome
had
to
admit
that
if
she
were
as
ailing
as
she
believed
she
needed
the
help
of
a
stronger
arm
than
night
walks
to
the
farm
mattie
had
no
natural
turn
for
housekeeping
and
her
training
had
done
nothing
to
remedy
the
defect
she
was
quick
to
learn
but
forgetful
and
dreamy
and
not
disposed
to
take
the
matter
seriously
ethan
had
an
idea
that
if
she
were
to
marry
a
man
she
was
fond
of
the
dormant
instinct
would
wake
and
her
pies
and
biscuits
become
the
pride
of
the
county
but
domesticity
in
the
abstract
did
not
interest
her
at
first
she
was
so
awkward
that
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
her
but
she
laughed
with
him
and
that
made
them
better
friends
he
did
his
best
to
supplement
her
unskilled
efforts
getting
up
earlier
than
usual
to
light
the
kitchen
fire
carrying
in
the
wood
overnight
and
neglecting
the
mill
for
the
farm
that
he
might
help
her
about
the
house
during
the
day
he
even
crept
down
on
saturday
nights
to
scrub
the
kitchen
floor
after
the
women
had
gone
to
bed
and
zeena
one
day
had
surprised
him
one
of
her
queer
looks
of
late
there
had
been
other
signs
of
her
disfavour
as
intangible
but
more
disquieting
one
cold
winter
morning
as
he
dressed
in
the
dark
his
candle
flickering
in
the
draught
of
the
ill
fitting
window
he
had
heard
her
speak
from
the
bed
behind
him
the
doctor
do
nt
want
i
should
be
left
without
anybody
to
do
for
me
she
said
in
her
flat
whine
he
had
supposed
her
to
be
asleep
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
had
startled
him
though
she
was
given
to
abrupt
explosions
of
speech
after
long
intervals
of
secretive
silence
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
where
she
lay
indistinctly
outlined
under
the
dark
calico
quilt
her
high
boned
face
taking
a
grayish
tinge
from
the
whiteness
of
the
pillow
nobody
to
do
for
you
he
repeated
if
you
say
you
ca
nt
afford
a
hired
girl
when
mattie
goes
frome
turned
away
again
and
taking
up
his
razor
stooped
to
catch
the
reflection
of
his
why
on
earth
should
mattie
go
well
when
she
gets
married
i
mean
his
wife
s
drawl
came
from
behind
him
oh
she
d
never
leave
us
as
long
as
you
needed
her
he
returned
scraping
hard
at
his
chin
i
would
nt
ever
have
it
said
that
i
stood
in
the
way
of
a
poor
girl
like
mattie
marrying
a
smart
fellow
like
denis
eady
zeena
answered
in
a
tone
of
plaintive
self
effacement
ethan
glaring
at
his
face
in
raymond
case
had
begun
his
recital
adam
adams
began
to
show
an
interest
if
the
man
was
strangled
his
throat
should
show
the
marks
he
observed
there
are
no
marks
and
the
doctors
have
found
no
trace
of
poison
humph
the
detective
rubbed
his
chin
reflectively
what
next
margaret
langmore
was
so
horrified
she
ran
from
the
the
spot
and
a
minute
later
two
of
the
neighbors
mrs
bardon
and
her
son
alfred
came
over
from
next
door
where
was
mrs
langmore
at
this
time
nobody
knew
alfred
bardon
is
a
physician
and
thinking
there
might
still
be
a
spark
of
life
in
mr
langmore
did
all
he
possibly
could
to
resuscitate
the
gentleman
the
servant
girl
ran
upstairs
to
find
some
drugs
for
him
and
in
the
upper
hallway
stumbled
over
the
dead
body
of
mrs
langmore
and
how
had
she
died
in
the
same
manner
as
her
husband
this
news
of
a
double
tragedy
was
too
much
for
margaret
and
she
fainted
the
others
notified
more
of
the
neighbors
and
the
police
and
of
course
the
news
spread
like
wildfire
i
was
stopping
at
the
beechwood
hotel
at
the
time
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
the
tragedy
i
jumped
into
an
automobile
that
was
handy
and
rode
over
then
you
arrived
at
the
house
little
before
what
did
you
see
just
what
i
have
told
you
the
doctor
had
been
trying
to
bring
mr
langmore
around
but
had
suddenly
been
taken
sick
and
could
do
nothing
humph
sick
eh
did
he
say
what
made
him
sick
he
did
not
know
he
thought
it
might
be
from
leaning
over
the
dead
man
or
from
working
in
that
position
i
think
the
sudden
sickness
frightened
him
a
little
when
the
police
arrived
what
did
they
find
of
importance
nothing
had
anything
been
stolen
nothing
so
far
as
they
could
learn
of
course
you
must
have
known
these
folks
pretty
well
to
take
such
an
interest
i
knew
mr
langmore
very
well
and
i
was
acquainted
with
his
wife
adam
adams
knit
his
brow
for
a
moment
and
tapped
lightly
on
his
desk
with
his
forefinger
have
the
police
any
idea
as
to
how
the
he
asked
at
this
question
raymond
case
s
face
flushed
they
do
not
think
the
murderer
left
the
house
he
answered
in
a
low
tone
chapter
ii
love
under
a
shadow
raymond
case
dropped
back
into
his
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
adam
adams
eyed
him
curiously
and
with
something
of
a
fatherly
glance
it
is
plain
to
see
what
his
trouble
is
thought
the
detective
he
is
in
love
he
was
right
raymond
case
was
furiously
desperately
hopelessly
in
love
he
had
met
margaret
langmore
at
bar
harbor
but
a
few
short
weeks
before
and
it
had
been
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
upon
both
sides
a
few
automobile
rides
and
a
few
dances
and
he
had
proposed
and
been
accepted
and
he
had
counted
himself
the
happiest
man
in
all
this
wide
world
and
now
then
they
suspect
the
servant
girl
queried
adam
adams
knowing
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
no
ah
yes
it
is
is
preposterous
absurd
but
they
insist
and
that
is
what
has
brought
me
to
you
i
want
to
prove
her
innocence
to
the
world
do
that
and
you
can
name
your
own
price
mr
adams
you
have
a
high
regard
for
the
young
lady
you
are
close
friends
more
i
may
as
well
tell
you
though
so
far
margaret
and
i
have
kept
the
matter
more
or
less
a
secret
i
love
her
and
we
are
engaged
to
be
married
did
mr
langmore
know
of
his
daughter
s
engagement
he
did
and
he
approved
of
it
and
what
of
mrs
langmore
did
nt
she
approve
she
did
not
know
of
it
margaret
did
not
tell
her
why
not
because
well
the
young
lady
and
her
stepmother
did
not
get
along
very
well
together
margaret
wanted
to
be
friendly
but
mrs
langmore
was
very
dictatorial
and
s
let
me
ask
was
the
daughter
on
good
terms
with
her
father
yes
excepting
on
one
point
he
wished
her
to
obey
her
stepmother
and
that
she
was
not
always
willing
to
do
this
brought
on
a
run
of
petty
quarrels
which
fairly
made
margaret
sick
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
police
think
miss
langmore
the
guilty
person
it
is
their
theory
is
that
she
first
quarrelled
with
her
stepmother
and
murdered
her
and
then
struck
down
her
father
to
cover
her
guilt
he
having
discovered
what
she
was
doing
how
old
is
miss
langmore
she
has
just
passed
her
twenty
third
birthday
humph
rather
young
to
commit
such
a
cold
blooded
crime
as
this
she
never
did
do
it
i
ll
wager
my
life
on
it
oh
it
s
absurd
insulting
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
a
lot
of
pig
headed
country
police
how
did
they
come
to
suspect
her
was
mrs
bardon
the
woman
who
lives
next
door
is
a
great
gossip
and
one
who
is
continually
poking
her
nose
into
other
folks
business
she
told
the
police
that
she
was
out
in
the
garden
cutting
a
bouquet
early
in
the
morning
and
she
heard
a
violent
quarrel
going
on
at
the
breakfast
table
between
mrs
langmore
and
margaret
and
that
mr
langmore
took
his
wife
s
part
margaret
wished
to
give
a
small
house
party
and
mrs
langmore
would
not
listen
to
it
did
mrs
bardon
hear
all
that
was
said
no
only
enough
to
make
her
run
to
the
police
with
the
tale
is
any
other
house
near
by
the
harrison
mansion
but
it
is
locked
up
as
the
family
is
in
europe
did
you
hear
if
mrs
bardon
and
her
son
were
home
all
morning
they
were
excepting
when
the
doctor
went
out
to
make
some
calls
between
nine
and
eleven
did
they
see
not
a
soul
did
mary

servant

told

where
did

deep
eyes
oh
that
s
all
gaston
will
get
them
back
jude
wiped
his
heavy
lips
on
the
back
of
his
hand
but
it
must
have
taken
a
good
deal
come
joyce
jude
scowled
you
creep
back
to
your
corner
when
women
get
to
tangling
up
money
with
their
own
doings
it
s
the
devil
you
keep
to
your
business
girl
and
leave
deeper
matters
alone
gaston
frowned
something
lay
back
of
that
care
traced
line
on
joyce
s
forehead
something
lay
back
of
her
questioning
what
was
it
and
jude
s
assumption
of
the
male
superiority
over
his
young
wife
disturbed
gaston
he
had
not
noticed
it
so
sharply
before
presently
joyce
took
the
low
stool
and
clasped
her
knees
in
her
enfolding
arms
the
two
men
had
filled
their
pipes
and
now
through
the
dim
haze
looked
at
the
fair
dreamy
face
between
them
then
jude
laid
his
pipe
aside
and
snored
the
clock
ticked
softly
the
logs
fell
apart
in
a
red
glow
in
drawing
nearer
gaston
and
the
pretty
bent
head
came
within
easy
distance
of
the
hand
lying
inert
on
the
chair
arm
jude
gets
awfully
sleepy
in
the
heat
joyce
whispered
you
do
nt
mind
no
why
should
i
but
i
ought
to
be
going
you
are
tired
too
no
the
sudden
upward
glance
was
all
a
quiver
with
alertness
i
do
nt
ever
seem
tired
now
keeping
one
s
own
house
is
great
and
it
seems
like
everything
is
waking
up
every
minute
sometimes
i
hate
to
go
to
sleep
for
fear
i
ll
miss
something
and
now
gaston
s
hand
touched
the
heavy
curves
of
pale
gold
hair
you
have
made
a
home
he
said
i
wonder
if
you
know
what
a
great
achievement
that
is
i
wonder
if
jude
knows
joyce
winced
oh
if
he
s
a
bit
cross
with
me
she
whispered
softly
do
nt
you
mind
i
understand
i
suppose
you
do
gaston
smoothed
the
silken
hair
but
make
him
understand
joyce
it
takes
understanding
on
both
sides
you
know
and
mr
gaston
the
girl
changed
the
subject
as
adroitly
as
a
more
worldly
wise
woman
might
have
done
you
helped
me
make
this
home
i
ai
nt
ever
going
to
let
you
forget
that
these
pictures
her
loving
glance
took
them
all
in
and
the
books
coming
and
going
just
fast
enough
to
keep
me
nimble
it
seems
like
you
d
opened
a
gate
and
let
some
of
the
big
world
in
there
s
plenty
of
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
two
solitudes
joyce
gaston
s
hand
fell
gently
along
the
warm
throat
and
rested
on
the
bent
shoulder
jude
gave
another
gurgling
snore
the
two
did
not
change
their
positions
but
there
was
silence
for
an
instant
that
mountain
top
all
jagged
and
high
my
how
it
just
makes
day
long
climb
to
getting
somewhere
out
beyond
and
that
great
empty
picture
with
the
awful
white
wave
coming
from
nowhere
it
just
makes
me
hold
my
breath
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
it
was
going
to
swallow
up
everything
and
me
it
do
nt
ever
do
that
does
it
mr
gaston
it
has
done
damage
of
that
kind
in
its
time
but
generally
it
obeys
orders
and
stops
at
the
safety
line
gaston
smiled
into
the
wondering
eyes
i
like
the
picture
i
like
it
terribly
breathed
the
girl
but
i
d
hate
the
real
thing
i
am
sure
it
makes
a
terrific
noise
gaston
nodded
and
old
memories
seemed
beating
in
upon
him
it
would
wear
me
out
by
its
own
restlessness
gaston
s
thought
ran
along
with
the
cruder
one
its
restlessness
is
at
times
unbearable
unless
one
is
very
young
and
happy
but
i
am
young
and
happy
joyce
spoke
lingeringly
and
her
eyes
grew
fixed
upon
the
it
and
be
afraid
of
it
it
s
beautiful
but
it
s
awful
i
do
nt
like
awful
things
i
like
to
look
up
at
that
brave
old
mountain
and
know
it
will
always
be
the
same
no
matter
what
happens
down
below
suddenly
gaston
felt
old
very
old
beside
this
girl
near
him
with
her
intuitive
soul
stretches
and
her
hampered
life
so
the
mountain
is
your
favourite
picture
joyce
a
grandfatherly
tone
crept
into
his
voice
and
the
caressing
hand
touched
the
round
pale
outline
of
cheek
and
chin
with
the
assurance
of
age
and
superiority
but
the
girl
tingled
under
it
no
she
said
almost
breathlessly
i
like
that
best
of
all
and
she
pointed
a
trembling
finger
toward
the
madonna
and
child
gaston
was
conscious
of
a
palpitating
meaning
in
the
words
and
gesture
why
he
asked
softly
because
the
fair
head
was
lowered
not
in
timidity
but
in
deep
thought
because
i
want
it
my
at
the
picture
and
i
dream
about
it
at
night
i
know
every
little
dimple
and
the
soft
curls
and
all
i
pray
and
pray
and
if
god
answers
then
a
gentle
ferocity
rang
through
the
hurried
words
i
m
going
to
keep
it
so
it
s
going
to
be
different
from
any
other
little
child
in
st
ange
and
it
all
fits
in
now
that
mr
drew
is
coming
back
it
s
just
wonderful
it
was
mr
drew
that
set
me
thinking
about
leaving
something
better
for
them
as
come
after
he
said
terrible
strange
things
but
you
ca
nt
forget
them
can
you
i
ve
been
well
sort
of
weeding
out
my
life
ever
willing
under
the
circumstances
to
take
the
risk
first
the
cords
which
held
the
feet
were
severed
then
those
which
held
the
wooden
gag
in
place
then
that
which
confined
the
hands
when
this
last
cord
was
cut
two
muscular
arms
flew
up
and
seized
the
his
nose
was
buried
in
the
wet
clothes
of
the
man
he
had
released
let
up
he
muttered
in
a
smothered
voice
still
the
powerful
arms
drew
him
down
and
the
boy
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
he
had
not
better
use
his
bolo
when
a
voice
whispered
jimmie
is
it
dead
we
both
are
we
will
soon
be
if
you
do
nt
let
up
answered
jimmie
jimmie
from
the
bowery
demanded
the
other
sure
was
the
reply
what
is
this
anyway
a
catch
as
catch
can
if
you
do
nt
let
up
i
ll
take
a
rib
out
with
my
bolo
with
a
spring
which
almost
keeled
the
boy
over
the
figure
sprang
up
ducked
under
the
dripping
canvas
and
crouched
in
the
thicket
from
which
jimmie
had
observed
the
tent
jimmie
s
first
thought
was
to
follow
then
he
thought
of
the
remaining
prisoners
and
turned
to
cut
their
bonds
but
he
was
too
late
as
he
and
bent
low
for
the
purpose
of
entering
to
have
hesitated
longer
would
have
been
to
invite
capture
and
so
with
a
sigh
of
regret
the
boy
shot
under
the
canvas
and
joined
the
other
in
the
thicket
it
s
leg
bail
for
it
came
the
familiar
voice
of
pat
mack
and
the
boys
poked
their
faces
into
the
thicket
and
kept
going
regardless
of
the
thorns
and
creepers
which
tore
at
their
garments
and
tripped
their
feet
it
was
so
dark
now
that
they
could
not
see
a
hand
held
two
inches
from
their
eyes
but
they
kept
on
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
chapter
vii
a
missing
motor
boat
you
rapscallion
pat
mack
whispered
as
the
two
came
together
in
the
embrace
of
a
particularly
tough
creeper
how
did
you
ever
get
here
i
saw
you
last
on
the
good
old
bowery
i
did
nt
fly
over
replied
jimmie
here
he
added
take
this
mean
by
chokin
me
when
i
cut
you
loose
a
hug
of
affection
retorted
the
other
you
looked
like
an
angel
to
me
did
you
flutter
down
from
the
sky
in
the
rain
i
ought
to
give
you
a
good
punch
for
it
jimmie
replied
you
near
took
the
hide
off
me
beautiful
nose
have
you
got
that
bloomin
steel
cable
cut
seems
to
me
they
are
comin
after
us
the
boys
stood
perfectly
still
and
listened
above
the
patter
of
the
rain
above
the
murmur
of
the
trees
above
the
chattering
of
the
aroused
monkeys
came
the
crash
of
heavy
bodies
through
the
bushes
the
sound
of
human
voices
sure
they
are
whispered
pat
and
they
set
off
again
working
their
way
painfully
through
the
jungle
falling
now
and
then
over
long
vines
coming
into
contact
with
great
trees
and
swinging
parasites
which
brushed
against
their
faces
like
snakes
the
boys
pressed
on
as
came
closer
the
pursuers
were
more
familiar
with
jungle
methods
than
they
and
no
pretense
of
secrecy
was
made
have
you
got
a
gun
whispered
jimmie
i
have
nt
even
got
a
toothpick
was
the
reply
we
ll
have
to
fight
before
long
jimmie
said
panting
with
the
exertion
of
the
unfamiliar
struggle
with
the
jungle
there
s
plenty
of
hollow
trees
about
suggested
pat
why
not
hide
in
one
of
them
until
they
pass
the
suggestion
seemed
a
good
one
for
a
moment
then
the
uselessness
of
such
an
effort
at
concealment
became
apparent
with
sinking
hearts
the
boys
heard
the
low
whine
of
a
hound
i
wonder
how
they
managed
to
track
us
so
easily
jimmie
said
give
me
the
bolo
pat
said
i
ll
split
the
dog
s
head
open
if
he
comes
near
us
use
your
gun
on
the
men
the
boys
did
not
give
up
hope
of
however
the
acclivity
they
were
ascending
grew
steeper
as
they
advanced
and
they
were
obliged
to
stop
now
and
then
to
rest
on
one
of
these
occasions
they
heard
a
commotion
in
the
jungle
just
ahead
of
them
this
was
disheartening
they
ve
flanked
us
whispered
pat
the
pursuers
were
carrying
a
torch
which
in
the
rain
gave
a
dim
light
but
still
served
to
direct
their
steps
and
the
glow
of
the
flame
now
reached
to
the
very
spot
where
the
lads
stood
the
bushes
behind
them
parted
and
the
glowing
eyes
of
the
hound
looked
up
in
their
faces
then
the
call
of
the
beast
told
the
men
following
that
he
had
at
last
sighted
his
prey
the
boys
turned
to
flee
again
but
came
up
against
an
almost
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
the
pursuers
saw
them
now
and
came
on
with
cries
of
victory
guess
they
ve
got
us
pat
said
not
yet
jimmie
answered
but
however
courageous
the
lads
been
taken
in
a
moment
had
they
not
received
unexpected
assistance
the
hound
was
almost
at
their
feet
when
a
shot
was
heard
and
the
great
beast
fell
to
the
ground
struggled
for
an
instant
and
lay
still
another
shot
followed
the
first
instantly
and
the
torch
dropped
from
the
uplifted
hand
of
the
evil
faced
man
who
was
carrying
it
in
the
lead
an
intense
uncanny
darkness
followed
the
extinction
of
the
torch
and
the
two
boys
took
advantage
of
it
to
edge
around
the
face
of
the
rock
which
had
blocked
their
progress
without
the
help
of
the
dog
and
without
the
torch
the
pursuers
could
do
little
and
stood
on
equal
terms
with
the
pursued
it
was
impossible
of
course
for
the
boys
to
make
their
way
through
the
jungle
without
making
any
noise
and
in
a
moment
the
pursuing
party
showed
its
temper
by
firing
revengeful
shots
at
the
spots
from
which
the
sounds
of
their
progress
proceeded
after
half
a
dozen
bullets
had
is
no
key
here
s
a
hatchet
cried
another
boy
running
in
from
the
kitchen
clear
the
way
and
let
me
at
the
door
the
boy
was
greg
holmes
he
brought
the
hatchet
down
with
telling
force
at
each
blow
smashing
all
the
paneling
around
the
lock
in
a
very
few
moments
greg
had
the
door
open
and
he
and
dave
helped
catch
dick
as
the
latter
fell
forward
dizzy
and
all
but
unconscious
rush
him
out
on
to
the
front
porch
ordered
dave
then
we
ll
come
back
and

fire
dick
as
he
reached
the
porch
and
took
in
a
life
saving
breath
of
the
pure
cool
air
no
admitted
dave
we
forgot
that
but
i
ll
run
and

yard

an
alarm

answer

to
remain
and

what
he
could

m
all
right

declared
dick
getting
up
out
of
the
chair

which
he
had
been
dropped

too
strong

i

when
greg
after
darting
downstairs
with
the
child
returned
he
had
two
other
boys
with
him
it
took
all
four
to
get
jane

and

of

porch

mrs

s
doctor
while
making
that
comment
dick
darted
back
to
the
telephone
as
seconds
were
precious
here
he
merely
called
up
central
and
stated
what
was
wanted
then
he
ran
to
join
the
others
there
s
a
hose
outside
this
window

seen

the
window

then

andy
sizz
zz
dave
directed
the
stream
against
the
liveliest
flames
it
was
only
a
lawn
sprinkling
hose
that
he
held
but
even
that
threw
a
lot
of
water
dick
climbed
in
through
the
window
again
we
ll
hold
things
down
until
the
firemen
get
here
he
announced
energetically
so
busy
had
all
been
that
only
two
or
three
out
of
the
ten
boys
present
had
noticed
that
the
fire
alarm
whistle
had
called
off
the
box
number
some
time
previously
finally
with
a
screeching
of
whistles
and
a
clanging
of
gongs
a
part
of
the
gridley
fire
department
hauled
up
outside
while
hosemen
fastened
a
line
to
a
hydrant
and
nozzlemen
dragged
the
lengths
in
through
the
wide
open
front
door
the
chief
ran
ahead
of
them
where
s
the
fire
he
called
and
made
his
way
inside
well
you
boys
are
dandies
remarked
the
chief
grimly
then
that
stream
off
the
chief
bellowed
hoarsely
a
lot
of
grammar
school
boys
have
put
the
fire
out
with
a
lawn
hose
two
or
three
minutes
later
the
policeman
whom
prescott
had
summoned
arrived
out
of
breath
two
minutes
after
that
dr
bentley
s
auto
stopped
at
the
door
both
unconscious
women
were
revived
and
myra
who
had
not
once
awakened
in
all
the
excitement
was
taken
up
and
tucked
in
bed
how
did
you
get
into
the
house
dick
mrs
dexter
at
last
found
time
to
inquire
why
the
door
was
open
just
a
crack
ma
am
when
i
got
here
i
heard
dexter
threatening
you
and
realized
that
you
must
be
alone
i
knew
i
could
nt
do
much
alone
so
i
sneaked
in
as
softly
as
i
could
and
got
to
the
telephone
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
with
only
his
boy
friends
about
dick
demanded
to
know
how
they
had
arrived
so
opportunely
that
s
easy
you
left
me
i
ran
into
greg
tom
dan
and
harry
i
told
them
where
you
d
gone
and
what
the
business
would
probably
turn
out
to
be
then
then
well
we
got
so
awfully
curious
that
we
made
up
our
minds
to
stroll
up
here
to
the
corner
and
wait
until
you
came
out
then
we
ran
into
four
other
fellows
from
our
school
and
there
was
a
mob
of
us
to
kill
time
we
walked
down
past
as
we
went
past
we
saw
smoke
coming
out
of
one
of
the
open
windows
on
the
ground
floor
then
bert
johnson
remembered
that
he
had
seen
ab
dexter
come
out
and
hurry
away
it
did
nt
take
us
long
then
to
make
up
our
minds
to
get
into
the
house
we
found
the
front
door
unlocked
and
the
rest
was
easy
we
ll
get
out
of
here
as
soon
as
we
can
now
hinted
dick
why
dalzell
wanted
to
know
this
is
the
center
of
prescott
replied
but
as
soon
as
mrs
dexter
thinks
of
it
she
ll
send
for
us
and
offer
more
thanks
and
rewards
we
can
get
away
most
any
time
now
and
there
comes
her
special
policeman
dexter
wo
nt
be
back
to
night
anyway
so
the
grammar
school
boys
slipped
away
but
they
had
added
another
page
to
the
history
of
gridley
dexter
with
his
usual
luck
appeared
to
have
made
a
safe
retreat
the
police
paid
a
visit
to
his
former
cave
up
the
road
but
did
not
catch
him
there
although
a
police
guard
was
kept
at
the
cave
for
three
days
but
dick
received
a
postal
card
on
the
back
of
which
was

it

with
white

matched

arranged
with
marvellous
exactitude
something
made
for
but
long
and
indubitably
capacious
something
with
a
hood
a
little
cloak
possibly
i
do
nt
know
but
i
am
sure
that
it
could
envelop
that
it
could
boil
or
roast
that
it
could
fairly
smother
a

it
was
lined
with
golden
brown
crackling
silk
which
pattie

s
mother
had
left
in
her

upon
her
last
departure
poor
woman
from
the
sordid
world
of
swamp
s
end
to
regions
which
were
now
become
in

loving
vision
places
of
light
and
it
was
upon
this
treasured
cloth
that
pattie
batch
s
flashing
needle
was
working
like
mad
in
the
lamplight
a
christmas
sacrifice
it
was
labour
of
love
and
the
gift
of
treasure
pattie
batch
was
lovely
everybody
knew
it
and
there
s
no
denying
it
grief
had
not
left
her
wan
and
apathetic
she
had
been
a
little
man
she
had
been
so
much
of
a
little
man
that
she
was
now
much
more
of
a
little
woman
than
ever
she
there
s
no
mincing
matters
at
all
it
would
shame
a
man
to
hem

haw
and
qualify
she
was
adorable
beauty
of
youth
and
heart
of

a
quaint
little
on
the
shark
was
the
reply
if
they
ve
got
him
he
ll
never
come
back
gritted
the
captain
but
they
have
nt
said
the
boy
we
re
going
to
run
the
sea
lion
over
to
the
shark
now
and
help
them
entertain
him
you
re
a
fool
roared
moore
do
nt
you
tell
them
that
we
are
on

my
son
and
myself
do
nt
it
do
nt
you
tell
them
if
you
do
they
will
raid
your
ship
and
get
us
so
you
ve
been
playing
some
dirty
trick
on
them
have
you
asked
jack
well
what
about
your
meeting
them
at
hongkong
that
was
a
lie
you
are
out
with
them
they
are
out
with

they
claim
i
am
keeping
them
out
of
a
lot
of
money
do
nt
tell
them

here
in
all
your
life
asked
jack
in
all
your
life
did
you
ever
do
business
with
any
man
woman
or
child
you
did
nt
cheat
and
betray
you
ought
to
be
hanged
if
nestor

you
send
him
here
and
i

tell

the
whole
story
if
he
ll
let
us
go
and
i

tell
him
how
to
get
the
papers
he
is
after

you

that
he
comes
if
he
gets
back
laughed
jack
to
have
a
talk
with
the
people
on
the
shark
ignoring
the
prisoner
s
further
demands
jack
turned
on
the
power
and
directed
the
sea
lion
toward
the
shark
in
a
moment
jimmie
called
down
through
the
hatchway
slow
up
now
unless
you
want
to
bunt
the
other
boat
jack
accordingly
shut
off
the
power
and
went
up
to
the
platform
the
boat
was
still
drifting
ahead
a
trifle
and
the
boy
went
below
again
and
dropped
an
anchor
if
the
advance
of
the
submarine
had
attracted
the
attention
of
those
on
the
shark
s
conning
tower
they
gave
no
evidence
of
the
fact
the
boat
ned
had
taken
lay
swinging
on
the
easy
sea
close
to
the
tower
with
frank
and
hans
sitting
near
the
stern
directly
voices
came
from
the
other
submarine
the
first
speaker
was
ned
then
a
heavier
voice
exclaimed
angrily
you
have
no
right
to
suppose
anything
of
the
kind
we
are
here
on
legitimate
business
did
you
take
from
the
wreck
asked
ned
what
is
it
to
you
came
the
stronger
voice
you
ca
nt
make
any
bluff
work
with
me
then
i
may
as
well
go
back
to
my
ship
ned
said
go
back
to
your
ship
snapped
the
other
not
if
i
know
myself
you
have
come
aboard
without
leave
or
license
and
you
ll
stay
until
we
get
good
and
ready
to
let
you
go
the
boys
saw
hans
and
frank
spring
for
the
platform
and
then
a
shout
of
triumph
came
from
half
a
dozen
throats
ned
surely
was
in
trouble
chapter
xviii
making
a
good
job
of
it
i
guess
they
ve
got
ned
jimmie
cried
as
the
heavy
hatch
of
the
shark
closed
with
a
slam
if
they
have
we
ll
ram
em
to
the
bottom
you
just
wait
jack
advised
there
s
a
good
deal
hans
is
putting
his
educated
left
into
motion
look
at
him
there
was
indeed
a
great
commotion
on
the
platform
presently
the
hatch
was
lifted
and
one
of
the
contestants
disappeared
do
you
mind
that
now
shouted
jimmie
ned
has
captured
the
boat
for
keeps
there
now
he
s
tellin
them
where
to
head
in
at
through
the
still
night
air
they
heard
ned
s
voice
you
people
down
there
know
what
i
am
here
for
if
the
thing
i
want
is
destroyed
you
ll
all
be
hanged
for
piracy
understand
then
the
hatch
was
jammed
down
again
and
ned
and
frank
stepped
into
the
rowboat
leaving
hans
on
the
platform
jimmie
threw
up
his
cap
when
the
two
boys
stepped
on
the
sea
lion
s
platform
you
captured
the
bunch
he
yelled
and
you
stole
the
boat
you
sure
made
a
good
job
of
it
what
s
the
proposition
asked
jack
port
where
i
can
communicate
with
an
american
man
of
war
replied
ned
this
is
luck
frank
exclaimed
luck
for
us
and
trouble
for
the
pirates
i
wonder
if
they
ve
got
much
gold
on
board
if
they
have
laughed
ned
hans
will
see
that
they
do
nt
get
away
with
it
they
re
nailed
down
hard
talk
about
the
luck
of
the
british
army
roared
jack
it
is
blind
adversity
to
the
luck
of
the
boy
scouts
here
we
ve
got
the
pirates
bunched
as
soon
as
we
communicate
with
a
man
of
war
we
ll
turn
em
over
to
uncle
sam
and
go
back
and
get
the
gold
the
shark
frank
observed
was
a
derelict
when
we
picked
her
up
was
nt
she
she
could
nt
move
a
foot
well
then
we
re
entitled
to
salvage
we
ll
put
in
a
bill
that
will
eat
up
the
whole
business
replied
the
old
tub
is
in
bad
shape
owing
to
the
bunting
she
gave
the
sea
lion
i
m
afraid
she
ll
go
down
before
morning
cripes
jimmie
broke
out
what
will
we
do
then
with
all
them
bold
bad
men
we
ve
got
our
penitentiary
full
now
and
the
prisoners
are
making
all
kinds
of
trouble
too
jack
added
if
the
door
was
nt
good
and
strong
it
d
be
in
splinters
by
this
time
that
young
moore
is
the
worst
we
wo
nt
cross
any
bridges
until
we
come
to
them
ned
remarked
the
shark
may
last
until
we
get
to
hongkong
anyway
i
m
counting
on
quite
a
run
before
she
goes
down
how
many
are
there
on
board
asked
jack
six
not
counting
hans
i
think
we
can
accommodate
them
all
on
board
the
sea
lion
if
we
have
to
the
sea
to
an
easterly
direction
with
the
idea
of
going
to
hongkong
something
over
miles
away
all
along
the
eastern
coast
of
kwang
tung
from
the
slender
i
found
that
the
bite
i
took
off
of
each
piece
i
had
had
in
hand
satisfied
me
as
nothing
i
had
ever
eaten
in
all
my
life
before
had
done
while
at
the
same
time
my
nibbles
soothed
his
conscience
about
robbing
me
his
teeth
are
big
and
strong
and
white
and
his
jaws
work
like
machinery
he
is
the
strongest
man
i
ever
saw
and
his
gauntness
is
all
muscle
what
is
that
glow
a
woman
gets
from
feeding
a
hungry
man
whom
she
likes
with
her
own
hands
and
why
should
i
want
to
be
certain
that
he
kissed
the
lace
on
my
sleeve
as
it
brushed
his
face
when
i
reached
across
him
to
catch
an
inquisitive
rose
that
i
saw
peeping
in
the
window
at
us
leaf
fifth
blue
absinthe
the
juice
of
a
lemon
in
two
glasses
of
cold
water
to
be
drunk
immediately
on
wakening
page
eleven
i
ve
handed
myself
that
lemon
every
morning
now
until
i
am
sensitive
with
myself
about
it
if
there
was
ever
anybody
on
the
water
wagon
it
s
i
and
i
have
to
sit
in
the
gallon
of
water
i
m
supposed
to
consume
in
that
time
sometime
i
m
going
to
get
mixed
up
and
try
to
drink
my
bath
if
i
do
nt
look
out
i
dreamed
night
before
last
that
i
was
taking
a
bath
in
a
glass
of
ice
cream
soda
water
and
trying
to
hide
from
doctor
john
behind
the
dab
of
ice
cream
that
seemed
inadequate
for
food
or
protection
i
have
nt
had
even
one
glass
for
two
months
and
i
woke
up
in
a
cold
perspiration
of
embarrassment
and
raging
hunger
i
do
nt
know
what
i
m
going
to
do
about
this
book
and
i
ve
got
myself
into
trouble
about
writing
things
besides
records
in
it
he
looked
at
me
this
morning
as
coolly
as
if
i
was
just
anybody
and
said
i
would
like
to
see
that
record
now
mrs
molly
it
seems
to
me
you
are
about
as
slim
as
you
want
to
be
how
did
you
tip
the
scales
last
time
you
weighed
and
have
you
noticed
any
trouble
at
all
with
your
heart
and
i
ve
got
to
melt
and
freeze
and
starve
off
that
four
i
answered
ignoring
the
heart
question
and
also
the
question
of
producing
this
book
wonder
what
he
would
do
if
i
gave
it
to
him
to
read
just
as
it
is
how
about
the
heart
he
persisted
and
i
may
have
imagined
the
smile
in
his
eyes
for
his
mouth
was
purely
professional
anyway
i
lowered
my
lashes
down
on
to
my
cheeks
and
answered
experimentally
sometimes
it
hurts
then
a
cyclone
happened
to
me
come
here
to
me
a
minute
he
said
quickly
and
he
turned
me
around
and
put
his
head
down
between
my
shoulders
and
held
me
so
tight
against
his
ear
that
i
could
hardly
breathe
expand
your
chest
three
times
and
breathe
as
deep
as
you
can
he
ordered
from
against
my
back
buttons
i
expanded
and
breathed
pretty
quickly
at
that
illustration
breathe
as
deep
as
you
can
now
hold
your
breath
as
long
fitted
my
mood
exactly
to
do
so
ca
nt
find
anything
he
said
at
last
letting
me
go
and
looking
carefully
at
my
face
his
eyes
were
all
anxiety
and
i
liked
it
when
does
it
hurt
you
and
how
he
asked
anxiously
moonlight
nights
and
lonesomely
i
answered
before
i
could
stop
myself
and
what
happened
then
was
worse
than
any
cyclone
he
got
white
for
a
minute
and
just
looked
at
me
as
if
i
was
a
bug
stuck
on
a
pin
then
gave
a
short
little
laugh
and
turned
to
the
table
i
did
nt
understand
you
were
joking
he
said
quietly
that
maddened
me
and
i
would
have
done
anything
to
make
him
think
i
was
not
the
foolish
thing
he
evidently
had
classified
me
as
being
i
snatched
at
my
mind
and
shook
out
a
mixture
of
truth
and
lies
that
fooled
even
myself
and
gave
them
to
him
looking
straight
in
his
face
i
would
have
cracked
all
the
i
m
not
joking
i
said
jerkily
i
am
lonesome
and
worse
than
being
lonesome
i
m
scared
i
ought
to
have
stayed
just
the
quiet
relict
of
mr
carter
and
gone
on
to
church
meetings
with
aunt
adeline
and
let
myself
be
fat
and
respectable
but
i
have
nt
got
the
character
you
thought
i
went
to
town
to
buy
a
monument
and
i
did
nt
i
bought
enough
clothes
for
two
brides
and
now
i
m
scared
to
wear
em
and
i
do
nt
know
what
you
ll
think
when
you
see
my
bank
book
everybody
is
talking
about
me
and
that
dinner
party
tuesday
night
and
aunt
adeline
says
she
ca
nt
live
in
a
house
of
mourning
so
desecrated
any
longer
she
s
going
back
to
the
cottage
aunt
bettie
pollard
says
that
if
i
want
to
get
married
i
ought
to
do
it
to
mr
wilson
graves
because
of
the
seven
children
and
then
everybody
would
be
so
relieved
that
they
are
taken
care
of
that
they
would
forget
that
mrs
johnson
says
i
ought
to
be
declared
a
minor
and
put
as
a
ward
to
you
i
ca
nt
help
judge
wade
s
sending
me
flowers
and
tom
s
sitting
on
my
front
steps
night
and
day
i
m
not
strong
enough
to
carry
him
away
and
murder
him
i
am
perfectly
miserable
and
i
m
now
that
ll
do
molly
just
hush
for
a
half
minute
and
let
me
talk
to
you
said
doctor
john
as
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
drew
me
near
him
no
wonder
your
heart
hurts
if
it
has
got
all
that
load
of
trouble
on
it
and
well
just
get
a
little
of
that
scare
off
you
put
yourself
in
my
hands
and
you
are
to
do
glad
to
receive
the
comfort
of
finding
one
s
brother
disinclined
to
take
what
saint
gregory
calls
a
sublime
tone
would
tend
illogically
i
own
to
ease
the
burden
of
anxiety
even
the
remote
reader
sick
of
discouraging
details
experiences
a
renewal
of
confidence
and
all
because
father
feron
s
good
humour
is
of
the
common
kind
which
we
can
best
understand
and
with
which
it
befits
every
one
of
us
to
meet
the
vicissitudes
of
life
i
have
said
that
the
ardent
reformer
is
seldom
gay
small
wonder
when
his
eyes
are
turned
upon
the
dark
places
of
earth
and
his
whole
strength
is
consumed
in
combat
yet
saint
teresa
the
most
redoubtable
reformer
of
her
quality
of
her
gladness
she
was
not
only
spiritually
serene
she
was
humanly
gay
and
this
in
the
face
of
acute
ill
health
and
many
profound
discouragements
we
have
the
evidence
of
all
her
contemporaries
friends
nuns
patrons
and
confessors
and
we
have
the
far
more
enduring
testimony
of
her
letters
in
proof
of
this
mirthfulness
of
spirit
which
won
its
way
into
hearts
and
lightened
the
austerities
of
her
rule
a
very
cheerful
and
gentle
disposition
an
excellent
temper
and
absolutely
void
of
melancholy
wrote
ribera
so
merry
that
when
she
laughed
every
one
laughed
with
her
but
very
grave
when
she
was
serious
there
is
a
strain
of
humour
a
delicate
and
somewhat
biting
wit
in
the
correspondence
of
saint
teresa
and
in
her
admonitions
to
her
nuns
there
is
also
an
inspired
common
sense
which
we
hardly
expect
to
find
in
the
writings
of
a
religious
and
a
mystic
but
teresa
was
not
withdrawn
from
the
world
she
travelled
establishing
new
foundations
visiting
her
convents
and
dealing
with
all
classes
of
men
from
the
soldier
to
the
priest
from
the
prince
to
the
peasant
the
severity
of
her
discipline
was
tempered
by
a
tolerant
and
half
amused
insight
into
the
pardonable
foibles
of
humanity
she
held
back
her
nuns
with
one
hand
from
the
frenzy
of
self
mortification
which
is
the
mainstay
of
spiritual
vanity
and
with
the
other
hand
from
a
too
solicitous
regard
for
their
own
comfort
and
convenience
they
were
not
to
consider
that
the
fear
of
a
headache
a
non
existent
headache
threatening
the
future
was
sufficient
excuse
for
absenting
themselves
from
choir
and
if
they
were
too
ailing
to
practise
any
other
austerities
the
rule
of
silence
she
reminded
them
could
do
the
feeblest
no
harm
do
not
contend
wordily
over
matters
of
no
consequence
was
her
counsel
of
perfection
fly
a
thousand
leagues
from
such
observations
as
you
see
i
was
right
or
they
did
me
an
injustice
long
as
teresa
ruled
practical
and
fearless
save
when
a
lizard
ran
up
her
sleeve
on
which
occasion
she
confesses
she
nearly
died
of
fright
her
much
sought
advice
was
always
on
the
side
of
reason
asceticism
she
prized
dirt
she
abhorred
for
the
love
of
heaven
she
wrote
to
the
provincial
gratian
then
occupied
with
his
first
foundation
of
discalced
friars
let
your
fraternity
be
careful
that
they
have
clean
beds
and
tablecloths
even
though
it
be
more
expensive
for
it
is
a
terrible
thing
not
to
be
cleanly
no
persuasion
could
induce
her
to
retain
a
novice
whom
she
believed
to
be
unfitted
for
her
rule
we
women
are
not
so
easy
to
know
was
her
scornful
reply
to
the
jesuit
olea
who
held
his
judgment
in
such
matters
to
be
infallible
but
nevertheless
her
practical
soul
yearned
over
a
well
dowered
nun
when
an
excellent
novice
with
a
fortune
of
six
thousand
ducats
presented
herself
at
the
gates
in
avila
was
consumed
with
anxiety
lest
such
an
acquisition
should
through
some
blunder
be
lost
for
the
love
of
god
wrote
the
wise
old
saint
to
the
prioress
in
seville
if
she
enters
bear
with
a
few
defects
for
well
does
she
deserve
it
this
is
not
the
type
of
anecdote
which
looms
large
in
the
volumes
of
minced
saints
prepared
for
pious
readers
and
its
absence
has
accustomed
us
to
dissever
humour
from
sanctity
but
a
candid
soul
is
as
a
rule
a
humorous
soul
awake
to
the
tragi
comic
aspect
of
life
and
immaculately
free
from
self
deception
and
to
such
souls
cast
like
teresa
s
in
heroic
mould
comes
the
perception
of
great
moral
truths
together
with
the
sturdy
strength
which
supports
enthusiasm
in
the
face
of
human
disabilities
they
are
the
lantern
bearers
of
every
age
of
every

this
night
mrs
gamp
anna
robeson
burr
in
her
scholarly
analysis
of
the
world
s
great
autobiographies
has
found
occasion
to
compare
the
sufferings
of
the
american
woman
under
the
average
conditions
of
life
with
the
endurance
of
the
woman
who
three
hundred
years
ago
confronted
dire
vicissitudes
with
something
closely
akin
to
insensibility
to
day
says
mrs
burr
a
child
s
illness
an
over
gay
season
the
loss
of
an
investment
a
family
jar
these
are
accepted
as
sufficient
cause
for
over
strained
nerves
and
temporary
retirement
to
a
sanitarium
then
war
rapine
fire
sword
prolonged
and
mortal
peril
were
considered
as
furnishing
no
excuse
to
men
or
women
for
altering
the
habits
or
slackening
the
energies
of
their
daily
existence
as
a
matter
of
fact
isabella
d
este
witnessed
the
sacking
of
rome
without
so
much
as
thinking
of
nervous
prostration
this
was
nearly
four
hundred
years
ago
but
it
through
such
days
and
nights
of
horror
and
emerge
therefrom
with
unimpaired
vitality
and
unquenched
love
for
a
beautiful
and
dangerous
world
is
to
rob
the
words
shock
and
strain
of
all
dignity
and
meaning
to
resume
at
once
the
interrupted
duties
and
pleasures
of
life
was
for
the
marchioness
of
mantua
obligatory
but
none
the
less
we
marvel
that
she
could
play
her
role
so
well
a
hundred
and
the
rich
notes
of
the
woman
s
voice
swelling
into
the
midnight
air
then
i
gathered
the
rope
in
my
arms
and
sought
the
sleeping
quarters
of
my
grandfather
the
old
tiger
of
the
pathans
as
i
knew
well
was
prepared
to
be
aroused
at
any
hour
of
the
night
even
his
tulwar
was
buckled
to
his
belt
when
in
answer
to
my
summons
he
stepped
forth
into
the
outer
chamber
he
listened
to
my
eager
shaggy
eyebrows
but
not
even
the
twitching
of
a
muscle
in
his
face
betrayed
surprise
at
the
close
of
my
narrative
he
laid
a
kindly
hand
on
my
shoulder
o
son
of
my
dead
son
he
said
gravely
if
what
you
have
seen
to
night
be
not
a
dream
then
have
you
done
me
great
service
but
go
now
and
sleep
and
prepare
yourself
for
what
is
to
come
rest
assured
more
than
ever
before
that
allah
is
on
our
side
and
that
even
as
i
said
to
you
last
night
our
enemies
are
being
delivered
into
the
hollow
of
our
hands
but
sleep
still
refused
to
come
to
me
that
night
the
call
for
morning
prayer
found
me
wide
awake
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
many
perplexities
of
the
situation
had
the
quarrel
in
the
camp
of
our
adversaries
been
nothing
but
a
cunning
pretence
the
fight
among
the
tribesmen
before
the
dawn
a
mere
sham
even
the
gathering
in
of
the
supposed
all
contrived
so
that
this
devil
of
devils
mustafa
khan
should
gain
access
to
the
citadel
with
skilled
sappers
and
mining
munitions
and
was
the
youth
who
had
played
the
part
of
a
goatherd
really
a
son
of
the
man
or
a
serpent
tongued
liar
a
chosen
master
of
craft
whose
seeming
guilelessness
had
helped
to
delude
us
it
had
been
a
crude
first
idea
on
his
part
to
suggest
the
admission
as
refugees
of
a
swarm
of
armed
men
but
when
this
had
failed
there
had
been
glib
readiness
with
the
other
and
more
subtle
plan
that
had
so
nearly
succeeded
and
as
i
reflected
on
these
things
i
marked
the
young
hypocrite
for
my
own
particular
prey
during
the
morning
hours
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
two
khans
guest
and
host
betrayer
and
betrayed
walking
around
the
gardens
in
seeming
amity
but
after
a
time
my
grandsire
beckoned
me
to
his
side
this
is
a
grandson
of
mine
he
said
presenting
me
to
mustafa
khan
approaching
too
close
to
your
present
quarters
and
that
any
explosion
would
endanger
the
members
of
your
household
i
saw
the
traitor
pale
under
the
quiet
eye
of
the
tiger
of
the
pathans
there
will
be
no
explosion
to
day
he
stammered
you
seem
to
be
fully
and
precisely
acquainted
with
the
plans
of
our
enemies
nay
do
not
draw
that
sword
by
your
side
mustafa
khan
look
behind
you
man
with
haggard
face
now
mustafa
turned
round
it
was
to
see
half
a
dozen
pikes
pointed
at
his
ribs
at
a
signal
from
their
master
a
guard
had
noiselessly
drawn
near
you
know
what
to
do
jemadar
said
the
old
tiger
to
the
officer
in
charge
there
was
a
vicious
smile
now
on
his
face
such
as
i
had
never
seen
there
before
and
never
saw
again
a
savage
curling
of
the
upper
lip
that
showed
the
white
fangs
of
the
relentless
hunting
animal
and
prodded
by
the
proudly
erect
be
it
said
for
a
pathan
always
knows
how
to
die
with
dignity
and
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
nor
must
we
forget
that
he
was
a
brave
man
for
in
coming
to
the
citadel
he
had
boldly
ventured
his
life
on
a
desperate
chance
and
perfidy
in
the
game
of
war
brings
shame
only
when
it
meets
with
discomfiture
peace
be
with
his
soul
my
grandsire
and
i
were
now
alone
you
will
let
me
fight
that
crawling
snake
his
son
i
cried
with
a
gesture
of
appeal
he
is
already
carrion
for
the
vultures
was
the
reply
he
was
no
son
of
mustafa
khan
just
a
low
born
hireling
schemer
and
it
needed
only
a
prod
of
the
dagger
to
make
him
betray
the
whole
plot
and
whine
for
the
mercy
which
i
would
have
scorned
myself
to
bestow
the
two
skilled
sappers
are
still
mining
under
my
directions
this
time
we
shall
make
a
feint
of
a
sally
to
morrow
morning
outside
but
it
is
the
sabat
and
its
occupants
that
will
be
blown
into
the
sky
and
not
my
good
stout
walls
this
last
with
the
old
familiar
smile
stern
but
pleasant
to
look
upon
and
the
girl
who
sang
i
ventured
falteringly
she
is
safe
in
the
protection
of
my
home
on
her
rests
no
blame
for
in
the
part
she
played
she
was
but
obeying
her
father
s
bidding
now
that
is
all
for
the
present
keep
your
own
counsel
and
be
with
me
to
morrow
at
the
dawn
and
with
the
dawn
came
the
swarm
of
mustafa
khan
s
clansmen
running
eagerly
toward
the
opened
gateway
of
the
fort
with
their
fellow
conspirators
shouting
and
shooting
and
waving
their
swords
in
pretended
pursuit
but
just
within
the
entrance
were
ranged
a
dozen
guns
and
arquebuses
on
swivels
loaded
to
their
muzzles
with
slugs
of
iron
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
as
the
rain
of
death
mowed
down
the
onrushing
horde
fragments
of
a
hundred
bodies
blown
from
the
sabat
by
our
countermine
filled
the
air
then
indeed
did
our
men
at
arms
footmen
and
horsemen
sally
forth
to
pursue
with
sword
and
spear
their
scattered
and
dismayed
enemies
sending
scores
to
their
deaths
and
the
survivors
scampering
to
their
dens
among
the
mountains
and
none
ever
again
dared
to
attack
my
grandsire
the
tiger
of
the
pathans
with
a
proud
smile
the
afghan
surveyed
his
audience
no
one
ventured
to
question
him
yet
there
was
a
look
of
unsatisfied
curiosity
on
more
than
one
face
oh
yes
laughed
the
soldier
lightly
we
jogged
on
yes
i
had
to
say
this
looked
serious
the
fire
might
not
be
coming
smoke
certainly
was
worse
the
air
certainly
was
warmer
the
breeze
was
changing
or
else
we
were
down
into
another
breeze
next
i
saw
a
black
shaggy
creature
lumbering
past
before
and
i
pointed
without
stopping
they
nodded
bear
panted
ward
i
nodded
the
bear
was
getting
out
of
the
way
too
will
we
make
it
again
asked
ward
sure
i
answered
we
had
to
on
we
plowed
we
were
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
we
ought
to
be
reaching
those
willows
and
aspens
the
brush
was
not
so
bad
now
but
the
brush
does
not
figure
much
in
a
forest
fire
when
the
flames
leap
from
tree
top
to
tree
top
and
make
a
crown
fire
that
is
the
worst
of
all
this
was
hot
enough
to
be
a
crown
fire
if
a
breeze
helped
it
we
saw
lots
of
animals
rabbits
and
squirrels
and
porcupines
and
more
deer
and
the
birds
were
calling
and
fluttering
thick
with
it
and
with
the
smell
of
burning
pine
and
how
we
sweat
then
hurrah
we
were
into
the
aspens
i
tell
you
their
white
trunks
and
their
green
leaves
looked
good
to
me
but
ahead
of
us
was
that
other
slope
to
climb
before
we
were
into
the
bareness
shall
we
go
on
asked
scout
van
sant
he
coughed
we
all
coughed
as
we
wheezed
that
had
been
a
hard
hike
the
air
was
hot
we
could
feel
the
fire
as
the
wind
came
in
strong
puffs
everywhere
animals
were
running
and
flying
and
the
aspens
were
full
of
wild
things
panicky
we
had
to
decide
quickly
for
the
fire
was
much
closer
are
you
good
for
another
pull
i
asked
they
grinned
out
of
streaming
faces
and
white
lips
we
ll
make
it
if
you
can
but
i
did
nt
believe
that
we
could
up
i
went
into
an
aspen
to
reconnoiter
i
called
down
they
dropped
their
packs
and
scurried
chapter
xii
foiling
the
fire
i
do
nt
know
what
a
record
i
made
in
climbing
that
tree
an
aspen
s
bark
is
slick
but
in
a
jiffy
i
was
at
the
top
and
could
peer
out
note
all
the
sky
was
smoke
veiling
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
and
of
the
ridge
the
ridge
must
be
afire
the
fire
was
spreading
along
our
side
and
if
we
tried
for
the
opposite
slope
and
the
bare
spot
we
might
be
caught
halfway
something
whisked
through
the
trees
under
me
it
was
a
coyote
and
as
i
slid
down
like
lightning
thinking
hard
as
to
what
we
must
do
and
do
at
once
i
heard
a
calling
and
van
sant
and
ward
came
rushing
back
we
ve
found
a
place
they
cried
huskily
a
boggy
place
with
willows
let
s
get
in
it
we
grabbed
the
packs
i
carried
one
at
last
scout
ward
led
clustering
thick
that
was
a
good
sign
the
ground
grew
wet
and
soft
and
slushed
about
our
feet
i
tell
you
it
felt
fine
will
it
do
gasped
scout
ward
back
great
i
said
it
s
occupied
but
i
guess
we
can
squeeze
in
added
van
sant
and
sure
enough
animals
had
got
here
first
all
kinds
coyotes
rabbits
squirrels
skunks
porcupines
a
big
gray
wolf
and
a
brown
bear
and
one
or
two
things
whose
names
i
did
nt
know
but
we
did
nt
care
we
forced
right
in
to
the
very
middle
nothing
paid
much
attention
to
us
except
to
step
aside
and
give
us
room
of
course
the
coyotes
snarled
and
so
did
the
wolf
but
the
bear
simply
lay
panting
he
was
so
fat
and
we
lay
panting
too
we
were
nt
any
too
soon
the
air
was
gusty
hot
and
gusty
coolish
and
the
smoke
the
water
would
collect
and
so
that
we
could
dash
it
over
each
other
if
necessary
i
could
reach
with
my
hand
and
pet
a
rabbit
but
i
did
nt
nothing
bothered
anything
else
even
the
coyotes
and
the
wolf
let
the
rabbits
alone
this
was
a
sanctuary
there
was
a
tremendous
crashing
and
a
big
doe
elk
bolted
into
the
midst
of
us
she
was
thin
and
quivery
and
her
tongue
was
hanging
out
and
her
eyes
staring
but
she
did
nt
stay
with
another
great
bound
she
was
off
outrunning
the
fire
she
probably
knew
where
she
was
going
we
others
lay
around
flat
waiting
wish
we
were
on
her
back
gasped
van
sant
we
re
all
right
i
said
think
so
sure
i
answered
they
were
game
those
red
fox
scouts
they
never
whimpered
we
had
done
the
best
we
could
and
after
you
ve
done
the
best
you
can
there
take
it
without
kicking
as
for
me
i
was
full
of
thought
i
never
had
been
in
a
forest
fire
before
but
it
seemed
to
me
our
chances
were
good
only
i
wondered
about
general
ashley
and
fitzpatrick
in
the
hands
of
that
careless
gang
and
about
major
henry
and
jed
smith
and
kit
carson
and
about
the
beaver
man
with
the
wounded
leg
he
d
have
the
hardest
time
of
all
now
the
smoke
was
so
heavy
and
sharp
that
we
coughed
and
choked
the
air
was
scorching
we
could
hear
a
great
crackling
and
snapping
and
the
breeze
withered
the
leaves
about
us
we
burrowed
the
animals
around
us
cringed
and
burrowed
the
fire
was
upon
us
and
a
forest
fire
in
the
evergreen
country
is
terrible
there
was
a
constant
dull
roar
our
willows
swayed
and
writhed
the
rabbit
crept
right
against
me
and
lay
shivering
and
the
coyotes
whimpered
i
flattened
myself
and
so
did
the
red
fox
scouts
and
with
my
face
in
roaring
was
steady
and
the
crackling
and
snapping
was
worse
than
any
fourth
of
july
sparks
came
whisking
down
through
the
willows
and
sizzled
in
the
wetness
one
lit
on
a
coyote
he
slipped
it
into
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
big
reefer
they
walked
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
until
they
had
passed
the
end
of
the
village
and
then
hank
put
his
hand
on
the
boy
s
arm
you
ve
got
a
right
hunch
he
said
abruptly
in
a
low
voice
there
s
somethin
in
the
wind
what
makes
you
think
so
asked
colin
the
other
pointed
vaguely
to
sea
there
s
a
ship
out
there
he
said
colin
did
his
utmost
to
pierce
the
gloom
but
the
fog
had
settled
down
again
the
night
was
dark
and
the
boy
could
scarcely
see
the
waves
breaking
on
the
shore
not
twenty
feet
away
i
ca
nt
see
anything
he
said
whereabouts
i
do
nt
know
just
where
the
old
sailor
replied
but
i
know
let
s
hurry
said
the
boy
better
go
slower
warned
hank
pulling
him
back
gently
we
re
not
far
from
the
rookery
i
do
nt
see
why
we
should
be
so
careful
and
i
do
nt
see
why
we
should
whisper
colin
objected
whispering
nevertheless
the
seals
are
making
noise
enough
to
drown
a
brass
band
listen
said
hank
the
boy
put
his
hand
to
his
ear
trying
to
distinguish
sounds
in
the
continuous
roar
voices
he
queried
with
a
puzzled
look
i
thought
so
the
whaler
nodded
there
was
a
pause
while
both
listened
then
the
gunner
said
it
is
nt
english
and
it
does
nt
sound
like
aleut
or
russian
japanese
queried
the
boy
at
a
guess
the
man
grasped
the
boy
s
shoulder
with
a
grip
that
nearly
dislocated
it
japanese
raiders
he
said
can
you
run
excited
i
m
a
crack
runner
get
back
to
the
agent
s
house
as
fast
as
you
know
how
an
wake
him
up
he
ll
know
what
to
do
what
are
you
after
hank
asked
the
boy
tightening
his
belt
whatever
comes
along
was
the
terse
reply
colin
pitched
off
his
heavy
coat
and
started
it
was
over
a
half
mile
run
but
the
boy
was
in
good
condition
and
the
path
was
smooth
so
that
two
minutes
saw
him
at
the
agent
s
bedroom
door
eh
what
s
that
japanese
raiders
you
ve
been
dreaming
boy
go
back
to
bed
do
i
look
as
if
i
d
been
dreaming
colin
said
indignantly
how
do
you
suppose
i
could
run
myself
out
of
breath
in
a
dream
hank
was
with
me
he
heard
them
too
and
sent
me
back
to
tell
you
but
the
agent
was
already
up
and
busy
without
waiting
to
find
out
how
this
should
be
done
colin
started
off
at
a
run
and
picking
up
a
killing
club
that
lay
handy
he
sped
down
the
village
street
hitting
a
resounding
whack
on
every
door
as
he
passed
as
he
came
back
up
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
natives
were
streaming
out
of
their
houses
and
colin
told
them
all
to
go
to
the
agent
whereupon
those
who
understood
english
started
immediately
the
rest
following
the
agent
was
ready
and
had
all
his
plans
made
some
of
the
men
were
sent
to
the
boats
and
arms
for
others
were
laid
out
they
were
right
on
gorbatch
rookery
the
agent
asked
yes
sir
colin
replied
at
the
reef
point
end
the
party
was
swinging
along
at
a
fast
half
run
over
the
sands
that
lay
between
the
edge
of
the
village
and
the
beginning
of
the
rookery
and
with
the
rising
of
the
moon
the
fog
seemed
to
thin
before
it
gets
too
light
the
agent
said
but
we
d
better
make
the
best
use
we
can
of
our
time
on
reaching
the
wall
the
agent
vaulted
lightly
over
it
the
rest
following
suit
and
to
colin
s
surprise
the
official
led
the
way
behind
the
rookery
threading
in
and
out
between
idle
bulls
who
made
a
display
of
great
ferocity
but
never
actually
attacked
the
agent
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
to
any
of
them
merely
keeping
out
of
reach
of
their
teeth
as
they
turned
a
corner
a
cloud
which
had
partly
obscured
the
moon
passed
and
showed
them
an
unexpected
sight
magnified
into
gigantic
forms
by
the
fog
were
the
figures
of
six
men
apparently
all
armed
facing
hank
the
old
whaler
who
with
both
revolvers
was
keeping
them
at
bay
he
was
close
to
the
shore
standing
behind
two
old
wicked
looking
beachmasters
who
in
the
unnatural
light
appeared
to
be
twice
their
natural
size
hank
let
out
coming
to
his
assistance
but
he
did
not
relax
his
vigilance
i
ve
got
this
bunch
covered
he
said
an
they
ca
nt
get
to
their
boat
one
load
did
get
off
hearing
his
shout
the
invaders
turned
quickly
but
found
themselves
overpowered
for
a
dozen
rifles
were
leveled
at
them
they
knew
too
that
natives
who
are
trained
to
shoot
fur
seal
in
the
water
as
most
of
those
men
had
done
before
pelagic
sealing
was
stopped
could
be
counted
on
as
good
shots
the
agent
who
spoke
sufficient
japanese
for
simple
needs
demanded
the
surrender
of
the
raiders
and
asked
which
was
the
officer
of
the
party
this
question
they
refused
to
understand
i
suppose
he
went
off
in
the
other
boat
hazarded
the
agent
that
s
a
pity
he
stands
a
good
chance
of
being
shot
colin
looked
up
inquiringly
how
do
you
expect
to
catch
him
now
he
asked
the
fog
is
clearing
away
a
lot
the
boy

has
it
oh
i
see
now
colin
said
understandingly
you
covered
the
water
with
another
party
in
a
very
swift
gasoline
launch
we
have
while
you
were
waking
the
village
i
got
a
wireless
to
a
revenue
cutter
i
caught
her
when
the
others
were
busy
with
their
horses
his
only
reply
was
a
low
hiss
commanding
silence
a
quarter
past
the
hour
found
them
on
their
way
the
ponies
picking
their
path
gingerly
over
the
bad
ground
until
they
reached
the
range
here
the
three
rustlers
drew
up
short
for
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
the
twinkling
of
a
camp
fire
one
of
the
bar
t
punchers
said
joe
but
i
reckon
he
wo
they
walked
their
horses
and
then
urged
them
to
a
trot
in
the
direction
of
the
river
whose
tree
lined
banks
they
had
seen
late
in
the
afternoon
they
paused
only
once
in
this
place
and
then
to
cross
a
small
stream
that
lay
in
their
path
as
he
rode
larkin
worked
his
arms
cautiously
back
and
forth
until
he
felt
the
rotten
rawhide
give
and
knew
that
a
single
violent
motion
would
free
him
entirely
but
he
refrained
from
making
that
motion
feeling
certain
that
the
man
in
the
mask
would
give
the
signal
when
the
time
was
ripe
at
last
they
discerned
the
loom
of
the
trees
against
the
low
northern
sky
and
pulled
their
horses
to
a
walk
until
they
arrived
directly
underneath
a
big
cottonwood
which
stood
in
sinister
readiness
here
s
your
last
chance
said
parker
in
a
low
voice
if
you
swear
as
we
have
told
you
you
can
go
free
now
we
take
a
man
s
word
out
here
never
replied
larkin
shore
not
rejoined
the
other
we
always
grant
a
man
s
last
request
come
on
boys
let
s
finish
this
thing
quick
he
had
hardly
spoken
when
from
the
distance
came
the
sound
of
rapid
revolver
firing
mingled
with
the
wild
shouts
of
men
for
a
few
moments
the
drama
beneath
the
cottonwood
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
by
gum
cried
joe
the
bar
t
punchers
have
found
the
boys
and
there
s
the
devil
to
pay
back
there
lively
now
one
of
the
others
took
his
lariat
from
the
throng
at
the
side
of
his
saddle
and
heaved
the
coil
over
an
outstretched
limb
of
the
cottonwood
he
had
hardly
done
so
when
another
sound
reached
them
a
low
menacing
rumble
that
grew
momentarily
louder
until
it
reached
a
dull
roar
a
stampede
bawled
one
of
the
men
and
it
s
heading
this
way
joe
and
the
man
in
the
mask
still
on
their
horses
led
pinte
former
reached
down
to
take
the
noose
of
the
rope
from
the
one
who
had
arranged
it
suddenly
larkin
felt
a
hand
fumbling
with
the
rawhide
about
his
arms
and
a
low
voice
in
his
ear
whispered
now
with
the
same
motion
bud
wrenched
his
hands
free
and
dug
his
spurs
into
the
sides
of
his
horse
pinte
startled
leaped
forward
just
as
larkin
drew
the
revolver
from
his
pocket
joe
though
caught
by
surprise
did
not
let
go
of
the
bridle
that
was
wound
about
his
right
hand
but
a
blinding
shot
from
the
gun
of
the
man
in
the
mask
did
the
work
with
a
groan
parker
pitched
forward
out
of
his
saddle
and
fell
to
the
ground
just
as
larkin
fired
pointblank
at
the
third
man
who
appeared
before
him
still
on
foot
the
fellow
went
down
but
not
until
a
yellow
stab
of
light
flashed
up
from
where
he
had
been
and
bud
felt
the
wind
of
a
bullet
as
it
sped
past
his
cheek
the
fourth
man
was
and
the
man
he
had
rescued
were
now
alone
but
their
thoughts
were
fully
occupied
the
sound
of
the
distant
stampede
had
become
a
veritable
rumbling
roar
that
told
of
its
nearing
proximity
aside
from
this
drumming
of
many
feet
there
was
no
sound
for
the
animals
of
the
range
when
in
the
grip
of
panic
are
silent
with
glazed
eyes
and
muscles
strained
to
the
utmost
they
thundered
into
the
dark
unconscious
and
heedless
of
the
sure
destruction
in
their
path
it
was
as
though
thousands
of
creatures
with
their
brains
removed
had
been
turned
loose
to
run
at
will
to
the
river
cried
the
masked
man
suddenly
panic
stricken
spurring
his
horse
in
the
direction
of
the
stream
but
larkin
was
at
his
heels
and
in
a
moment
had
seized
the
other
s
bridle
and
thrown
the
horse
back
on
his
haunches
no
bawled
he
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
bank
here
is
twenty
feet
high
and
at
the
bottom
are
rocks
death
in
the
stampede
yelled
the
stranger
but
bud
would
not
yield
and
drew
the
horse
back
we
can
divide
the
herd
he
cried
come
we
have
nt
a
moment
to
lose
they
wheeled
as
one
and
dashed
out
of
the
brush
into
the
open
of
the
range
the
earth
was
now
trembling
beneath
them
and
the
pounding
feet
sounded
a
low
steady
note
ominous
with
warning
occasionally
there
was
a
revolver
shot
but
this
was
the
only
other
sound
straight
toward
the
oncoming
living
avalanche
the
two
men
rode
until
they
had
left
an
open
space
a
hundred
yards
wide
behind
them
then
they
pulled
up
short
and
dismounted
now
out
of
the
threatening
thunder
sounded
a
single
individual
note
the
rapid
beating
of
a
horse
s
feet
some
horse
that
was
bearing
a
desperate
rider
ahead
of
the
stampede
but
powerless
to
avoid
it
instantly
larkin
saw
the
picture
of
the
yawning
precipice
toward
which
the
frantic
rider
was
hurrying
at
breakneck
speed
he
raised
was
instantly
acted
on
for
in
another
moment
a
lathering
heaving
pony
dashed
up
to
them
and
the
rider
leaped
to
the
ground
oh
what
shall
i
do
hello
who
are
you
cried
a
female
voice
and
larkin
s
heart
leaped
as
though
it
had
turned
over
in
its
place
juliet
he
cried
seizing
the
girl
with
one
arm
and
drawing
her
close
bud
for
an
instant
she
clung
to
him
lead
the
horses
together
and
shoot
them
he
ordered
although
the
others
could
scarcely
hear
him
every
instant
was
priceless
now
to
be
even
gently
sarcastic
after
the
exalted
revelation
he
had
made
of
himself
thank
you
she
said
quietly
and
turned
her
face
and
smiled
at
the
now
steel
blue
reaches
of
the
river
he
dropped
in
several
evenings
to
see
her
when
he
was
in
an
idealistic
mood
she
was
warmly
responsive
when
he
and
raillery
and
at
such
times
she
was
as
elusive
as
baffling
as
exasperating
as
a
sprite
on
occasions
when
he
rather
insistently
asked
her
plans
and
her
progress
in
her
father
s
case
she
evaded
him
and
held
him
at
bay
she
felt
that
he
admired
her
but
with
a
grudging
unwilling
admiration
that
left
his
fundamental
disapproval
of
her
quite
unshaken
the
more
she
saw
of
this
dogmatic
dreamer
this
erratic
man
of
action
the
more
she
liked
him
the
more
she
found
really
admirable
in
him
but
mixed
with
her
admiration
was
an
alert
and
pugnacious
fear
so
big
was
he
so
powerful
so
violently
hostile
to
all
the
principles
involved
in
her
belief
that
the
whole
wide
world
of
action
should
in
justice
lie
as
much
open
to
woman
to
choose
from
as
to
man
without
cessation
katherine
kept
eyes
and
mind
on
blake
she
searched
out
and
pondered
over
the
thousand
possible
details
and
ramifications
his
conspiracy
might
have
no
human
plan
was
a
perfect
plan
chance
that
she
might
discover
one
detail
one
slip
one
oversight
that
would
give
her
the
key
to
the
case
one
of
the
thousand
possibilities
was
that
he
had
an
active
partner
in
his
scheme
since
no
such
partner
was
visible
in
the
open
it
was
likely
that
his
associate
was
a
man
with
whom
blake
wished
to
have
seemingly
no
relations
were
this
conjecture
true
then
naturally
he
would
meet
this
confederate
in
secret
she
began
to
think
upon
all
possible
means
and
places
of
holding
secret
conferences
such
a
meeting
might
be
held
there
in
westville
in
the
dead
of
night
it
might
be
held
in
any
large
city
in
which
individuals
might
lose
themselves
indianapolis
louisville
cincinnati
chicago
it
might
be
held
at
any
appointed
spot
within
the
radius
of
an
automobile
journey
katherine
analyzed
every
possible
place
of
this
last
possibility
she
began
to
watch
as
she
watched
other
possibilities
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
blake
automobile
it
occurred
to
her
that
if
anything
at
night
and
then
a
little
later
it
occurred
to
her
to
make
a
certain
regular
observation
the
blake
garage
and
the
west
stable
stood
side
by
side
and
opened
into
the
same
alley
every
evening
while
blake
s
car
was
being
cleaned
if
it
had
been
in
use
during
the
day
katherine
went
out
to
say
good
night
to
her
saddle
horse
and
as
she
was
on
friendly
terms
with
blake
s
man
she
contrived
while
exchanging
a
word
with
him
to
read
the
mileage
record
of
the
speedometer
this
observation
she
carried
on
with
no
higher
hope
of
anything
resulting
from
it
than
from
any
of
a
score
of
other
measures
it
was
merely
one
detail
of
her
all
embracing
vigilance
every
night
she
sat
on
watch
the
evening
s
earlier
half
usually
in
the
rustic
summer
house
in
the
backyard
the
latter
part
at
her
bedroom
window
one
night
after
most
of
westville
was
in
bed
her
long
patient
vigil
was
rewarded
by
seeing
the
blake
automobile
slip
out
with
a
single
streets
of
the
town
hours
passed
and
still
she
sat
wide
eyed
at
her
window
it
was
not
till
raucous
old
muzzains
of
roosters
raised
from
the
watch
towers
of
their
various
coops
their
concatenated
prophecy
of
the
dawn
that
she
saw
the
machine
return
with
its
single
passenger
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
she
saw
blake
s
man
stirring
about
his
work
she
slipped
out
to
her
stable
watching
her
chance
she
got
a
glimpse
of
blake
s
speedometer
then
she
quickly
slipped
back
to
her
room
and
sat
there
in
excited
thought
the
evening
before
the
mileage
had
read
this
morning
the
reading
was
blake
in
his
furtive
midnight
journey
had
travelled
twenty
two
miles
if
he
had
slipped
forth
to
meet
a
secret
ally
then
evidently
their
place
of
meeting
was
half
of
twenty
two
miles
distant
where
was
this
rendezvous
almost
instantly
she
thought
of
the
sycamores
that
fitted
the
requirements
exactly
it
was
eleven
miles
distant
blake
had
a
cabin
there
the
place
was
be
safer
than
for
two
men
coming
in
different
vehicles
from
different
points
perhaps
to
meet
at
that
retired
spot
at
such
an
eyeless
hour
perhaps
there
was
no
confederate
perhaps
blake
s
night
trip
was
not
to
a
secret
conference
perhaps
the
sycamores
was
not
the
rendezvous
but
there
was
a
chance
that
all
three
of
these
conjectures
were
correct
and
if
so
there
was
a
chance
aye
more
a
probability
that
there
would
be
further
midnight
trysts
bruce
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
dropping
in
occasionally
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
an
evening
s
speaking
to
tell
katherine
how
matters
seemed
to
be
progressing
when
he
called
that
night
toward
ten
he
was
surprised
to
be
directed
around
to
the
summer
house
his
surprise
was
all
the
more
because
the
three
months
drought
had
that
afternoon
been
broken
and
the
rain
was
now
driving
down
in
gusts
and
there
was
a
far
rumbling
of
thunder
that
threatened
a
nearer
and
a
fiercer
cannonading
crouching
beneath
his
the
summer
house
in
which
he
saw
sitting
a
dim
solitary
figure
in
mercy
s
name
what
are
you
doing
out
here
he
demanded
as
he
entered
watching
the
rain
i
love
to
be
out
in
a
storm
every
clap
of
thunder
sent
a
shiver
through
her
you
must
go
right
into
the
house
he
commanded
you
ll
get
wet
i
ll
bet
you
re
soaked
already
oh
no
i
have
a
raincoat
on
she
answered
calmly
i
m
going
to
stay
and
watch
the
storm
a
little
had
quarreled
three
years
before
of
this
money
trouble
from
which
colonel
fairfax
had
shielded
her
she
must
as
yet
know
nothing
and
there
was
no
turkey
for
the
christmas
dinner
verily
things
looked
dark
for
the
ill
fated
job
roosting
in
unsuspecting
security
in
the
desolate
old
barn
with
bowed
head
the
darky
walked
slowly
toward
the
door
uncle
noah
the
colonel
s
tones
were
incisive

the

nodded
carefully
avoiding
the
old
man
s
troubled
eyes
and
went
to
join
his
wife
at
supper
christmas
eve
my
dear
he
announced
cheerfully
as
he
bent
to
kiss
the
sweet
wistful
face
that
for
keeping
you
waiting
uncle
noah
and
i
were
discussing
to
morrow
s
turkey
he
gazed
calmly
at
the
old
negro
nervously
handling
the
tea
things
he
has
selected
a
large
bird
and
i
have
been
advising
a
smaller
the
colonel
opened
his
napkin
and
deftly
tucked
the
hole
in
the
end
out
of
sight
beneath
the
table
now
uncle
noah
what
is
there
to
night
for
supper
to
uncle
noah
this
nightly
question
had
become
a
sacred
institution
a
stimulus
to
imaginative
powers
highly
developed
in
his
quaint
dialogues
with
the
colonel
he
forgot
the
doomed
job
it
was
christmas
eve
and
his
creative
gift
took
festive
wings
well
sah
he
beamed
we
has
a

right
golden
brown
sah

and
baked

colonel
fairfax
thoughtfully
considered
the
appetizing
prospect
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
game
what
mattered
it
that
the
luscious
edibles
the
little
pretense
gave
to
each
a
delightful
thrill
surely
an
adequate
extenuation
of
the
harmless
diversion
as
usual
colonel
fairfax
found
the
key
to
the
situation
in
the
closing
items
of
uncle
noah
s
list
it
all
sounds
delicious
uncle
noah
he
observed
graciously
but
i
have
a
touch
of
my
old
enemy
the
dyspepsia
today
i
think
i
shall
have
sliced
ham
and
baked
potatoes
that
i
think
will
do
for
us
both
mrs
fairfax
agreed
her
kindly
eyes
fixed
upon
uncle
noah
s
attentive
face
and
sah
uncle
noah
began
it
was
christmas
eve
and
this
game

be
perfectly
played

attend

negroes
quarters
sah
yes
agreed
the
colonel
see
that
no
one
is
slighted
mrs
fairfax
bowed
her
wistful
face
upon
her
hands
to
hide
the
blinding
tears
and
an
odd
uncomfortable
silence
fell
upon
the
little
group
at
length
the
colonel
pushed
his
he
said
sternly
a
suspicious
brightness
gleaming
in
his
eyes
that
turkey
of
yours
is
making
a
terrible
noise
under
the
window
make
him
quit
gobbling
patricia
i
do
nt
wonder
he
makes
you
nervous
he
s
an
old
renegade
that
the
object
of
the
colonel
s
wrath
had
long
since
retired
to
roost
mattered
not
to
his
accuser
the
turkey
had
developed
a
convenient
habit
of
gobbling
under
the
window
whenever
emotion
forced
the
colonel
to
seek
a
vent
in
stern
commands
uncle
noah
crossed
to
the
window
and
commanded
job
to
be
silent
mrs
fairfax
southern
gentlewoman
and
thoroughbred
from
tip
to
toe
quivered
proudly
and
as
uncle
noah
returned
bade
him
serve
the
supper
in
tones
as
well
controlled
as
they
were
gentle
ii
the
inspiration
ii
in
the
great
barren
kitchen
uncle
noah
wiped
his
steel
rimmed
spectacles
and
glared
angrily
about
him
ol
missus
grievin
her
heart
out
foh
young
massa

he
reflected
and
de

say

ol

massa
dick
colonel
say
job

the
old
darky
choked
miserably
at
the
thought
of
the
destined
check
to
job
s
gobbling
career
and
replacing
his
spectacles
carefully
carried
in
the
supper
prolonging
its
simple
service
to
the
uttermost
with
the
single
idea
of
adding
precious
minutes
to
the
doomed
turkey
s
span
of
life
when
at
length
he
sought
the
barn
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
velvet
stillness
of
the
night
was
dotted
thickly
with
snowflakes
with
trembling
fingers
he
opened
the
great
barn
door
lit
a
queer
old
lantern
hanging
just
within
and
hung
it
high
upon
a
projecting
hook
the
dim
light
revealed
an
antique
carriage
house
in
one
corner
of
which
upon
a
rude
improvised
roost
of
shingles
the
tyrant
job
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
and
the
unjust
rolled
into
one
as
the
lights
flickered
upon
his
ruffled
feathers
the
turkey
emitted
a
throaty
grunt
of
disapproval
and
moved
cumbrously
around
to
avoid
the
light
see
yere
massa
job
he
said
tai

no

puttin
on
yoh
high
and
mighty
airs

i
se
come
to
interview

job
majestically
tucked
his
head
beneath
his
wing
as
if
to
intimate
his
indifference
to
the
proposed
interview
uncle
noah
surveyed
his
ruffled
back
feathers
with
increased
respect
so
he
said
yoh
refuse
me
an
interview
massa

fairfax
yoh
is
sleepy
sah
dat
s
whut

got
into

he
stroked
the
turkey
with
a
gentle
hand
and
job
resenting
the
indignity
withdrew
his
head
from
the
sheltering
wing
and
pecked
at
the
brown
fingers
turning
around
with
a
stately
movement
and
facing
the
light
once
more
with
a
sleepy
blink
of
his
bright
beadlike
eyes
now
sah
we
can
talk
exclaimed
the
negro
in
delight
drawing
up
an
old
box
he
seated
himself
before
the
roost
and
beamed
benevolently
over
his
glasses
colonel

he
began
confidentially
when
ol
mis

as

the

held
his
head
upon
one
side
apparently
i
ll
break
you
for
this
cassidy
he
declared
fiercely
why
did
nt
you
get
here
on
the
run
when
you
heard
the
shot
but
there
was
nt
any
shot
the
perplexed
and
alarmed
detective
expostulated
he
fairly
stuttered
in
the
earnestness
of
his
self
defense
i
tell
you
chief
there
has
nt
been
a
sound
burke
rose
to
his
feet
his
heavy
face
was
set
in
its
sternest
mold
you
could
drive
a
hearse
through
the
hole
they
ve
made
in
him
he
rumbled
he
wheeled
on
mary
and
dick
so
he
shouted
now
it
s
murder
well
hand
it
over
where
s
the
gun
followed
a
moment
s
pause
then
the
inspector
spoke
harshly
to
cassidy
he
still
felt
himself
somewhat
dazed
by
this
extraordinary
event
but
he
was
able
to
cope
with
the
order
search
him
before
the
detective
could
obey
the
direction
dick
took
the
revolver
from
his
pocket
where
he
had
bestowed
it
and
held
it
out
and
it
so
chanced
that
at
this
incriminating
crisis
for
the
son
the
father
hastily
strode
within
the
library
he
had
been
aroused
by
the
inspector
s
shouting
and
was
evidently
greatly
perturbed
his
usual
dignified
air
was
marred
by
a
patent
alarm
what
s
all
this
he
exclaimed
as
he
halted
and
stared
doubtfully
on
the
scene
before
him
burke
in
a
moment
like
this
was
no
respecter
of
persons
for
all
his
judicious
attentions
on
other
occasions
to
those
whose
influence
might
serve
him
well
for
benefits
received
you
can
see
for
yourself
he
said
grimly
to
the
dumfounded
magnate
then
he
fixed
sinister
eyes
on
the
son
so
he
went
on
with
somber
menace
in
his
voice
you
did
it
young
man
he
nodded
toward
the
em
both
down
town
that
s
all
the
command
aroused
dick
to
remonstrance
against
such
indignity
toward
the
woman
whom
he
loved
not
her
he
cried
imploringly
you
do
nt
want
her
inspector
this
is
all
wrong
now
at
last
mary
interposed
with
a
new
spirit
she
had
regained
in
some
measure
at
least
her
poise
she
was
speaking
again
with
that
mental
clarity
which
was
distinctive
in
her
dick
she
advised
quietly
but
with
underlying
urgency
in
her
gently
spoken
words
do
nt
talk
please
burke
laughed
harshly
what
do
you
expect
he
inquired
truculently
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
thing
s
simple
enough
young
man
either
you
killed
griggs
or
she
did
the
inspector
with
his
charge
made
a
careless
gesture
toward
the
corpse
of
the
murdered
stool
pigeon
for
the
first
time
edward
gilder
as
his
glance
unconsciously
followed
the
officer
of
flesh
and
bone
that
had
once
been
a
man
he
fairly
reeled
at
the
gruesome
spectacle
then
fumbled
with
an
outstretched
hand
as
he
moved
stumblingly
until
he
laid
hold
on
a
chair
into
which
he
sank
helplessly
it
suddenly
smote
upon
his
consciousness
that
he
felt
very
old
and
broken
he
marveled
dully
over
the
sensation
it
was
wholly
new
to
him
then
soon
from
a
long
way
off
he
heard
the
strident
voice
of
the
inspector
remorselessly
continuing
in
the
vile
the
impossible
accusation
and
that
grotesque
accusation
was
hurled
against
his
only
son
the
boy
whom
he
so
loved
the
thing
was
monstrous
a
thing
incredible
this
whole
seeming
was
no
more
than
a
chimera
of
the
night
a
phantom
of
bad
dreams
with
no
truth
under
it
yet
the
stern
voice
of
the
official
came
with
a
strange
semblance
of
reality
either
you
killed
him
the
voice
repeated
gratingly
or
she
did
well
then
young
man
no
dick
shouted
aghast
then
it
was
you
such
was
the
inspector
s
summary
of
the
case
mary
s
words
came
frantically
once
again
she
was
become
desperate
over
the
course
of
events
in
this
night
of
fearful
happenings
no
no
he
did
nt
burke
s
rasping
voice
reiterated
the
accusation
with
a
certain
complacency
in
the
inevitability
of
the
dilemma
one
of
you
killed
griggs
which
one
of
you
did
it
he
scowled
at
dick
did
she
kill
him
again
the
husband
s
cry
came
with
the
fierceness
of
despair
over
the
fate
of
the
woman
i
told
you
no
the
inspector
always
savagely
impressive
now
in
voice
and
look
and
gesture
faced
the
girl
with
saturnine
persistence
well
then
he
blustered
did
he
kill
him
the
nod
of
his
head
was
toward
dick
then
as
she
remained
silent
i
m
talking
to
him
the
reply
came
with
a
soft
distinctness
that
was
like
a
crash
of
destiny
yes
dick
turned
to
his
wife
in
reproachful
amazement
mary
he
cried
incredulously
this
betrayal
was
something
inconceivable
from
her
since
he
believed
that
now
at
last
he
knew
her
heart
burke
however
as
usual
paid
no
heed
to
the
niceties
of
sentiment
they
had
small
place
in
his
concerns
as
an
official
of
police
his
sole
ambition
just
now
was
to
fix
the
crime
definitely
on
the
perpetrator
you
ll
swear
he
killed
him
he
asked
briskly
well
content
with
this
concrete
result
of
the
entanglement
mary
subtly
evaded
the
question
while
seeming
to
give
unqualified
assent
why
not
she
responded
listlessly
at
this
intolerable
assertion
as
he
deemed
it
edward
gilder
was
reanimated
he
sat
rigidly
erect
in
his
chair
in
that
frightful
moment
it
came
to
him
anew
that
here
was
in
verity
the
last
detail
himself
god
he
cried
despairingly
and
that
s
your
vengeance
mary
heard
and
understood
there
came
an
inscrutable
smile
on
her
curving
lips
but
there
was
no
satisfaction
in
that
smile
as
of
one
who
realized
the
fruition
of
long
cherished
schemes
of
retribution
instead
there
was
only
an
infinite
sadness
while
she
spoke
very
gently
i
do
nt
want
vengeance
now
she
said
but
they
ll
try
my
boy
for
murder
the
magnate
remonstrated
distraught
oh
no
they
ca
nt
came
the
rejoinder
and
now
once
again
there
was
a
hint
of
the
quizzical
creeping
in
the
smile
no
they
ca
nt
she
repeated
of
such
contemplative
exercise
as
the
very
considerable
distance
for
small
legs
between
those
regions
and
the
westward
fourteenth
street
might
comprise
pedestrian
gaping
having
been
in
childhood
as
i
have
noted
prevailingly
my
line
fate
appeared
to
have
kindly
provided
for
it
on
no
small
scale
to
the
extent
even
that
it
must
have
been
really
my
sole
and
single
form
of
enclosed
union
square
would
seem
to
point
a
little
among
us
all
to
nobler
types
of
motion
but
of
any
basis
for
recreation
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
playground
or
a
breathing
space
the
institution
itself
was
serenely
innocent
this
i
take
again
for
a
note
extraordinarily
mediaeval
it
occupied
the
first
and
second
floors
if
i
rightly
remember
of
a
wide
front
that
overhanging
the
endless
thoroughfare
looked
out
on
bouncing
clattering
stages
and
painfully
dragged
carts
and
the
promiscuous
human
shuffle
the
violence
of
repercussions
from
the
new
york
pavement
of
those
years
to
be
further
taken
into
account
and
i
win
it
back
from
every
side
as
in
spite
of
these
aspects
of
garish
publicity
a
dark
and
dreadful
and
withal
quite
absurd
scene
i
see
places
of
that
general
time
even
places
of
confinement
in
a
dusty
golden
light
that
special
memories
of
small
misery
scarce
in
the
least
bedim
and
this
holds
true
of
our
next
and
quite
neighbouring
refuge
the
a
sordidly
black
interior
is
my
main
image
for
it
attenuated
only
by
its
having
very
soon
afterwards
as
a
suffered
ordeal
altogether
lapsed
and
intermitted
faintly
in
the
gloom
i
distinguish
m
vergnes
himself
quite
old
very
old
indeed
as
i
supposed
him
and
highly
irritated
and
markedly
bristling
though
of
nothing
in
particular
that
happened
to
me
at
his
or
at
anyone
s
else
hands
have
i
the
scantest
remembrance
what
really
most
happened
no
doubt
was
that
my
brother
and
i
should
both
come
away
with
a
mind
prepared
for
a
perfect
assimilation
of
alphonse
daudet
s
chronicle
of
jack
years
and
years
later
on
to
make
the
acquaintance
in
that
work
of
the
petits
pays
chauds
among
whom
jack
learnt
the
first
lessons
of
life
was
to
see
the
institution
vergnes
at
once
revive
swarming
as
it
did
with
small
homesick
cubans
and
mexicans
the
complete
failure
of
blondness
that
marks
the
memory
is
doubtless
the
cumulative
effect
of
so
many
of
the
new
black
and
conducing
to
a
greasy
gloom
into
this
gloom
i
fear
i
should
see
all
things
recede
together
but
for
a
certain
salient
note
the
fact
that
the
whole
staff
appears
to
have
been
constantly
in
a
rage
from
which
naturally
resulted
the
accent
of
shrillness
the
only
accent
we
could
pick
up
though
we
were
supposed
to
be
learning
for
the
extreme
importance
of
it
quantities
of
french
and
the
sound
of
high
vociferation
i
remember
infuriated
ushers
of
foreign
speech
and
flushed
complexion
the
tearing
across
of
hapless
exercises
and
dictees
and
the
hurtle
through
the
air
of
dodged
volumes
only
never
despite
this
the
extremity
of
smiting
there
can
have
been
at
the
institution
no
blows
instructionally
dealt
nor
even
from
our
hours
of
ease
do
any
such
echoes
come
back
to
me
little
cubans
and
mexicans
i
make
out
were
not
to
be
vulgarly
whacked
in
deference
presumably
to
some
latent
relic
or
imputed
survival
of
castilian
pride
which
for
reflection
and
comparison
might
well
have
been
so
suggested
interesting
at
least
the
element
of
contrast
between
such
opposed
conceptions
of
tone
temper
and
manner
as
the
passion
without
whacks
or
with
whacks
only
of
inanimate
objects
ruling
the
scene
i
have
described
and
the
whacks
without
passion
the
grim
impersonal
strictly
penal
applications
of
the
rod
which
then
generally
represented
what
was
still
involved
in
our
english
tradition
it
was
the
two
theories
of
sensibility
of
personal
dignity
that
so
diverged
but
with
such
other
divergences
now
on
top
of
those
that
the
old
comparison
falls
away
we
to
day
go
unwhacked
altogether
though
from
a
pride
other
than
castilian
it
is
difficult
to
say
at
least
what
ideal
has
thus
triumphed
in
the
vergnes
air
at
any
rate
i
seem
myself
to
have
sat
unscathed
and
unterrified
not
alarmed
even
by
so
much
as
a
call
to
the
blackboard
only
protected
by
my
insignificance
which
yet
covered
such
a
sense
of
our
dusky
squalor
queer
for
us
the
the
poor
petits
pays
chauds
who
had
come
so
far
for
their
privilege
we
had
come
comparatively
but
from
round
the
corner
and
that
left
the
state
of
education
and
the
range
of
selection
all
about
as
quaint
enough
what
could
these
things
then
have
been
in
the
various
native
climes
of
the
petits
pays
chauds
it
was
by
some
strong
wave
of
reaction
clearly
that
we
were
floated
next
into
the
quieter
haven
of
mr
richard
pulling
jenks
where
cleaner
waters
as
i
feel
their
coolness
still
must
have
filled
a
neater
though
it
was
true
slightly
more
contracted
trough
yet
the
range
of
selection
had
been
even
on
this
higher
plane
none
too
strikingly
exemplified
our
jumping
had
scant
compass
we
still
grubbed
with
a
good
conscience
in
broadway
and
sidled
about
fourth
street
but
i
think
of
the
higher
education
as
having
there
from
various
causes
none
the
less
begun
to
glimmer
for
us
a
diffused
brightness
a
kind
of
high
crosslight
of
conflicting
windows
realm
of
mr
pulling
jenks
and
bathes
it
as
with
positively
sweet
limitations
limited
must
it
have
been
i
feel
with
our
couple
of
middling
rooms
front
and
back
our
close
packing
our
large
unaccommodating
stove
our
grey
and
gritty
oilcloth
and
again
our
importunate
broadway
from
the
aggregation
of
which
elements
there
distils
itself
without
my
being
able
to
account
for
it
a
certain
perversity
of
romance
i
speak
indeed
here
for
myself
in
particular
and
keen
for
romance
must
i
have
been
in
such
conditions
i
admit
since
the
sense
of
it
had
crept
into
a
recreational
maurice
levy
s
constitution
lo
sam
said
maurice
cautiously
what
you
doin
penrod
at
that
instant
had
a
singular
experience
an
intellectual
shock
like
a
flash
of
fire
in
the
brain
sitting
in
darkness
a
great
light
flooded
him
with
wild
brilliance
he
gasped
what
you
doin
repeated
mr
levy
penrod
sprang
to
his
feet
seized
the
licorice
bottle
shook
it
with
stoppering
thumb
and
took
a
long
drink
with
histrionic
unction
what
you
doin
asked
maurice
for
the
third
time
sam
williams
not
having
decided
upon
a
reply
it
was
penrod
who
answered
drinkin
lickrish
water
he
said
simply
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
such
delicious
enjoyment
that
sam
s
jaded
thirst
was
instantly
stimulated
he
took
the
bottle
eagerly
from
penrod
a
a
h
exclaimed
penrod
smacking
his
lips
eyes
above
the
fence
glistened
ask
him
if
he
do
nt
want
some
penrod
whispered
urgently
quit
drinkin
it
it
s
no
good
any
more
ask
him
what
for
demanded
the
practical
sam
go
on
and
ask
him
whispered
penrod
fiercely
say
m
rice
sam
called
waving
the
bottle
want
some
bring
it
here
mr
levy
requested
come
on
over
and
get
some
returned
sam
being
prompted
i
ca
nt
penrod
schofield
s
after
me
no
i

said
penrod
reassuringly
i
wo
nt
touch
you

i
made
up
with
you
yesterday
afternoon
do
nt
you
remember
you
re
all
right
with
me
m
rice
maurice
looked
undecided
but
penrod
had
the
delectable
bottle
again
and
tilting
it
above
his
lips
affected
to
let
the
cool
liquid
purl
enrichingly
into
him
while
with
maurice
s
mouth
watered
here
cried
sam
stirred
again
by
the
superb
manifestations
of
his
friend
gim
me
that
penrod
brought
the
bottle
down
surprisingly
full
after
so
much
gusto
but
withheld
it
from
sam
and
the
two
scuffled
for
its
possession
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
so
worked
upon
the
desire
of
the
yearning
observer
beyond
the
fence
honest
penrod
you
ai
nt
goin
to
touch
me
if
i
come
in
your
yard
he
called
honest
cross
my
heart
answered
penrod
holding
the
bottle
away
from
sam
and
we
ll
let
you
drink
all
you
want
maurice
hastily
climbed
the
fence
and
while
he
was
thus
occupied
mr
samuel
williams
received
a
great
enlightenment
with
startling
rapidity
penrod
standing
just
outside
the
storeroom
door
extended
his
arm
within
the
room
deposited
the
licorice
water
upon
the
counter
of
the
drug
store
seized
in
its
stead
the
bottle
of
smallpox
medicine
is
like
that
great
simple
broad
strokes
dazzled
mr
samuel
williams
leaned
against
the
wall
he
had
the
sensations
of
one
who
comes
suddenly
into
the
presence
of
a
chef
d
oeuvre
perhaps
his
first
coherent
thought
was
that
almost
universal
one
on
such
huge
occasions
why
could
nt
i
have
done
that
sam
might
have
been
even
more
dazzled
had
he
guessed
that
he
figured
not
altogether
as
a
spectator
in
the
sweeping
and
magnificent
conception
of
the
new
talleyrand
sam
had
no
partner
for
the
cotillon
if
maurice
was
to
be
absent
from
that
festivity
as
it
began
to
seem
he
might
be
penrod
needed
a
male
friend
to
take
care
of
miss
rennsdale
and
he
believed
he
saw
his
way
to
compel
mr
williams
to
be
that
male
friend
for
this
he
relied
largely
upon
the
prospective
conduct
of
miss
rennsdale
when
he
should
get
the
matter
before
her
he
was
inclined
to
believe
she
would
favour
the
exchange
as
for
talleyrand
penrod
himself
he
was
going
to
dance
that
cotillon
can
drink
at
one
pull
m
rice
said
penrod
kindly
you
said
i
could
have
all
i
want
protested
maurice
reaching
for
the
bottle
no
i
did
nt
returned
penrod
quickly
holding
it
away
from
the
eager
hand
he
did
too
did
nt
he
sam
sam
could
not
reply
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
bottle
protruded
strangely
you
heard
him
did
nt
you
sam
well
if
i
did
say
it
i
did
nt
mean
it
said
penrod
hastily
quoting
from
one
of
the
authorities
looky
here
m
rice
he
continued
assuming
a
more
placative
and
reasoning
tone
that
would
nt
be
fair
to
us
i
guess
we
want
some
of
our
own
lickrish
water
do
nt
we
the
bottle
ai
nt
much
over
two
thirds
full
anyway
what
i
meant
was
you
can
have
all
you
can
drink
at
one
pull
how
do
you
can
gulp
all
you
want
so
long
as
you
keep
swallering
but
you
ca
nt
take
the
bottle
out
of
your
mouth
and
commence
again
soon
s
you
quit
swallering
it
s
sam
s
turn
no
you
can
have
next
penrod
said
sam
well
anyway
i
mean
m
rice
has
to
give
the
bottle
up
the
minute
he
stops
swallering
craft
appeared
upon
the
face
of
maurice
like
a
poster
pasted
on
a
wall
i
can
drink
so
long
i
do
nt
stop
swallering
yes
that
s
it
all
right
he
cried
gim
me
the
bottle
and
penrod
placed
it
in
his
hand
you
promise
to
let
me
drink
until
i
quit
swallering
maurice
insisted
yes
said
both
boys
together
with
that
maurice
placed
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
began
to
drink
penrod
and
sam
leaned
forward
in
breathless
excitement
they
had
feared
maurice
might
smell
past
this
was
the
crucial
moment
their
fondest
hope
was
that
he
would
make
his
first
swallow
a
voracious
one
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
a
second
they
expected
one
big
gulping
swallow
and
then
an
explosion
with
fountain
effects
little
they
knew
the
mettle
of
their
man
maurice
swallowed
once
he
swallowed
twice
and
thrice
and
he
continued
to
swallow
no
adam
s
apple
was
sculptured
on
that
juvenile
throat
but
the
internal
progress
of
the
liquid
was
not
a
whit
the
less
visible
his
eyes
gleamed
with
cunning
and
malicious
triumph
sidewise
at
the
stunned
conspirators
he
was
fulfilling
the
conditions
of
the
draught
not
once
breaking
the
thread
of
that
marvelous
swallering
his
gentlemen
hum
and
he
never
once
spoke
of
his
discomfort
on
the
long
hot
road
though
a
hay
camp
is
subject
to
most
singular
mishaps
i
i
have
often
of
charming
humor
a
superlative
grain
of
humor
perhaps
and
he
s
very
lazy
and
fine
and
frank
and
honorable
one
may
not
forget
arcadia
and
the
rake
of
twigs
one
may
not
forget
that
is
very
true
but
he
seeks
to
make
himself
out
such
a
very
great
fool
he
cloaks
each
generous
instinct
with
a
laughing
drollery
why
did
you
hum
when
you
cooked
his
supper
and
called
to
him
through
the
trees
i
i
do
not
know
t
was
the
world
old
instinct
of
primitive
woman
no
no
no
it
was
only
because
i
was
living
the
life
i
love
the
best
i
was
very
happy
why
were
you
happier
after
the
storm
i
i
do
not
know
you
have
scolded
with
flashing
eyes
about
the
hay
camp
but
i
i
did
not
mind
i
tried
to
mind
and
could
not
that
is
a
very
singular
thing
yes
tall
sentinel
you
have
furtively
watched
of
moonlit
nights
among
the
trees
a
sentinel
who
slept
by
day
upon
a
ridiculous
bed
of
hay
that
he
might
smoke
and
watch
over
the
camp
of
his
lady
until
peep
o
day
i
do
not
know
you
are
sighing
even
now
for
the
van
and
a
camp
fire
for
the
hay
camp
through
the
trees
no
with
a
very
definite
flash
of
perversity
where
is
this
persistent
young
nomad
of
the
hay
camp
anyway
i
i
have
wondered
myself
but
with
a
quiver
of
impatience
the
horse
had
pawed
the
ground
and
the
tiny
bird
flew
off
to
a
distant
clump
of
palmetto
diane
rode
hurriedly
off
into
the
flat
woods
chapter
xxviii
the
nomad
of
the
fire
wheel
it
had
been
an
unforgettable
day
this
day
in
the
pine
woods
diane
had
forded
shallow
streams
and
followed
bright
winged
birds
lunched
by
a
silver
lake
set
coolly
in
the
darkling
shade
of
cypress
and
found
a
curious
nest
in
the
stump
of
a
tree
now
her
saddle
she
was
riding
slowly
back
through
the
pine
woods
though
the
sun
which
awhile
back
had
filled
the
hollow
of
palmetto
fronds
with
a
ruddy
pool
of
light
had
long
since
dropped
behind
the
horizon
the
girl
somehow
picked
the
homeward
trail
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
a
wild
thing
that
one
may
be
hopelessly
lost
in
the
deceptive
flatwoods
she
dismissed
with
a
laugh
the
wood
is
kind
to
wild
things
it
was
quite
dark
when
through
the
trees
ahead
she
caught
the
curious
glimmer
of
a
cart
wheel
of
flame
upon
the
ground
hub
and
spokes
glowing
vividly
in
the
center
of
a
clearing
curiously
the
girl
rode
toward
it
unaware
that
the
picturesque
fire
wheel
ahead
was
the
typical
camp
fire
of
the
southern
indian
or
that
the
strange
wild
figure
squatting
gravely
by
the
fire
in
lonely
silhouette
against
the
white
of
a
canvas
covered
wagon
beyond
in
the
trees
was
a
vagrant
seminole
from
the
proud
old
turbaned
tribe
who
still
dwell
in
the
inaccessible
morasses
of
the
everglades
the
realization
came
in
florida
indian
harmed
no
one
he
still
considered
himself
proudly
hostile
to
the
white
man
wherefore
diane
wisely
wheeled
her
horse
about
to
retreat
it
was
too
late
already
the
young
seminole
was
upon
his
feet
keen
of
vision
and
hearing
for
all
he
seemed
but
a
tense
still
statue
in
the
wildwood
accepting
the
situation
with
good
grace
diane
rode
fearlessly
toward
his
fire
and
reined
in
her
horse
but
the
ready
word
of
greeting
froze
upon
her
lips
for
the
nomad
of
the
fire
wheel
was
a
girl
tall
and
slender
barbarically
arrayed
in
the
holiday
garb
of
a
seminole
chief
the
firelight
danced
upon
the
beaten
band
of
silver
about
her
brilliant
turban
and
the
beads
upon
her
sash
upon
red
beaded
deerskin
leggings
delicately
thonged
from
the
supple
waist
to
the
small
and
moccasined
foot
upon
a
tunic
elaborately
banded
in
red
and
a
belt
of
buckskin
from
which
hung
a
hunting
knife
a
revolver
and
an
ammunition
pouch
but
diane
s
fascinated
gaze
lingered
longest
upon
the
indian
girl
s
face
of
the
sun
dark
caucasian
than
of
the
red
man
and
lovelier
than
either
with
grave
vigilant
eyes
of
dusk
a
straight
small
nose
and
firm
proud
mouth
vividly
scarlet
like
the
wild
flame
in
her
cheeks
aloof
impassive
the
indian
girl
stared
back
i
wish
well
to
the
beautiful
daughter
of
white
men
she
said
at
length
with
native
dignity
the
contralto
of
her
voice
was
full
and
rich
and
very
musical
her
english
deliberate
and
clear
cut
immensely
relieved
for
the
keen
glance
of
those
dark
indian
eyes
had
suddenly
softened
diane
leaped
impetuously
from
her
horse
across
the
fire
white
girl
and
indian
maid
clasped
hands
illustration
white
girl
and
indian
maid
then
clasped
hands
do
forgive
me
she
exclaimed
warmly
but
i
saw
your
fire
and
turned
this
way
before
i
really
knew
what
i
was
doing
just
as
diane
won
the
confidence
of
every
wild
thing
in
the
forest
so
now
with
her
winsome
grace
and
unaffected
warmth
she
won
the
forest
leaped
like
a
spark
from
eye
to
eye
then
with
a
slow
grave
smile
in
which
there
was
much
less
reserve
the
seminole
motioned
her
guest
to
a
seat
by
the
fire
nothing
loath
diane
promptly
tethered
her
horse
and
squatted
indian
fashion
by
the
cartwheel
fire
immensely
thrilled
and
diverted
by
her
picturesque
adventure
my
name
she
offered
presently
with
her
ready
smile
is
diane
di
ane
said
the
indian
girl
majestically
and
added
naively
she
was
the
roman
goddess
of
light
and
of
hunting
is
it
not
so
diane
looked
very
blank
where
in
the
world
she
stammered
staring
and
colored
the
indian
girl
smiled
from
so
high
she
said
shyly
i
have
been
taught
by
mic
co
like
the
white
wo
nt
believe
it
he
is
honorable
the
blind
woman
smiled
sadly
it
is
a
thing
with
which
honor
or
duty
or
law
has
nothing
to
do
and
i
fear
i
fear
it
is
already
too
late
because
i
kept
silent
when
i
should
have
opened
your
eyes
but
jonathan
was
not
listening
he
was
seeing
the
faces
of
his
friends
as
they
had
been
that
evening
the
scales
were
falling
from
his
eyes
an
evil
black
fear
entering
into
his
heart
oh
jonathan
my
son
my
dear
son
she
held
out
her
hands
to
him
and
he
went
to
her
and
knelt
at
her
side
man
and
he
bowed
his
head
on
her
knee
chapter
ix
a
new
house
radbourne
amp
company
was
in
a
daze
and
no
wonder
for
a
week
the
little
boss
had
not
once
beamed
the
spirited
hop
had
gone
out
of
his
walk
a
new
querulous
note
had
come
into
his
voice
when
a
matter
went
wrong
which
it
seemed
happened
oftener
than
usual
he
reminded
the
delinquent
of
the
fact
not
gently
but
sadly
as
though
deeply
aweary
of
the
frailty
of
men
miss
brown
confided
to
esther
that
she
was
well
on
the
way
to
nervous
prostration
esther
was
worried
and
wondered
what
grave
mischance
could
have
worked
out
such
a
change
in
jonathan
he
seemed
to
avoid
both
her
and
david
and
when
they
did
meet
his
manner
was
constrained
and
awkward
it
was
like
chicken
pox
and
evil
gossip
and
other
contagious
diseases
it
spread
gloom
hung
like
a
fog
over
office
and
shop
no
one
whistled
or
hummed
at
work
and
hegner
the
shop
foreman
who
had
been
sober
for
a
year
lost
his
grip
and
got
drunk
because
he
was
ashamed
and
hated
himself
his
temper
was
always
at
half
cock
and
smith
poor
smith
the
ex
convict
to
whom
jonathan
s
kindness
had
been
as
water
on
a
lame
duck
s
back
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
hegner
s
distemper
he
stood
it
as
long
as
he
could
which
was
not
very
long
one
noon
hour
he
presented
himself
sullen
and
whining
and
bleeding
at
the
nose
with
a
grievance
for
jonathan
s
ears
the
latter
looked
up
frowningly
from
the
pile
of
letters
he
was
signing
they
were
sadly
misspelled
the
agitated
miss
brown
having
been
at
her
worst
yes
smith
he
said
wearily
what
is
it
a
complaint
i
suppose
i
wants
to
know
began
smith
in
a
whine
why
i
ca
nt
git
a
square
deal
here
the
shop
boss
he
then
go
bring
him
here
and
say
what
you
have
to
say
before
him
smith
departed
to
return
a
few
minutes
later
an
apprehensive
eye
cast
back
at
the
trailing
hegner
now
smith
said
jonathan
what
is
your
complaint
the
boss
he
keeps
damnin
me
up
an
down
all
the
time
smith
explained
an
this
morning
he
slugs
me
right
here
on
the
beak
he
laid
a
gentle
finger
on
the
corpus
delicti
hegner
inquired
jonathan
why
do
you
keep
damning
him
up
and
down
all
the
time
and
why
did
you
slug
him
on
the
beak
because
hegner
grinned
sheepishly
his
beak
was
the
place
most
convenient
this
is
nt
a
joking
matter
jonathan
reminded
him
sharply
so
it
ai
nt
hegner
turned
a
glance
of
contempt
on
smith
he
s
a
bum
an
a
loafer
he
wo
nt
why
braun
who
d
ought
to
be
in
bed
instead
of
at
a
lathe
turns
out
half
as
much
again
as
him
how
can
i
jack
the
other
men
up
if
i
let
him
lag
behind
an
this
morning
i
told
him
i
d
had
enough
of
his
soldierin
an
what
i
thought
he
was
good
for
he
hauled
off
with
a
steelson
to
crack
me
but
i
beat
him
to
it
that
s
all
hegner
blew
tenderly
on
his
knuckles
smith
said
the
judge
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
tai
nt
so
he
s
only
huntin
an
excuse
to
fire
me
an
give
some
one
else
my
lathe
so
i
am
hegner
put
in
grimly
some
one
who
ll
work
an
who
ai
nt
an
ex
hegner
hold
your
tongue
jonathan
turned
to
smith
i
have
to
believe
hegner
because
i
ve
been
watching
you
i
told
you
at
the
time
not
to
do
you
a
favor
but
because
i
thought
you
were
in
earnest
and
would
justify
it
i
was
willing
to
be
your
friend
and
you
soldiered
you
stole
the
time
i
paid
you
for
which
is
the
same
as
stealing
my
money
and
you
stole
something
else
my
trust
which
is
worth
more
to
me
than
my
money
but
i
suppose
that
is
something
you
ca
nt
understand
i
un
erstan
s
when
i
ai
nt
wanted
answered
smith
with
an
ugly
laugh
i
ll
git
my
time
an
git
out
then
jonathan
s
trouble
found
voice
in
a
sharp
querulous
outburst
yes
get
your
time
i
m
tired
keeping
men
who
wo
nt
help
themselves
smith
vanished
and
his
surly
ugly
face
was
only
the
reflection
of
the
ugliness
just
then
in
his
heart
you
too
hegner
jonathan
turned
blazing
eyes
on
his
foreman
you
ve
been
you
ai
nt
more
disgusted
than
me
big
hegner
ashamed
looked
down
at
his
feet
but
i
could
nt
help
it
honest
i
could
nt
everything
s
been
goin
wrong
here
for
a
week
jonathan
s
outburst
ended
as
suddenly
as
it
began
i
know
he
said
wearily
i
know
an
hour
later
david
seeking
jonathan
on
a
matter
that
was
only
a
pretext
found
him
idle
elbows
on
the
desk
and
head
propped
in
his
hands
jonathan
looked
up
listlessly
the
matter
disposed
of
david
ventured
uncertainly
because
he
had
learned
the
last
week
to
remember
that
he
was
an
employee
as
well
as
a
friend
mr
radbourne
are
you
ill
no
i
m
afraid
something
s
wrong
something
s
wrong
david
i
hope
it
is
something
cowardice
of
the
american
soldiers
and
saw
them
wager
the
dewey
would
not
come
to
manila
at
all
but
that
he
would
sail
down
around
the
malay
peninsula
and
hasten
home
by
way
of
good
hope
to
save
his
vessels
from
certain
destruction
all
this
sounded
plausible
to
her
and
she
grew
restless
and
enthusiastic
as
the
dull
hours
dragged
away
dewey
was
so
long
in
coming
from
hongkong
and
the
garrison
on
the
island
had
been
kept
at
their
guns
ready
for
action
for
so
many
hours
without
rest
that
many
of
them
were
completely
tired
out
by
the
last
day
of
april
and
asked
for
relief
it
was
hard
to
give
it
marie
s
opportunity
had
come
her
ability
as
an
expert
rifle
shot
was
known
alike
to
officers
and
enlisted
men
she
offered
to
serve
the
spanish
commandant
could
not
well
refuse
he
needed
her
services
besides
power
to
win
the
temporary
friendship
of
the
natives
consequently
he
promised
to
assign
her
to
duty
for
the
night
the
sunset
as
viewed
from
corregidor
island
on
the
evening
of
april
was
most
glorious
not
a
cloud
was
in
the
sky
a
dead
calm
prevailed
so
that
the
sea
was
unusually
smooth
as
the
sun
sank
to
rest
behind
the
shimmering
horizon
it
caused
the
island
to
cast
a
long
shadow
over
manila
bay
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
but
this
soon
disappeared
when
the
sun
had
sunk
from
view
marie
noticed
that
a
comparatively
new
moon
was
visible
in
the
sky
and
she
remarked
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
it
will
not
be
very
dark
to
night
we
can
see
the
americanos
a
long
way
off
yes
replied
the
sergeant
the
only
difficulty
with
the
cowards
is
that
they
will
not
come
near
enough
to
be
seen
at
all
they
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
run
from
hongkong
to
manila
and
heard
of
i
ll
bet
you
a
peso
spanish
dollar
that
they
have
gone
home
and
that
all
of
this
excitement
has
been
for
nothing
dewey
is
getting
old
marie
he
does
nt
want
to
go
to
a
watery
grave
so
far
from
home
if
he
were
young
and
ambitious
it
would
be
different
old
men
do
not
care
much
about
real
fighting
especially
on
the
sea
it
is
different
with
old
generals
commanding
land
forces
they
can
sit
away
back
in
the
rear
of
the
battle
field
receive
messages
that
come
to
them
plan
certain
movements
based
upon
these
reports
and
while
they
do
have
considerable
responsibility
still
they
are
not
in
the
actual
fight
as
for
dewey
nobody
has
ever
heard
of
him
he
is
not
a
recognized
naval
commander
besides
the
old
fellow
according
to
reports
is
slow
and
easy
going
if
he
should
come
to
make
us
an
unfriendly
call
tonight
mark
my
word
marie
there
will
not
be
a
sliver
inside
of
thirty
minutes
after
the
first
shot
is
fired
he
had
scarcely
concluded
speaking
when
the
officer
of
the
guard
lieutenant
orlando
called
out
sergeant
of
the
guard
fall
in
the
first
relief
the
sergeant
threw
his
arm
over
marie
s
shoulder
in
an
affectionate
manner
smacked
a
hurried
caress
against
her
olive
cheek
jumped
up
from
the
little
bamboo
bench
on
which
they
were
sitting
rushed
up
to
the
guard
house
and
cried
out
first
relief
fall
in
marie
hastened
after
him
as
the
relief
was
forming
in
line
she
seized
a
mauser
rifle
that
stood
leaning
against
a
huge
rock
grabbed
up
a
cartridge
belt
well
filled
with
mauser
ammunition
that
was
lying
on
the
ground
near
by
hastily
adjusted
it
to
fit
her
waist
measure
buckled
it
on
and
fell
into
the
rear
rank
count
fours
ordered
the
sergeant
as
is
usual
in
military
affairs
the
front
and
rear
rank
men
count
in
unison
that
is
number
rear
rank
both
count
one
at
the
same
time
second
file
counts
two
etc
when
it
came
to
marie
she
piped
out
simultaneously
with
the
corporal
who
stood
in
front
of
her
quatro
four
as
the
guard
was
marched
along
the
stony
pathways
on
corregidor
island
and
the
various
sentinels
were
relieved
marie
soon
saw
that
there
was
not
going
to
be
a
place
for
her
she
tip
toed
up
to
the
corporal
who
was
posting
the
relief
and
asked
him
where
he
was
going
to
station
her
never
mind
said
the
corporal
we
have
a
place
for
you
and
sure
enough
they
had
every
soldier
or
civilian
who
has
ever
been
on
this
island
will
readily
recall
the
rough
hard
beaten
winding
path
that
led
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
in
a
south
westerly
direction
down
over
precipices
around
clumps
of
bamboo
to
a
beautiful
fresh
water
spring
which
bubbled
out
of
the
coral
rocks
at
a
point
just
high
enough
the
season
of
high
tides
a
few
feet
from
this
spring
and
elevated
but
slightly
above
it
is
a
massive
flat
rock
along
the
north
and
west
sides
of
this
rock
is
a
vertical
stone
precipice
some
eight
feet
high
which
from
its
upper
edge
inclines
back
gradually
at
an
angle
of
about

of
the
island
on

spain
firmly
bolted
one
of
her
most
modern
cannon
a
good
seven
inch
gun
it
was
so
situated
on
a
revolving
casement
that
its
shots
could
be
made
to
sweep
the
whole
boca
grande
channel
as
the
large
entrance
south
of
the
island
is
called
marie
had
often
operated
this
gun
she
had
done
splendid
work
with
it
on
a
floating
target
two
miles
distant
its
deadly
roar
was
her
delight
oh
if
she
could
but
use
it
just
once
on
an
actual
enemy
instead
of
firing
it
at
an
indicated
one
when
the
old
guard
had
been
relieved
and
the
sentries
were
marched
back
to
the
guard
house
marched
along
just
as
they
approached
the
guard
house
the
sergeant
motioned
to
her
to
fall
out
drove
hard
with
his
right
he
knew
that
he
gauged
the
distance
carefully
and
he
was
unable
to
account
for
the
fact
that
the
blow
failed
to
land
a
moment
later
he
staggered
back
a
trifle
from
a
blow
upon
the
side
of
the
cheek
davis
had
outgeneraled
him
there
there
was
not
much
force
to
the
blow
and
frank
smiled
now
davis
advanced
and
feinting
rapidly
with
both
hands
placed
his
right
against
frank
s
mouth
but
the
lad
had
perceived
the
blow
coming
and
stepped
quickly
backward
breaking
the
force
of
it
and
was
not
hurt
before
davis
could
cover
the
lad
placed
a
hard
right
and
left
to
davis
nose
up
this
advantage
quickly
and
followed
his
man
around
the
room
striking
out
whenever
opportunity
offered
plainly
davis
was
becoming
rattled
he
continued
to
retreat
now
frank
backed
him
into
a
corner
and
drove
a
hard
uppercut
to
the
chin
davis
head
jerked
backward
and
struck
the
hard
wood
of
the
wall
frank
stepped
back
and
allowed
davis
to
come
out
of
the
corner
davis
it
could
be
plainly
seen
was
furiously
angry
but
he
held
himself
in
check
apparently
realizing
that
victory
depended
upon
coolness
and
caution
frank
advanced
swiftly
swung
and
missed
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch
as
davis
jerked
his
head
sharply
to
one
side
before
the
lad
could
recover
davis
struck
out
viciously
and
landed
flush
on
frank
s
jaw
the
lad
staggered
back
but
before
davis
could
follow
up
his
advantage
frank
covered
and
held
his
opponent
off
the
blow
had
been
the
hardest
of
the
fight
so
far
davis
with
more
confidence
since
this
blow
stepped
forward
aggressively
feinted
right
to
frank
s
sore
jaw
again
frank
covered
up
and
gave
ground
believing
that
he
had
the
lad
at
his
mercy
davis
advanced
quickly
and
swung
hard
with
his
left
with
dazzling
rapidity
frank
stepped
inside
and
catching
the
swing
with
his
left
arm
planted
his
right
fist
squarely
upon
davis
nose
davis
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
and
leaped
back
frank
followed
pressing
him
closely
davis
seemed
content
to
remain
on
the
defensive
now
and
for
the
space
of
perhaps
a
minute
warded
off
all
the
lad
s
blows
with
a
really
remarkable
defense
even
jack
was
forced
to
give
him
his
due
he
can
box
he
muttered
but
i
doubt
if
he
can
keep
his
head
but
the
end
of
the
battle
came
now
with
sudden
and
unexpected
swiftness
frank
seeking
to
put
an
end
to
the
fight
stepped
forward
feinted
with
his
left
and
drove
his
right
straight
for
davis
chin
swinging
from
the
floor
davis
jerked
before
he
could
recover
davis
had
swung
hard
with
both
hands
and
both
blows
went
home
one
catching
frank
in
the
abdomen
doubling
him
up
and
the
other
straightening
him
again
as
it
landed
squarely
on
his
chin
frank
dropped
to
the
floor
and
lay
still
chapter
xviii
mistaken
for
an
enemy
davis
had
won
fairly
and
cleanly
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
but
jack
and
lord
hastings
wasted
no
time
in
considering
the
merits
of
the
encounter
each
sprang
forward
and
bent
above
the
lad
lord
hastings
raised
the
boy
s
head
to
his
knee
water
he
said
to
jack
the
latter
hastened
to
get
it
and
after
a
few
drops
had
been
sprinkled
over
his
face
frank
opened
his
eyes
he
glanced
up
curiously
at
lord
hastings
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
what
s
happened
matter
is
returned
jack
quietly
that
you
have
just
been
convinced
that
you
are
not
such
a
terrible
fighter
as
you
have
been
demanded
frank
suddenly
realizing
just
what
had
happened
he
did
returned
jack
dryly
and
he
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
it
but
i
tell
you
i
had
him
cried
frank
one
more
blow
and
and
the
one
more
blow
did
nt
land
replied
his
chum
but
i
tried
yes
you
tried
all
right
i
saw
you
you
just
missed
him
and
then
he
landed
on
you
twice
and
hard
that
s
why
you
re
here
he
could
nt
do
it
again
said
frank
feebly
maybe
not
and
maybe
yes
said
jack
however
you
re
not
going
to
have
another
trial
you
ve
been
licked
and
licked
good
and
proper
and
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
see
if
you
can
get
up
now
i
ll
take
you
to
our
own
quarters
frank
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
leaning
on
jack
his
coat
and
stood
near
as
the
two
passed
out
there
was
a
sneering
smile
on
his
puffed
face
and
he
spoke
perhaps
you
fellows
will
pay
a
little
more
attention
to
me
when
i
say
something
after
this
he
muttered
jack
whirled
on
him
sharply
see
here
he
said
quietly
if
you
make
any
trouble
in
the
future
i
ll
take
you
in
hand
myself
you
ll
find
that
the
result
will
be
somewhat
different
so
sneered
davis
feeling
not
a
little
proud
of
himself
you
are
at
liberty
to
try
at
any
time
right
now
eh
he
made
as
if
to
discard
his
coat
flushed
with
victory
he
manifested
no
doubt
that
he
could
handle
jack
as
well
as
frank
in
spite
of
himself
jack
was
forced
to
smile
we
wo
nt
fight
now
he
said
quietly
you
re
not
in
condition
in
the
first
place
but
when
you
have
been
fixed
trifle
with
me
threats
eh
call
them
what
you
please
i
do
nt
want
to
have
to
spank
you
but
i
may
have
to
do
nt
bother
me
that
s
all
he
helped
frank
from
the
room
without
another
word
lord
hastings
about
to
leave
the
room
stopped
for
a
word
with
davis
just
a
word
of
advice
he
said
as
you
know
we
are
on
a
perilous
duty
any
more
trouble
and
i
ll
have
you
ironed
if
necessary
you
re
in
no
position
to
make
a
nuisance
of
yourself
davis
made
no
reply
he
recognized
lord
hastings
authority
to
lanky
unprepossessing
man
with
a
truculent
eye
rimmed
by
lashless
lids
and
with
a
drooping
mustache
which
almost
concealed
the
cruel
curve
of
his
lips
whom
he
knew
as
denver
ed
having
met
him
several
times
in
the
durango
country
and
a
medium
sized
stranger
whom
he
knew
as
garvey
the
latter
was
dark
complexioned
with
a
hook
nose
and
a
loose
lipped
mouth
calumet
did
not
appear
to
notice
them
he
poured
his
glass
full
and
lifted
it
preparatory
to
drinking
before
it
reached
his
men
garvey
had
left
them
and
was
standing
beside
him
have
that
on
me
said
garvey
silkily
to
calumet
calumet
surveyed
him
with
a
glance
of
mild
interest
he
set
his
glass
down
and
the
other
silently
motioned
to
the
bartender
for
another
stranger
here
i
reckon
said
garvey
as
he
poured
his
whiskey
where
s
your
ranch
the
lazy
y
said
calumet
the
other
filled
his
glass
here
s
how
he
said
and
tilted
it
toward
his
lips
calumet
did
likewise
if
he
felt
the
man
s
hand
on
the
butt
of
the
six
shooter
at
his
hip
he
gave
no
indication
of
it
nor
did
he
seem
to
exhibit
any
surprise
or
concern
when
after
drinking
and
setting
the
glass
down
he
looked
around
to
see
that
garvey
had
drawn
the
weapon
out
and
was
examining
it
with
apparently
casual
interest
this
action
on
the
part
of
garvey
was
unethical
and
dangerous
and
there
were
men
calumet
or
to
one
another
whispered
the
significant
words
greenhorn
and
tenderfoot
others
to
whom
the
proprietor
had
spoken
concerning
calumet
looked
at
him
in
surprise
still
others
merely
stared
at
garvey
and
calumet
unable
to
account
for
the
latter
s
mild
submission
to
this
unallowed
liberty
the
proprietor
alone
remembering
a
certain
gleam
in
calumet
s
eyes
on
a
former
occasion
looked
at
him
now
and
saw
deep
in
his
eyes
a
slumbering
counterpart
to
it
and
discreetly
retired
to
the
far
end
of
the
bar
where
there
was
a
whiskey
barrel
in
front
of
him
but
calumet
seemed
unconcerned
some
gun
remarked
garvey
it
was
strange
though
that
he
was
not
looking
at
the
weapon
at
all
or
he
might
have
seen
the
empty
chambers
he
was
looking
at
calumet
and
it
was
apparent
that
his
interest
in
the
weapon
was
negative
yes
some
agreed
calumet
he
swung
around
and
faced
the
man
leaning
his
denver
ed
sauntered
over
and
joined
them
he
looked
once
at
calumet
and
then
his
gaze
went
to
garvey
as
he
spoke
friend
of
yourn
he
questioned
there
was
marked
deference
in
the
manner
of
garvey
he
politely
backed
away
shifting
his
position
so
that
denver
ed
faced
calumet
at
a
distance
of
several
feet
with
no
obstruction
between
them
calumet
s
eyes
met
denver
s
and
he
answered
the
latter
s
question
garvey
having
apparently
withdrawn
from
the
conversation
friend
of
his
sneered
calumet
grinning
shallowly
i
reckon
not
i
m
pickin
my
company
denver
ed
did
not
answer
at
once
he
moved
a
little
toward
calumet
and
shoved
his
right
hip
forward
so
that
the
butt
of
his
six
shooter
was
invitingly
near
then
with
his
hands
folded
peacefully
over
his
chest
he
spoke
you
do
he
said
you
mangy
there
was
a
stir
among
the
onlookers
as
the
vile
epithet
was
his
fingers
closed
around
the
butt
of
the
weapon
at
denver
ed
s
hip
the
gun
came
out
with
a
jerk
and
lay
in
calumet
s
hand
calumet
began
to
pull
the
trigger
the
dull
metallic
impact
of
the
hammer
against
empty
chambers
was
the
only
result
denver
ed
grinned
malignantly
as
his
right
hand
stole
into
his
vest
there
was
a
flash
of
metal
as
he
drew
the
concealed
gun
but
before
its
muzzle
could
be
trained
on
calumet
the
latter
pressed
the
empty
weapon
in
his
own
hand
against
the
one
that
denver
ed
was
attempting
to
draw
blocking
its
egress
while
in
calumet
s
left
hand
the
six
shooter
which
he
had
concealed
under
his
own
vest
roared
spitefully
within
a
foot
of
denver
ed
s
chest
many
in
the
room
saw
the
expression
of
surprise
in
denver
ed
s
eye
as
he
pitched
forward
in
a
heap
at
calumet
s
feet
there
were
others
who
saw
garvey
raise
the
six
shooter
which
he
had
drawn
from
calumet
s
holster
all
heard
the
hammer
click
impotently
on
the
and
cover
garvey
saw
the
flame
spurt
and
watched
garvey
crumple
and
sink
there
was
a
dead
silence
taggart
had
not
moved
calumet
s
gaze
went
from
the
two
fallen
men
and
rested
on
his

he
ignored
taggart
and
looked
coolly
around
at
his
audience
not
a
man
of
which
had
moved
he
saw
the
sheriff
standing
near
the
door
and
it
was
to
him

i

most
everybody
saw
the
play
some
raw
several
men
had
moved
one
of
pistol
but
his
fingers
went
to
his
belt
and
with
the
quickness
of
light
itself
he
hurled
a
knife
straight
at
marteau
the
woman
his
aim
her
movement
was
purely
instinctive
according
to
his
own
words
she
had
even
more
to
fear
from
marteau
than
from
this
ruffian
the
young
officer
instantly
dropped
to
his
knees
and
as
he
did
so
presented
his
pistol
and
fired
the
knife
whistled
harmlessly
over
his
head
and
buried
itself
in
the
wood
paneling
of
the
door
the
bullet
sped
straight
to
its
mark
the
unfortunate
blackguard
collapsed
on
the
floor
at
the
feet
of
the
girl
who
screamed
and
shrank
back
shuddering
now
mademoiselle
said
the
young
man
advancing
into
the
room
i
have
the
happiness
to
inform
you
that
you
are
free
chapter
vii
a
rescue
and
a
siege
the
woman
stared
at
him
in
wild
amazement
that
she
was
free
temporarily
at
least
could
not
be
gainsaid
her
captors
had
not
seen
fit
to
bind
her
and
she
now
stood
absolutely
untouched
by
anyone
the
shooting
the
fighting
had
confused
her
she
had
only
seen
marteau
as
an
accomplice
and
friend
of
change
of
heart
she
did
not
know
whether
she
had
merely
exchanged
masters
or
what
had
happened
smiling
ironically
at
her
bewilderment
which
he
somehow
resented
in
his
heart
marteau
proceeded
to
further
explanation
you
are
free
mademoiselle
he
repeated
emphatically
bowing
before
her
but
i
thought
did
you
think
that
i
could
be
allied
with
such
cowardly
thieves
and
vagabonds
as
those
but
you
said
it
was
simply
a
ruse
could
you
imagine
that
one
of
my
family
that
i
should
fail
in
respect
and
devotion
to
one
of
yours
to
you
i
determined
to
free
you
the
instant
i
saw
you
and
will
you
not
complete
your
good
work
broke
out
the
man
tied
to
the
chair
in
harsh
and
foreign
but
sufficiently
comprehensible
french
by
straightway
releasing
me
young
sir
but
who
is
this
this
is
sir
gervaise
yeovil
answered
mademoiselle
laure
my
attorney
an
came
with
me
from
chatillon
to
get
certain
papers
and
why
all
this
bother
and
explanation
burst
out
sir
gervaise
tell
him
to
cut
these
lashes
and
release
me
from
this
cursed
bondage
he
added
in
english
that
is
quite
another
matter
sir
said
marteau
gravely
i
regret
that
you
are
an
enemy
and
that
i
can
not
but
we
are
not
enemies
monsieur
cried
one
of
the
officers
who
had
just
succeeded
in
working
a
gag
out
of
his
mouth
we

officers
of

guard
and
since
you
have
deserted
the
cause
of
the
corsican
you

thundered
marteau
his
pale
face
flaming
that
was
as
much
a
ruse
as
the
other
what
then
do
you
mean
by
wearing
a
russian
coat
over
your
uniform
and
he
is
a
spy
he
shall
be
hanged
said
the
other
also
freeing
himself
of
his
gag
gentlemen
ask
me
to
release
you
in
order
that
you
may
hang
me
i
wo

burst
out
the

on
the
contrary
i
ll
give
you
fifty
pounds
if
you

shook
his

knife
on
the
table
yonder
pray
do
you
the
young
woman
made
a
swift
step
in
that
direction
but
the
frenchman
was
too
quick
for
her
pardon
me
mademoiselle
i
beg
that
the
first
use
you
make
of
your
new
life
be
not
to
aid
my
enemies
your
enemies
marteau
the
enemies
of
france
then
not
my
uncle

france
said
the
girl
but
your
father
s
and
i
had
hoped
yours
no
no
in
any
event
these
gentlemen
must
remain
bound
for
the
time
being
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
from
me
but
as
for
these
hounds
he
stepped
over
to
the
two
cossacks
who
lay
mute
he
bent
over
them
with
such
a
look
of
rage
ruthless
determination
and
evil
purpose
in
his
face
as
startled
the
woman
into
action
monsieur
she
cried
stepping
over
to
him
and
striving
to
interpose
between
him
and
the
two
men
marteau
what
would
you
do
my
sister
dead
in
the
cottage
yonder
after
after
he
choked
out
he
stopped
his
fingers
twitching
my
old
father
if
i
served
them
right
i
would
pitch
them
into
yonder
fireplace
or
torture
them
the
dogs
the
cowards
my
friend
said
the
young
countess
gently
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
marteau
threw
up
his
hands
that
touch
recalled
him
to
his
senses
i
will
let
them
alone
for
the
present
he
said
meanwhile
he
seized
the
dead
man
and
dragged
the
body
out
of
sight
behind
the
tables
will
monsieur
from
the
dim
recesses
of
a
far
corner
and
who
are
you
asked
marteau
lifting
the
light
and
staring
a
frenchman
sir
they
knocked
me
on
the
head
and
left
me
for
dead
but
if
monsieur
would
assist
me
i
marteau
stepped
over
to
him
bent
down
and
lifted
him
up
he
was
a
stout
hardy
looking
peasant
boy
pale
cheeked
with
blood
clotted
around
his
forehead
from
a
blow
that
he
had
received
feverish
fire
sparkled
in
his
eyes
if
monsieur
wishes
help
to
put
these
brutes
out
of
the
way
command
me
he
said
passionately
we
will
do
nothing
with
them
at
present
answered
marteau
quick
laure
the
knife
whispered
the
englishman
the
frenchman
heard
him
however
and
wheeled
around
mademoiselle
he
cried
on
your
honor
i
charge
you
not
to
abuse
the
liberty
i
have
secured
for
you
and
that
i
allow
you
but
friends
you
would
even
now
be
he
paused
as
my
sister
he
added
with
terrific
intensity
your
pleasure
shall
be
mine
said
the
young
woman
if
i
could
have
a
drink
of
wine
said
the
young
peasant
sinking
down
into
a
chair
there
is
a
flask
which
they
did
not
get
in
the
pocket
of

i
the
invasion
his
name
was
jimsy
and
he
took
it
for
granted
that
you
liked
him
that
made
things
difficult
from
the
very
start
that
and
the
fact
that
he
arrived
in
the
village
two
days
before
christmas
strung
to
such
a
holiday
pitch
of
expectation
that
if
you
were
a
respectable
bewhiskered
first
citizen
like
jimsy
s
host
you
felt
the
cut
and
dried
dignity
of
a
season
which
unflinching
thrift
had
threatened
by
his
bubbling
air
of
faith
in
something
wonderful
to
happen
he
had
arrived
at
twilight
just
as
the
first
citizen
was
about
to
read
his
evening
paper
and
he
had
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
yelling
back
at
old
austin
white
whose
sleigh
had
conveyed
him
from
the
station
to
the
house
a
s
long
uncle
pregnant
with
the
friendliness
of
a
conversational
ride
he
had
scraped
away
his
snow
heels
with
a
somewhat
sustained
noise
born
perhaps
of
shyness
and
now
as
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
prim
old
fashioned
room
a
thin
eager
youngster
not
too
warmly
clad
for
the
bite
of
the
new
england
wind
abner
sawyer
felt
with
a
sense
of
shock
that
this
city
urchin
whom
judith
had
promised
to
christmas
detracted
in
some
ridiculous
manner
from
the
respectability
of
the
room
he
was
an
inharmonious
note
in
its
staid
preciseness
moreover
it
was
evident
from
the
frank
friendliness
of
his
dark
gray
eyes
that
he
was
first
citizen
aura
of
informality
and
give
and
accept
friendship
as
a
matter
of
course
illustration
what
what
is
your
name
asked
the
first
citizen
peering
over
his
spectacles
he
wished
that
judith
s
christmas
protege
was
not
so
thin
and
a
trifle
larger

jimsy
answered
the
boy
an

he

chum
he
goes

mister
middleton

and
jimsy
the
first
citizen
helplessly
cleared
his
throat
and
summoned
judith
she
came
in
a
spotless
apron
no
whiter
than
her
hair
she
was
spare
aunt
judith
sawyer
spare
and
patient
as
the
wife
of
a
provident
man
may
well
be
who
sees
no
need
for
servants
and
her
primness
was
of
a
gentler
vaguer
sort
than
that
of
abner
sawyer
jimsy
glanced
up
into
her
sweet
tired
face
and
his
eager
eyes
claimed
her
with
a
bewildering
smile
of
welcome
then
because
jimsy
s
experience
with
clean
aprons
and
trimly
parted
hair
was
negligible
almost
to
the
should
polish
the
toe
of
one
worn
shoe
with
the
sole
of
the
other
and
study

result
and

furtive
interest

she
she
s
awful
good
that
way
when
she
s
sober
there
was
wistful
eagerness
in
his
face
to
illustration
quite
unconscious
of
the
scandalized
flutter
in
this
quiet
room
whose
oval
portraits
of
ancestral
sawyers
might
well
have
tumbled
down
at
the
notion
of
any
one
being
anything
but
sober
the
boy
moved
closer
to
the
fire
as
if
the
ride
had
chilled
him
illustration
gee
he
said
with
a
long
quivering
breath
ai
nt
that
a
fire
now
ai
nt
it
and
because
his
keen
young
eyes
could
not
somehow
be
evaded
abner
sawyer
accepted
the
responsibility
of
the
reply
and
said
hastily
that
it
was
then
feeling
his
dignity
imperilled
in
the
presence
of
judith
though
why
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
explain
he
moved
forward
a
chair
for
the
christmas
guest
and
returned
to
his
paper
aunt
judith
went
back
to
a
region
of
tinkling
china
and
humming
kettle
the
room
became
quiet
enough
for
any
one
to
read
but
the
first
citizen
somehow
could
not
read
he
was
ridiculously
conscious
of
that
tense
little
figure
by
the
fire
with
the
disturbingly
noisy
who
was
absolutely
quiet
yet
his
very
presence
seemed
to
clamor
the
clamor
of
an
inherent
sociability
repressed
with
difficulty
jimsy
glanced
at
the
checkerboard
window
beyond
which
snowy
hills
lay
beneath
a
sunset
afterglow
gee

he
burst

the

citizen
jumped
much
as
one
may
jump
when
he
has
waited
in
nerve
racking
suspense
for
a
pistol

the
boy
had
done

a

fur
any

afternoon
when
the
brewster
party
were
sitting
about
iced
fruit
drinks
amid
the
dingy
and
soiled
elegance
of
the
kast
s
one
private
parlor
mr
sherwen
immaculate
self
creaseless
except
for
one
furrow
of
the
brow
how
you
are
going
to
get
out
of
here
i
really
do
nt
know
he
said
why
should
we
hurry
inquired
miss
brewster
i
do
nt
find
caracuna
so
uninteresting
never
since
i
came
here
has
it
been
so
charming
said
the
legation
representative
with
a
smiling
bow
but
much
as
your
party
adds
to
the
landscape
i
m
not
at
all
sure
that
this
city
is
the
most
healthful
spot
for
you
at
present
you
mean
the
plague
asked
mr
brewster
not
quite
so
loud
please
healthful
as
i
used
it
was
in
part
a
figure
of
speech
something
is
brewing
hereabout
not
a
revolution
cried
miss
polly
with
eyes
alight
oh
do
brew
a
revolution
for
me
i
should
so
adore
to
see
one
possibly
you
may
though
at
most
the
dutch
blockade
is
perhaps
only
a
beginning
however
it
s
sufficient
to
keep
you
bottled
up
though
if
we
could
get
word
to
them
i
dare
say
they
would
let
a
yacht
go
out
senator
richland
of
the
committee
on
foreign
relations
is
an
old
friend
of
my
family
said
carroll
in
his
measured
tones
a
cable
would
probably
never
get
through
this
government
would
nt
allow
it
there
are
other
possibilities
perhaps
mr
brewster
he
continued
with
a
side
glance
at
the
girl
we
might
talk
it
over
at
length
this
evening
quite
useless
mr
sherwen
smiled
the
magnate
polly
would
have
it
all
out
of
me
before
i
was
an
hour
older
she
may
as
well
get
it
direct
very
well
then
it
s
this
quarantine
business
if
dr
pruyn
comes
here
and
declares
bubonic
plague
but
how
will
he
as
the
blockade
goes
the
dutch
will
help
him
all
they
can
but
this
government
will
keep
him
out
if
possible
he
is
not
persona
grata
asked
brewster
not
with
any
of
the
countries
that
play
politics
with
pestilence
but
if
he
s
sent
here
he
ll
get
in
some
way
in
fact
stark
the
public
health
surgeon
at
puerto
del
norte
let
fall
a
hint
that
makes
me
think
he
s
on
his
way
now
probably
in
some
cockleshell
of
a
small
boat
manned
by
indian
smugglers
it
sounds
almost
too
adventurous
for
the
scholarly
pruyn
whom
i
recall
observed
mr
brewster
the
man
who
went
through
the
cholera
anarchy
on
the
lazar
island
off
camacho
with
one
case
of
medical
supplies
and
two
boxes
of
cartridges
may
have
been
scholarly
he
certainly
did
nt
exhibit
any
distaste
for
adventure
well
i
wish
he
d
arrive
and
get
something
settled
only
i
d
like
to
have
you
out
of
the
way
away
mr
sherwen
pleaded
miss
polly
with
mischief
in
her
eyes
i
d
make
the
cunningest
little
office
assistant
to
busy
old
dr
pruyn
and
he
s
a
friend
of
dad
s
and
we
surely
ought
to
wait
for
him
if
only
i
could
send
you
the
fact
is
americans
wo
nt
be
very
popular
if
matters
turn
out
as
i
expect
shall
we
be
confined
to
our
rooms
and
kept
incomunicado
while
dr
pruyn
chases
the
terrified
germ
through
the
streets
of
caracuna
queried
the
irrepressible
polly
you
ll
probably
have
to
move
to
the
legation
where
you
will
be
very
welcome
but
none
too
comfortable
the
place
has
been
practically
closed
and
sealed
for
two
months
i
m
sure
we
should
bother
you
dreadfully
said
the
girl
it
would
bother
me
more
dreadfully
if
you
got
into
any
trouble
just
this
morning
there
was
some
kind
of
an
affair
on
a
street
car
in
which
some
americans
design
a
very
dainty
and
ornamental
design
in
insouciance
as
her
father
said
americans
any
one
we
have
met
no
news
has
come
to
me
i
understand
one
of
the
diplomatic
corps
returning
from
the
president
s
matinee
spoke
to
an
american
woman
and
an
american
man
interfered
when
did
this
happen
asked
carroll
about
noon
inquiries
are
going
on
quietly
the
young
man
directed
a
troubled
and
accusing
look
from
his
fine
eyes
upon
miss
brewster
you
see
miss
polly
he
said
no
lady
should
go
about
unprotected
down
here
ordinarily
it
s
as
safe
as
any
city
said
sherwen
just
now
i
ca
nt
be
so
certain
i
hate
being
watched
over
like
a
child
pouted
miss
brewster
and
i
love
sight
seeing
alone
the
flowers
along
the
calvario
road
were
so
lovely
that
s
the
road
to
the
palace
remarked
carroll
looking
marvelous
she
continued
cheerfully
who
lives
in
that
salmon
pink
pagoda
just
this
side
of
the
curve
trouble
sat
dark
and
heavy
upon
the
handsome
features
of
mr
preston
fairfax
fitzhugh
carroll
but
he
was
too
experienced
to
put
a
direct
query
to
his
inamorata
what
suspicion
he
had
he
cherished
until
after
dinner
when
he
took
it
to
the
club
and
made
it
the
foundation
of
certain
inquiries
thus
it
happened
that
at
eleven
o
clock
that
evening
he
paused
before
a
bench
in
the
plaza
bowered
in
the
bloom
of
creepers
which
flowed
down
from
a
balcony
of
the
kast
and
occupied
by
the
comfortably
sprawled
out
form
of
mr
thomas
cluff
who
was
making
a
burnt
offering
to
morpheus
good
evening
said
mr
carroll
pleasantly
evenin
how
s
things
returned
the
other
right
as
can
be
thanks
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
brewster
family
i
want
to
express
our
appreciation
of
your
assistance
to
miss
brewster
this
morning
but
it
might
have
been
a
great
deal
mr
brewster
will
wish
to
thank
you
in
person
aw
forget
it
besought
mr
thomas
cluff
that
little
lady
is
all
right
i
d
just
as
soon
eat
an
ambassador
let
alone
a
gilt
framed
secretary
to
help
her
out
miss
brewster
said
the
other
somewhat
more
stiffly
is
a
wholly
admirable
young
as
children
play
fell
dull
upon
his
ears
the
unsolicited
complaints
of
wives
and
mothers
all
unsatisfied
with
life
while
crowned
with
every
blessing
earth
can
give
longing
for
god
knows
what
to
bring
content
and
openly
or
with
appealing
look
asking
for
sympathy
the
first
blind
step
that
leads
from
wifely
honour
down
to
shame
is
ofttimes
hid
with
flowers
of
sympathy
he
saw
proud
women
who
would
flush
and
pale
with
sense
of
outraged
modesty
if
one
spoke
of
the
ancient
sin
before
them
bare
to
all
men
s
sight
or
flimsily
conceal
by
veils
that
bid
adventurous
eyes
proceed
charms
meant
alone
for
lover
and
for
child
he
saw
chaste
virgins
tempt
and
tantalise
lure
and
deny
invite
and
then
refuse
and
drive
men
forth
half
crazed
to
wantons
arms
mother
you
taught
me
there
were
but
two
kinds
of
women
in
the
world
the
good
and
bad
but
you
have
been
too
sheltered
in
the
safe
old
fashioned
sweetness
of
your
quiet
life
to
know
how
women
of
why
i
have
been
more
tempted
and
more
shocked
by
belles
and
beauties
in
the
social
whirl
by
trusted
wives
and
mothers
in
their
homes
than
by
the
women
of
the
underworld
who
sell
their
favours
do
you
think
me
mad
no
mother
i
am
sane
but
very
sad
i
miss
my
boyhood
s
faith
in
woman
s
worth
torn
from
my
heart
by
good
folks
of
the
earth
the
younger
born
the
modern
english
speaking
young
girl
is
the
astonishment
of
the
world
and
the
despair
of
the
older
generation
nothing
like
her
has
ever
been
seen
or
heard
before
alike
in
drawing
rooms
and
the
amusement
places
of
the
people
she
defies
conventions
in
dress
speech
and
conduct
she
is
bold
yet
not
immoral
she
is
immodest
yet
she
is
chaste
she
has
no
ideals
yet
she
is
kind
and
generous
she
is
an
anomaly
and
a
paradox
we
are
the
little
daughters
of
time
and
the
world
his
wife
we
are
not
we
are
marred
with
our
mother
s
follies
and
torn
with
our
father
s
strife
we
are
the
little
daughters
of
the
modern
world
and
time
her
spouse
she
has
brought
many
children
to
our
father
s
house
before
we
came
when
both
our
parents
were
content
with
simple
pleasures
and
with
quiet
homely
ways
modest
and
mild
were
the
fair
daughters
born
to
them
in
those
fair
days
modest
and
mild
but
father
time
grew
restless
and
longed
for
a
swifter
pace
and
our
mother
pushed
out
beside
him
at
the
cost
of
her
tender
grace
and
life
was
no
more
living
but
just
a
headlong
race
and
we
are
wild
yea
wild
are
we
the
younger
born
of
the
world
into
life
s
vortex
hurled
with
the
milk
of
our
mother
s
breast
we
drank
her
own
unrest
and
we
learned
our
speech
from
time
who
scoffs
at
the
things
sublime
time
and
the
world
have
hurried
so
they
could
not
help
their
younger
born
to
grow
we
only
follow
behind
them
as
they
ran
there
was
but
one
goal
pleasure
for
woman
or
for
man
and
they
robbed
the
nights
of
slumber
to
lengthen
the
days
brief
span
we
are
the
demi
virgins
of
the
modern
day
all
evil
on
the
earth
is
known
to
us
in
thought
but
yet
we
do
it
not
we
bare
our
beauteous
bodies
to
the
gaze
of
men
we
lure
them
tempt
them
lead
them
on
and
then
lightly
we
turn
away
by
strong
compelling
passion
we
are
never
stirred
to
us
it
is
a
word
a
word
much
used
when
tragic
tales
are
told
we
are
the
younger
born
yet
we
are
very
old
in
understanding
and
our
knowledge
makes
us
bold
boldly
we
look
at
life
loving
its
stress
and
strife
and
hating
all
conventions
that
may
mean
restraint
yet
shunning
sin
s
black
taint
we
know
wine
s
taste
and
the
young
maiden
bloom
and
sweetness
of
our
lips
is
often
in
eclipse
under
the
brown
weed
s
large
capacity
for
joy
or
pain
but
an
insatiable
appetite
for
pleasure
we
have
no
use
for
leisure
and
never
learned
the
meaning
of
that
word
repose
life
as
it
goes
must
spell
excitement
for
us
be
the
cost
what
may
speeding
along
the
way
we
ofttimes
pause
to
do
some
generous
little
deed
and
fill
the
cup
of
need
for
we
are
kind
at
heart
though
with
less
heart
than
head
unmoral
not
immoral
when
the
worst
is
said
we
are
the
product
of
the
modern
day
we
are
the
little
daughters
of
time
and
the
world
his
wife
we
are
not
like
the
children
born
in
their
younger
life
we
are
marred
with
our
mother
s
follies
and
torn
with
our
father
s
strife
happiness
there
are
so
many
little
things
that
make
life
beautiful
i
can
recall
a
day
in
early
youth
when
i
was
longing
for
happiness
toward
the
western
hills
i
gazed
watching
for
its
approach
the
hills
lay
between
me
and
when
some
traveller
crossed
the
hill
always
a
fine
grey
dust
rose
cloudless
against
the
sky
the
traveller
i
could
not
distinguish
but
the
dust
cloud
i
could
see
and
the
dust
cloud
seemed
formed
of
hopes
and
possibilities
each
speck
an
embryo
event
at
sunset
when
the
skies
were
fair
the
dust
cloud
grew
radiant
and
shone
with
visions
the
happiness
for
which
i
waited
came
not
to
me
adown
that
western
slope
but
now
i
can
recall
the
cloud
of
golden
dust
the
sunset
and
the
highway
leading
over
the
hill
the
wonderful
hope
and
expectancy
of
my
heart
the
visions
of
youth
in
my
eyes
and
i
know
this
was
happiness
there
are
so
many
little
things
that
make
life
beautiful
i
can
recall
another
day
when
i
rebelled
at
life
s
monotony
everywhere
about
me
was
the
commonplace
and
nothing
seemed
to
happen
each
day
was
like
its
yesterday
and
to
morrow
a
cruel
idea
commented
the
trained
nurse
perhaps
but
i
believe
organized
charity
even
of
that
sort
is
usually
ineffective
and
weakens
the
race
that
accepts
it
i
believe
victims
of
such
disaster
are
healthier
and
surviving
as
fate
decrees
keep
off
the
grass
cried
the
youngster
i
brought
back
a
car
full
of
books
the
hint
was
taken
and
we
talked
of
books
until
the
coffee
came
out
as
usual
the
trained
nurse
sat
behind
the
pot
and
when
we
were
all
served
she
pushed
the
tray
back
folded
her
strong
capable
white
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
said
quietly
messieurs
et
mesdames
we
lit
our
cigarettes
and
she
began
it
was
the
first
year
after
i
left
home
and
took
up
nursing
i
had
a
room
at
that
time
in
one
of
the
friendly
society
refuges
on
the
lower
side
of
beacon
hill
it
was
under
the
auspices
of
an
episcopal
high
church
in
the
days
of
father
hall
and
was
rather
english
in
tone
indeed
its
matron
was
an
englishwoman
gentle
round
faced
lace
capped
and
very
sympathetic
i
was
very
fond
of
her
i
had
josephine
was
a
tiny
creature
all
grey
in
tone
with
mouse
colored
hair
she
was
a
foundling
she
had
not
the
least
notion
who
her
people
were
her
first
recollections
were
of
the
orphan
asylum
where
she
was
brought
up
in
her
early
teens
she
had
been
bound
out
to
a
dressmaker
who
had
been
kind
to
her
and
when
her
first
employer
died
josephine
who
had
saved
a
little
money
and
longed
for
independence
began
to
go
out
as
a
seamstress
among
the
women
she
had
grown
to
know
in
the
dressmaking
establishment
and
went
to
live
at
one
of
the
christian
association
homes
for
working
girls
every
one
knows
what
those
boarding
houses
are
two
or
three
hundred
girls
of
all
ages
from
sixteen
up
of
all
temperaments
all
girls
willing
to
submit
to
control
girls
with
their
gay
days
and
their
tragic
girls
of
ambition
and
girls
with
faith
in
the
future
as
well
as
girls
of
no
luck
and
girls
with
their
simple
youthful
romances
a
little
lady
dainty
in
her
ways
industrious
unrebellious
always
ready
to
help
the
other
girls
about
their
clothes
and
a
model
of
a
confidant
every
one
told
her
their
little
troubles
every
one
confided
their
little
romances
they
were
sure
of
a
good
listener
who
never
had
any
troubles
or
romances
of
her
own
to
confide
i
do
nt
know
how
old
josephine
was
at
that
time
she
might
have
been
twenty
five
looked
younger
but
was
perhaps
older
she
was
so
tiny
and
such
a
mouse
of
a
thing
that
she
seemed
a
child
but
for
her
energy
and
her
capacity
for
silence
it
was
i
fancy
three
years
after
i
first
knew
her
that
she
one
evening
confided
to
a
group
of
her
intimate
friends
as
they
sat
together
over
their
sewing
that
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
there
was
a
great
excitement
little
lonely
josephine
so
discreet
who
had
sympathized
with
the
romances
of
so
many
of
her
comrades
had
kissing
as
went
on
you
never
saw
unless
you
have
seen
a
crowd
of
such
girls
together
every
one
was
full
of
questions
and
there
were
almost
as
many
tears
shed
as
questions
asked
he
was
a
carpenter
josephine
told
them
she
had
known
him
ever
since
she
was
with
the
dressmaker
who
took
her
out
of
the
asylum
he
lived
in
utica
new
york
he
had
a
good
job
and
they
were
to
be
married
as
soon
as
she
could
get
ready
so
josephine
set
to
work
with
her
nimble
fingers
to
make
her
trousseau
during
the
years
she
had
worked
for
me
the
matron
at
the
friendly
society
and
many
of
its
patrons
had
come
to
know
and
love
dear
little
josephine
and
in
our
house
there
was
almost
as
much
excitement
over
the
news
as
there
was
at
the
association
at
the
south
end
all
the
girls
set
to
work
to
make
something
for
little
josephine
every
one
for
whom
she
had
worked
gave
her
something
one
lady
gave
sewed
a
bit
of
underwear
for
her
she
had
sheets
and
table
linen
and
all
sorts
of
dainty
things
which
her
girl
friends
loved
to
count
over
and
admire
in
the
evening
without
the
least
bit
of
envy
by
the
time
spring
came
josephine
had
to
buy
a
new
trunk
to
pack
her
things
away
in
then
she
told
us
all
that
she
was
going
to
utica
to
be
married
what
was
the
use
of
his
spending
his
money
to
come
east
for
her
and
pay
his
expenses
back
that
seemed
reasonable
and
the
day
was
fixed
for
her
departure
her
trunks
were
packed
she
took
a
night
train
so
that
we
could
all
go
to
the
station
to
see
her
off
and
i
am
sure
that
the
crowd
who
saw
us
kissing
her
good
bye
are
not
likely
to
forget
the
scene
then
the
girls
went
home
chattering
about
dear
little
josephine
in
due
time
came
a
letter
from
a
place
near
utica
where
she
was
she
said
on
her
little
and
he
sent
his
love
and
it
was
signed
with
her
new
name
and
she
would
send
us
her
address
as
soon
as
she
was
settled
time
went
by
some
months
then
she
did
send
an
address
but
she
did
not
write
often
and
when
she
did
she
said
little
but
that
she
was
happy
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
after
she
left
that
news
came
that
josephine
had
a
son
by
that
time
a
great
many
of
the
girls
she
had
known
were
gone
changes
come
fast
in
such
a
place
but
there
was
great
rejoicing
and
those
who
had
known
her
found
time
to
make
something
for
dear
little
josephine
s
baby
and
the
sending
of
the
things
kept
up
not
explain
to
you
just
how
deeply
i
am
interested
in
the
saving
of
human
life
that
comes
first
with
me
my
theories
as
you
call
them
come
second
i
can
not
undertake
the
promotion
of
these
theories
as
a
salaried
advocate
this
is
the
only
stupid
and
impractical
thing
that
my
grandfather
ever
did
i
believe
he
must
have
known
that
the
terms
of
the
will
could
not
be
carried
out
mr
dodge
is
to
me
after
declaring
that
he
would
not
do
so
after
adding
the
codicil
annulling
the
bequest
intended
for
me
he
broke
a
solemn
compact
now
he
has
made
the
situation
absolutely
impossible
i
shall
not
act
as
trustee
of
this
fund
and
i
shall
not
use
a
penny
of
the
fortune
as
i
see
fit
judge
hollenback
there
must
be
some
other
channel
into
which
all
this
money
can
be
diverted
without
there
is
no
provision
sir
as
i
said
before
said
judge
hollenback
testily
it
can
only
be
released
by
an
act
of
yours
that
is
clear
quite
clear
then
i
shall
find
a
way
said
braden
resolutely
i
shall
go
into
court
and
ask
to
have
the
will
set
aside
as
that
s
it
sir
that
s
it
came
an
eager
voice
from
an
unexpected
quarter
wade
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
visibly
excited
by
the
prospect
of
relief
i
yes
very
queerly
during
the
past
few
months
i
should
say
that
he
was
of
unsound
mind
then
as
every
eye
was
upon
him
he
subsided
as
suddenly
as
he
had
begun
shut
up
whispered
murray
murderously
bending
over
the
better
to
penetrate
his
ear
you
damn
fool
judge
hollenback
indulged
in
a
frosty
smile
mr
wade
is
evidently
bewildered
then
turning
to
braden
he
said
mr
dodge
s
advice
is
excellent
think
the
matter
over
for
a
few
days
and
then
come
to
see
me
i
am
placed
in
a
most
unhappy
position
said
braden
with
dignity
mrs
thorpe
appreciates
my
feelings
i
am
sure
she
was
led
to
believe
as
i
was
that
my
grandfather
had
left
me
out
of
his
will
such
a
thing
as
this
subterfuge
never
crossed
my
mind
nor
hers
i
wish
to
assure
her
in
the
presence
of
all
of
this
i
know
it
braden
interrupted
anne
i
know
that
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
for
that
reason
i
feel
that
you
should
accept
the
trust
that
is
anne
cried
out
braden
incredulously
you
can
not
mean
it
you
i
do
mean
it
she
said
firmly
it
is
your
greatest
justification
you
should
carry
out
his
wishes
he
does
not
leave
you
the
money
outright
you
may
do
as
you
please
with
it
to
be
sure
but
why
should
you
agree
with
simmy
that
it
may
be
converted
solely
to
your
own
private
uses
why
should
you
feel
that
he
intended
you
to
have
it
all
for
your
own
does
he
not
set
forth
explicitly
just
what
uses
it
is
to
be
put
to
by
you
during
your
lifetime
he
puts
you
on
your
honour
he
knew
what
he
was
about
when
he
overruled
judge
hollenback
s
objection
he
knew
that
this
trust
would
be
safe
that
you
would
not
spend
a
penny
of
it
on
yourself
he
was
staring
at
her
blankly
mrs
tresslyn
was
speaking
now
but
it
is
doubtful
if
he
heard
a
word
that
she
uttered
he
was
intent
only
upon
the
study
of
anne
s
warm
excited
face
mr
thorpe
assured
me
a
little
over
a
year
ago
began
anne
s
mother
a
hard
light
in
her
eyes
that
it
was
his
determination
to
leave
his
grandson
out
of
his
will
altogether
it
was
his
desire
or
at
least
so
he
said
to
remove
from
braden
s
path
every
obstacle
that
might
interfere
with
his
becoming
a
great
man
and
a
credit
to
his
name
by
that
of
course
he
meant
money
unearned
he
told
me
that
most
of
his
fortune
was
to
go
to
charitable
and
scientific
institutions
i
had
his
solemn
word
of
honour
that
his
grandson
was
to
be
in
no
sense
a
beneficiary
under
his
will
he
please
mother
broke
eyes
and
so
how
are
we
to
reconcile
this
present
foolishness
with
his
very
laudable
display
of
commonsense
of
a
year
ago
went
on
mrs
tresslyn
the
red
spot
darkening
in
her
cheek
he
played
fast
and
loose
with
all
of
us
i
agree
with
braden
thorpe
there
was
treachery
in
ahem
coughed
judge
hollenback
so
loudly
and
so
pointedly
that
the
angry
sentence
was
not
completed
mrs
tresslyn
was
furious
she
had
been
cheated
and
anne
had
been
cheated
the
old
wretch
had
played
a
trick
on
all
of
them
he
had
bought
anne
for
two
millions
and
now
nothing
absolutely
nothing
was
to
go
to
charity
braden
was
seven
times
a
millionaire
instead
of
a
poor
but
ambitious
seeker
after
fame
in
the
few
minutes
that
followed
judge
hollenback
s
cough
she
had
time
to
restore
her
equanimity
to
its
habitual
elevation
it
had
for
once
stooped
perilously
near
to
catastrophe
meanwhile
her
son
george
had
arrived
at
a
conclusion
a
half
uttered
groan
and
crossed
over
to
braden
s
side
strange
fierce
pains
were
shooting
through
all
the
joints
and
muscles
of
his
body

circumstances
that

all

to

that
so
long
as

rotten
in
you
to

the

grinning
at
his

attempt
at

the

responded
the
stranger
and
drawing
a
fountain
pen
from
his
pocket
he
approached
the
register
and
wrote
upon
the
blank
page

he
walked
away
with
short
mincing
steps
that
seemed
to
them
all
very
comical
three
heads
at
once
bent
over
the
register
on
which
the

no

once
when

joselyn
used
to
come
here
there
was
lots
of
money
passed
between
em
i
saw
it
myself
i
helped
pick
it
up
once
when
they
quarreled
an
upset

with
serious
eyes
all
she
inquired
everything

that
you
can
recollect
you
ll
stick
to
gran

nt
ye
that
s
what

got
to
find
that
out
when
i
was
here
before
i
knew
he
had
some
secret
interest
to
which
he
was
devoted
but
i
was
too
indifferent
to
find
out
what
it
was
now
i
want
to
know
if

m
going
to
save
him
from
the
penalties

ingua
obeyed
for
ned
joselyn
only
pausing
to
answer
an
occasional
question
from
her
mother
when
she
came
to
that
final
meeting
at
christmas
week
and
joselyn
s
mysterious
disappearance
nan
asked
do
you
think
he
killed
him
i
was
pretty

nan
scowling
i

put
you

this
red
headed
grandmother
of
course
she
looked
at
phyllis
with
a
wistful
hope
in
her
eyes
phyllis
thoughtfully
lifted
the
this
is
a
lovely
material
she
said
thoughtfully
is
it
the
color
you
do
nt
like
n
no
joy
answered
doubtfully
it
s
the
make
then
she
burst
out
passionately
i
want
to
look
frisky
she
declared
i
want
to
be
dressed
the
way
john
s
used
to
seeing
girls
i
i
want
to
look
just
as
pretty
and
like
folks
as
gail
maddox
she
checked
herself
flushing
and
biting
her
lip
she
had
nt
meant
to
say
that
but
phyllis
took
it
beautifully
no
reason
why
you
should
nt
look
just
exactly
like
folks
she
soothed
this
is
lovely
too
this
silver
tissue
goodness
what
a
lot
of
material
there
is
in
these
angel
sleeves
she
held
it
up
consideringly
wait
a
minute
joy
i
think
i
read
my
title
clear
she
ran
out
of
the
room
coming
back
in
a
moment
with
a
life
size
here
s
dora
the
dress
model
she
said
cheerfully
she
adjusts
in
proof
she
began
to
screw
dora
down
and
in
to
required
proportions
measuring
her
by
joy
who
watched
operations
with
fascinated
eyes
i
never
knew
you
could
sew
she
said
my
father
was
a
country
minister
mrs
harrington
explained
flinging
the
green
frock
inside
out
over
the
steely
shoulders
of
dora
the
dress
frame
i
cook
very
nicely
if
i
do
say
it
myself
and
till
i
was
seventeen
i
did
every
bit
of
my
own
sewing
and
were
you
married
at
seventeen
no
phyllis
answered
stopping
a
moment
from
her
pinnings
and
speaking
more
gravely
my
father
died
then
and
i
went
to
work
i
had
nt
time
to
sew
after
that
i
bought
ready
made
things
so
when
i
was
married
that
was
a
long
seven
years
afterwards
i
did
have
such
lovely
times
buying
organdies
and
that
was
the
summer
allan
was
getting
well
she
stared
off
at
the
wall
for
a
moment
as
she
knelt
up
against
the
green
satin
that
was
the
loveliest
summer
i
ever
had
excepting
every
one
since
she
laughed
a
little
then
prevented
herself
from
further
speech
by
putting
a
frieze
of
pins
in
her
mouth
and
beginning
to
do
something
with
the
dress
with
them
one
by
one
do
you
mind
cutting
into
this
she
asked
when
that
row
was
gone
the
more
the
better
said
joy
with
enthusiasm
it
will
make
a
stunning
frock
with
the
silver
net
draped
over
the
pale
green
satin
m
m
that
silver
iridescent
girdle
on
the
other
dress
the
violet
can
i
have
that
too
joy
ripped
and
handed
with
tremulously
eager
hands
while
phyllis
swiftly
cut
away
the
sleeves
of
the
green
dress
and
slashed
a
decolletage
and
draped
the
net
over
it
and
pinned
on
the
girdle
try
if
she
invited
lifting
the
frock
gingerly
off
dora
and
dropping
it
over
joy
then
she
wheeled
her
around
to
where
she
could
see
her
reflection
in
the
tall
pier
glass
between
the
windows
of
course
that
s
rough
she
told
her
but
what
do
you
think
of
it
generally
are
there
any
changes
you
want
oh
not
one
joy
replied
ecstatically
regarding
the
slim
little
green
and
silver
figure
in
the
glass
it
needs
to
be
shorter
meditated
phyllis
aloud
and
fell
to
pinning
it
up
to
the
proper
shortness
joy
continued
to
look
at
it
rapturously
it
had
been
a
straight
long
gown
and
all
phyllis
had
needed
to
do
was
to
drape
it
with
the
net
ripped
from
the
other
dress
and
shorten
and
cut
it
into
fashionableness
it
was
charming
springlike
and
becoming
and
best
of
all
strictly
up
to
date
do
nt
you
think
you
ll
feel
equal
to
being
the
feature
of
the
certainly
should
in
your
place
that
is
if
you
have
silver
slippers
i
have
and
i
think
i
do
said
joy
gravely
then
i
ll
hand
this
over
to
viola
to
put
the
finishing
stitches
in
look
out
the
window
do
you
see
anything
familiar
coming
up
the
path
joy
in
her
pinned
finery
looked
then
snatched
her
clothes
from
the
sofa
where
they
lay
in
state
and
ran
upstairs
john
was
coming
along
the
path
and
she
did
nt
want
him
to
know
about
her
frock
till
it
was
all
done
she
came
down
a
moment
later
brown
clad
and
demure
and
looking
so
young
and
harmless
that
any
man
would
have
been
sure
his
tilt
with
her
of
the
night
before
was
a
dream
she
greeted
him
shyly
with
her
lashes
down
is
nt
is
nt
it
a
little
early
for
you
to
be
away
from
your
patients
she
asked
my
morning
office
hours
are
make
some
calls
in
the
car
want
to
come
he
asked
thank
you
said
joy
that
is
if
you
do
nt
think
i
d
be
in
the
way
if
i
thought
you
would
be
i
would
nt
have
asked
you
said
dr
hewitt
matter
of
factly
so
run
along
and
pin
up
your
hair
child
i
do
nt
want
people
to
think
i
ve
been
robbing
the
cradle
herself
for
trying
to
tease
him
even
if
he
did
nt
seem
to
see
it
she
liked
him
so
much
apart
from
any
other
feeling
that
it
was
hard
to
be
anything
but
nice
and
grateful
to
him
except
when
she
thought
of
gail
maddox
it
just
takes
two
hairpins
she
informed
him
coming
over
to
him
and
holding
up
the
ends
of
her
braids
you
wind
it
round
and
pin
it
behind
he
took
the
hairpins
and
the
braids
and
quite
deftly
did
as
she
asked
him
to
yet
with
a
certain
note
of
affection
in
his
voice
that
made
joy
feel
very
comforted
as
she
flew
to
get
her
cap
her
heart
gave
a
queer
pleasant
sort
of
turn
over
his
voice
made
her
feel
so
belonging
she
sang
as
she
went
and
phyllis
and
john
smiled
across
at
each
you
think
that
your
creative
fire
will
blaze
if
instead
of
throwing
in
your
wet
raw
thoughts
you
feed
it
a
few
seasoned
bits
you
open
therefore
the
drawer
of
your
desk
where
you
keep
your
rejected
and
broken
fragments
for
your
past
has
not
been
prosperous
hopeful
against
experience
that
you
can
recast
one
of
these
to
your
present
mood
this
is
mournful
business
certain
paragraphs
that
came
from
you
hot
are
now
patched
and
shivery
their
finer
meaning
has
run
out
between
the
lines
of
the
page
you
had
best
put
on
your
hat
you
will
get
no
comfort
from
these
stale
papers
one
evening
lately
being
in
this
plight
i
spread
out
before
me
certain
odds
and
ends
i
had
dug
deeper
than
usual
in
the
drawer
and
had
brought
up
a
yellow
stratum
of
a
considerable
age
i
was
poring
upon
these
papers
and
was
wondering
whether
i
could
fit
them
to
a
newer
measure
when
i
heard
a
slight
noise
behind
me
i
glanced
around
and
saw
that
a
man
had
entered
the
room
and
was
now
seated
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
in
the
common
nature
of
things
this
should
have
been
startling
for
the
hour
was
late
twelve
o
clock
had
struck
across
the
way
and
i
had
thought
that
i
was
quite
alone
but
there
was
something
so
friendly
and
easy
in
his
attitude
he
was
a
young
man
little
more
than
a
lanky
boy
that
instead
of
being
frightened
i
swung
calmly
around
for
a
better
look
he
sat
resting
in
his
hand
as
though
in
thought
by
the
light
that
fell
on
him
from
the
fire
i
saw
that
he
wore
a
brown
checked
suit
and
that
he
was
clean
and
respectable
in
appearance
his
face
was
in
shadow
good
evening
i
said
you
startled
me
i
am
sorry
he
replied
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
going
by
and
i
saw
your
light
i
wished
to
make
your
acquaintance
but
i
saw
at
once
that
i
was
intruding
so
i
sat
here
you
were
quite
absorbed
would
you
mind
if
i
mended
the
fire
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
took
the
poker
and
dealt
the
logs
several
blows
it
did
nt
greatly
help
the
flame
but
he
poked
with
such
enjoyment
that
i
smiled
i
have
myself
rather
a
liking
for
stirring
a
fire
he
set
another
log
in
place
then
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
dried
orange
peel
i
love
it
crackles
and
spits
he
ranged
the
peel
upon
the
log
where
the
flame
would
get
it
and
then
settled
himself
in
the
big
chair
perhaps
you
smoke
i
asked
pushing
toward
him
a
box
of
cigarettes
he
smiled
i
thought
that
you
would
know
my
habits
i
do
nt
smoke
so
you
were
going
by
and
came
up
to
see
me
i
asked
yes
i
was
not
sure
that
i
would
know
you
you
are
a
little
older
than
i
thought
a
little
stouter
but
dear
me
how
you
have
lost
your
hair
but
you
have
quite
forgotten
me
my
dear
boy
i
said
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
where
have
i
seen
you
there
is
something
familiar
about
you
and
i
am
sure
that
i
have
seen
that
brown
suit
before
we
have
never
really
known
each
other
the
boy
replied
we
met
once
but
you
since
that
meeting
a
great
many
times
i
lay
this
afternoon
on
a
hilltop
and
wondered
what
you
would
be
like
but
i
hoped
that
sometimes
you
would
think
of
me
perhaps
you
have
forgotten
that
i
used
to
collect
railway
maps
and
time
tables
did
you
i
replied
so
did
i
when
i
was
a
little
younger
than
you
are
perhaps
if
i
might
see
your
face
i
would
know
you
it
s
nothing
for
show
he
replied
and
he
kept
it
still
in
shadow
would
you
mind
he
said
at
length
if
i
ate
an
apple
he
took
one
from
his
pocket
and
broke
it
in
his
hands
you
eat
half
he
said
i
accepted
the
part
he
offered
me
perhaps
you
would
like
a
knife
and
plate
i
said
i
can
find
them
in
the
pantry
not
for
me
he
replied
i
prefer
to
bite
i
myself
care
nothing
for
plates
i
said
we
ate
in
silence
presently
you
have
my
habit
i
said
of
eating
everything
skin
seeds
and
all
everything
but
the
stem
he
replied
by
this
time
the
orange
peel
was
hissing
and
exploding
you
are
an
odd
boy
i
said
i
used
to
put
orange
peel
away
to
dry
in
order
to
burn
it
we
seem
to
be
as
like
as
two
peas
i
wonder
he
said
if
that
is
so
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
faced
me
although
his
face
was
still
in
shadow
doubtless
we
are
far
different
in
many
things
do
you
swallow
grape
seeds
hardly
i
cried
i
spit
them
out
i
am
glad
of
that
he
paused
it
was
a
breezy
hilltop
where
i
lay
i
thought
of
you
dear
me
no
oh
i
m
so
sorry
i
had
hoped
you
might
be
i
had
counted
on
it
it
is
very
disappointing
i
was
thinking
about
that
as
i
lay
on
the
hill
but
are
nt
you
just
on
the
point
of
doing
something
that
will
make
you
famous
by
no
means
dear
me
i
am
so
sorry
do
you
happen
to
be
married
yes
and
would
you
mind
telling
me
her
name
i
obliged
him
i
do
nt
remember
to
have
heard
of
her
i
did
nt
think
of
that
name
once
as
i
lay
upon
the
hill
things
do
nt
turn
out
as
one
might
expect
now
i
would
have
thought
but
it
s
no
matter
for
a
moment
or
so
he
was
lost
in
thought
and
then
he
spoke
again
you
were
writing
when
i
came
into
the
room
nothing
important
the
his
arms
impatiently
that
s
what
honor
and
recognition
and
you
re
selfish
enough
to
spoil
it
all
i
ve
never
spoken
to
norma
berwynd
in
any
way
to
which
her
husband
or
you
could
object
therefore
i
resent
your
attitude
my
attitude
i
m
your
wife
he
took
a
turn
across
the
stage
followed
by
her
eyes
pausing
before
her
at
length
he
said
quietly
now
i
insist
upon
it
if
you
are
here
when
i
return
i
shall
dismiss
the
rehearsal
i
refuse
to
allow
our
domestic
relations
to
interfere
with
my
business
he
strode
out
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
then
paced
the
dark
foyer
striving
to
master
his
emotions
a
moment
later
he
saw
his
wife
leave
the
stage
and
assumed
that
she
had
obeyed
his
admonitions
and
gone
home
the
property
man
appeared
with
an
armful
of
draperies
and
mechanical
appliances
interrupting
his
whistling
long
enough
to
call
out
here
s
the
new
hangings
mr
phillips
and
the
oriental
rugs
i
ve
got
the
dagger
too
he
held
a
gleaming
object
on
high
believe
me
it
s
some
davy
crockett
there
s
a
newspaper
guy
out
back
and
he
wants
your
ideas
on
the
american
drama
i
told
him
they
were
great
will
you
see
him
not
now
tell
him
to
come
back
later
say
that
john
danton
is
some
character
because
well
because
it
does
nt
happen
in
real
life
and
i
ve
tried
to
make
this
play
real
more
than
anything
else
when
norma
berwynd
and
her
husband
arrived
phillips
had
completely
regained
his
composure
and
he
greeted
them
cordially
the
woman
seemed
awed
half
frightened
by
her
sudden
rise
to
fame
she
seemed
to
be
walking
in
a
dream
and
a
great
wonder
dwelt
in
her
eyes
as
for
francis
he
returned
the
author
s
greeting
curtly
making
it
plain
that
he
was
in
no
agreeable
temper
i
congratulate
you
phillips
he
said
you
and
norma
have
become
famous
overnight
the
open
resentment
in
his
tone
angered
the
playwright
and
caused
him
to
wonder
if
their
long
deferred
clash
was
destined
to
occur
this
morning
he
knew
himself
to
be
overwrought
and
he
imagined
francis
to
be
in
no
better
frame
of
mind
nevertheless
he
answered
pacifically
if
that
is
so
we
owe
it
to
your
art
what
i
failed
to
detect
in
reading
and
rehearsing
the
piece
and
what
you
neglected
to
tell
me
namely
that
this
is
a
woman
s
play
there
s
nothing
in
it
for
me
there
s
nothing
in
my
part
oh
come
now
the
part
is
tremendous
you
merely
have
nt
got
the
most
out
of
it
as
yet
francis
drew
himself
up
and
eyed
the
speaker
coldly
you
re
quoting
the
newspapers
pray
be
more
original
you
know
of
course
how
i
stand
with
these
penny
a
liners
they
never
have
liked
me
but
as
for
the
part
he
shrugged
i
ca
nt
get
any
more
out
of
it
than
there
is
in
it
doubtless
that
was
my
fault
at
rehearsals
i
ve
called
this
one
so
we
can
fix
up
the
weak
spot
in
the
third
act
well
we
re
on
time
where
are
the
others
francis
cast
an
inquiring
glance
about
i
ll
the
former
speaker
opened
his
mouth
for
a
cutting
rejoinder
but
changed
his
mind
and
stalked
away
into
the
shadowy
depths
of
the
wings
please
make
allowances
for
him
norma
begged
approaching
phillips
in
order
that
her
words
might
not
be
overheard
i
ve
never
seen
him
so
broken
up
over
anything
he
is
always
unstrung
after
an
opening
but
he
is
terrible
this
morning
there
was
trouble
timidity
and
another
indefinable
expression
in
the
woman
s
eyes
as
they
followed
the
vanishing
figure
of
her
husband
faint
lines
appeared
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
lines
which
had
no
place
in
the
face
of
a
happily
married
woman
she
was
trembling
moreover
as
if
she
had
but
recently
played
some
big
emotional
role
and
phillips
felt
the
old
aching
pity
for
her
tugging
at
his
heart
he
wondered
if
those
stories
about
francis
could
be
true
it
has
been
a
great
strain
on
all
of
us
he
told
her
this
he
indicated
the
pile
of
morning
papers
and
at
sight
of
them
her
eyes
suddenly
filled
with
that
same
wonder
and
gladness
he
had
noticed
when
she
first
arrived
oh
h
i
i
m
breathless
something
clutches
me
here
she
laid
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
it
s
so
new
i
ca
nt
express
it
yet
except
well
all
of
my
dreams
came
true
in
a
night
some
fairy
waved
her
wand
and
lo
poor
ugly
little
me
she
laughed
although
it
was
more
like
a
sob
i
had
no
idea
my
part
was
so
immense
had
you
i
had
i
wrote
it
that
way
my
dreams
also
came
true
but
why
a
faint
flush
stole
into
her
cheeks
there
are
so
many
women
who
could
have
played
the
part
better
than
i
you
had
courage
to
risk
your
piece
in
my
hands
mr
phillips
perhaps
i
knew
his
face
with
startled
curiosity
or
better
at
least
than
the
world
knew
you
tell
me
there
is
something
wrong
i
m
afraid
he
resents
your
oh
no
no
she
denied
hastily
letting
her
eyes
fall
but
not
before
he
had
seen
them
fill
again
with
that
same
expression
of
pain
and
bewilderment
he
s
not
himself
that
s
all
i
you
wo
nt
irritate
him
please
he
has
such
a
temper
francis
came
out
of
the
shadows
scowling
well
let
s
get
at
it
said
he
phillips
agreed
if
you
do
nt
mind
we
ll
start
with
your
entrance
i
wish
you
would
try
to
express
more
depth
of
feeling
more
tenderness
if
you
please
mr
francis
remember
john
danton
has
fought
this
love
of
his
for
many
years
undertaking
to
remain
loyal
to
his
wife
he
does
nt
dream
that
diane
returns
his
love
for
he
until
this
instant
now
however
they
are
his
young
chickens
of
course
that
left
very
few
for
them
and
that
the
wild
berry
crop
was
poor
everybody
agreed
with
the
stranger
and
everybody
nodded
his
head
as
if
to
say
that
s
quite
true
at
least
everybody
but
mr
crow
he
was
determined
that
he
would
not
agree
with
anything
the
stranger
said
and
so
he
shouted
nonsense
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
a
murmur
ran
through
the
meeting
and
there
were
cries
of
put
him
out
that
s
what
i
say
too
mr
crow
bellowed
and
then
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
when
someone
near
him
said
they
mean
you
xxii
the
test
well
he
found
that
some
people
wanted
to
put
him
out
of
the
meeting
just
because
he
had
said
one
word
had
he
not
always
talked
more
than
anybody
else
at
those
sunset
meetings
in
the
pine
woods
luckily
no
one
made
a
move
to
oust
him
and
he
managed
to
keep
silent
for
a
little
while
but
he
was
so
angry
that
he
did
not
hear
what
the
stranger
was
saying
at
last
however
mr
crow
began
to
pay
attention
again
do
you
want
to
know
why
times
are
hard
and
food
is
scarce
in
this
neighborhood
the
impudent
fellow
asked
everybody
except
old
mr
crow
answered
yes
and
after
the
echo
had
died
away
the
stranger
continued
it
s
because
you
need
a
new
leader
he
declared
i
understand
that
a
person
called
old
mr
crow
has
been
your
leader
for
a
good
many
years
and
my
advice
to
you
friends
is
this
get
rid
of
him
a
good
the
older
and
wiser
of
his
listeners
shook
their
heads
who
is
there
that
could
take
mr
crow
s
place
a
voice
called
at
that
question
the
stranger
coughed
slightly
and
said
of
course
i
would
nt
suggest
any
one
specially
being
a
newcomer
here
myself
and
if
the
position
were
offered
to
me
i
do
nt
know
that
i
could
accept
it
though
i
have
had
so
much
experience
the
young
fellows
on
the
limb
with
mr
crow
at
once
set
up
a
great
cawing
we
want
you
they
chanted
old
mr
crow
might
have
been
a
scarecrow
for
all
the
attention
they
paid
to
him
and
he
did
not
dare
open
his
mouth
many
others
took
up
the
cry
and
a
great
hub
bub
arose
a
beating
of
wings
and
flying
up
and
down
and
jostling
some
of
the
younger
ones
squawked
like
chickens
others
pretended
to
cry
like
children
but
most
of
the
company
cawed
in
their
loudest
tones
until
the
old
mr
crow
s
best
friends
spoke
up
and
said
it
s
plain
that
a
good
many
people
want
you
for
a
leader
stranger
then
i
d
be
very
happy
to
act
as
such
the
bold
fellow
replied
and
i
ll
begin
at
once
but
the
elderly
person
who
had
just
spoken
said
that
there
was
no
hurry
and
that
the
stranger
ought
first
to
be
put
to
a
test
we
want
to
make
sure
that
you
re
a
good
leader
he
explained
and
i
would
suggest
that
you
go
to
see
farmer
green
to
morrow
tell
him
that
we
object
to
his
putting
tar
on
his
corn
and
ask
him
not
to
do
it
again
next
spring
the
stranger
looked
somewhat
uneasy
as
he
listened
but
after
he
had
pondered
for
a
few
moments
he
said
briskly
i
ll
do
that
i
ll
go
to
farmer
green
to
morrow
he
wo
nt
be
busy
for
to
morrow
s
sunday
and
i
ll
we
ll
meet
again
on
monday
at
sunset
mr
crow
s
friend
announced
and
then
the
meeting
broke
up
in
the
wildest
disorder
as
for
old
mr
crow
he
crept
away
without
speaking
to
anyone
and
always
before
he
had
made
more
noise
than
any
ten
of
the
others
xxiii
the
white
flag
unhappy
mr
crow
could
scarcely
eat
a
mouthful
of
food
after
that
meeting
on
saturday
night
when
he
found
the
stranger
talking
to
the
gathering
he
was
worried
because
he
knew
that
if
the
stranger
succeeded
in
getting
farmer
green
to
promise
that
he
would
not
put
tar
on
his
corn
the
following
spring
everybody
would
choose
the
newcomer
to
be
the
leader
of
all
the
crows
in
pleasant
valley
and
that
was
an
honor
that
old
mr
crow
had
had
for
years
for
two
whole
days
he
sulked
at
home
he
would
nt
even
go
to
his
door
when
anybody
knocked
but
on
monday
evening
mr
crow
was
the
first
to
reach
the
meeting
place
in
the
pine
woods
leader
s
seat
and
there
he
intended
to
stay
as
long
as
he
could
at
last
his
neighbors
came
straggling
to
the
woods
and
when
the
stranger
arrived
he
seemed
annoyed
because
he
could
not
have
mr
crow
s
seat
and
he
said
in
an
undertone
to
mr
crow
i
advise
you
to
go
home
the
old
gentleman
glared
at
him
and
he
answered
in
a
loud
voice
i
advise
you
to
go
home
yourself
if
you
have
a
home
to
go
to
now
some
people
thought
that
mr
crow
s
answer
was
a
good
one
so
they
laughed
and
that
made
the
stranger
feel
quite
uncomfortable
but
there
were
others
who
spoke
up
and
said
that
mr
crow
s
remark
was
very
unkind
they
knew
that
the
stranger
had
a
beautiful
home
further
north
because
he
had
told
them
all
about
it
and
that
made
him
feel
better
once
more
then
old
mr
crow
called
the
meeting
to
order
and
immediately
the
stranger
announced
in
a
loud
voice
then
there
was
even
more
noise
than
is
usual
at
a
crow
caucus
it
was
a
long
time
before
old
mr
crow
could
quiet
the
meeting
but
he
succeeded
at
last
and
when
it
was
still
he
said
to
the
stranger
how
do
you
know
farmer
green
has
surrendered
it
was
so
quiet
that
you
could
have
heard
a
pine
needle
trunk
and
the
two
peered
at
the
group
around
the
fire
some
kind
of
an
indian
pow
wow
half
breeds
mostly
whispered
kent

minute
then

squatting
around

blaze

of
them
was
speaking
they

as
if
they
were
waiting
for
some
one

lydia
with
some
of
the
old
thrill
of
pirate
plays

john
levine
emerged
from
the
darkness
of
the
forest
into
the
fire
glow
how
he
grunted
slipping
into
an
empty
space
opposite
the
two
eavesdroppers
how
returned
the
indians

in
the
woods

for

one
of
the
younger
indians
said
some
young
fellows
been
going
through
the
woods
measuring
out
a
road
and
they
acted
like
they
was
just
out
for
a
vacation
when
any
one
was
around
a
year
ago
i
see
one
of
the
fellows
riding
out
with
marshall
levine
grunted
lydia
s
heart
was
pounding
so
hard
that
it
really
pained
her
she
stared
at
john
unbelievably
yet
it
was
the
same
familiar
sallow
face
with
the
gaunt
look
about
the
cheeks
only
the
eyes
were
strange
lydia
had
never
seen
them
so
hard
so
searching
before
kent
was
breathing
deep
and
he
did
not
loose
his
hold
on
her
arm
well
said
levine
is
that
all
you
folks
have
got
to
report
after
six
months
what
do
you
think
i
m
paying
you
for
an
old
mixed
blood
almost
as
dark
as
a
full
blood

his
pipe
from
his
mouth

the
shoes

year

marshall
the
hog
grunted
levine
anything
more
what
more
might
have
come
lydia
did
not
know
for
an
old
squaw
came
tottering
into
the
fire
glow
she
was
gray
headed
and
emaciated
oh
that
s
our
old
squaw
kent
remember
whispered
lydia
shut
up
murmured
kent
the
squaw
made
her
way
up
to
john
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
look
of
her
and
he
rose
what
you
do
now
white
man
she
snarled
steal
steal
more
eh
levine
looked
down
on
her
and
his
voice
was
pitying
why
you
poor
old
devil
you
look
half
starved
he
dug
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
silver
dollar
go
get
some
grub
he
said
the
old
woman
stared
from
the
dollar
to
levine
s
face
and
her
voice
rose
to
a
men
drunk
make
our
young
girls
have
babies
that
grow
like
these
snakes
she
pointed
a
trembling
scrawny
finger
at
the
scowling
mixed
bloods
white
man
dirty
fool
dirty
thief
and
she
spat
at
levine
at
the
same
time
striking
the
dollar
from
his
hand
it
rolled
out
onto
the
needles
and
lay
shining
in
the
firelight
john
stiffened
and
the
mixed
bloods
watched
him
curiously
but
the
squaw
suddenly
burst
into
the
feeble
yet
deep
drawn
sobs
of
the
old
and
tottering
over
to
the
silver
she
picked
it
up
hungry
she
sobbed
all
the
time
much
hungry
and
she
started
slowly
away
from
the
fire
in
the
direction
of
kent
and
lydia
s
hiding
place
quick
whispered
kent
and
noiselessly
the
two
ran
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
woods
through
which
however
a
silver
light
was
beginning
to
filter
there
s
the
moon
he
said
in
a
low
voice
now
i
can
find
the
lake
silence
toward
the
rising
moon
in
less
than
half
a
mile
they
found
the
lake
and
far
around
its
curving
shore
the
gleam
of
their
own
camp
fire
holy
mike
what
do
you
think
of
that
demanded
kent
as
they
headed
for
the
fire
is
nt
levine
a
wonder
oh
kent
gasped
lydia
what
shall
we
do
do
cried
kent
why
keep
our
mouths
shut
and
see
what
happens
lord
what
an
adventure
lyd
i
would
nt
have
missed
this
day
for
a
hundred
dollars
lydia
scarcely
heard
him

she
murmured
my
best
friend
oh
i
ca
nt
believe
it
shucks
why
that

life

what
rich
pickings

the
real
estate
business
kent
it
s
stealing
just
as
my
squaw
said
and
it
s
just
the
meanest
dirtiest
kind
of
stealing
have
got
to
have
that
land
and
if
a
lot
of
sentimental
grannies
wo
nt
let
us
get
it
openly
we
ve
got
to
get
it
quietly
they
were
nearing
the
camp
now
and
kent
stopped
and
in
the
moonlight
d
been
feeling
too
miserable
to
get
up
and
drive
them
that
very
night
it
happened
she
got
her
cattle
home
turned
them
into
the
corral
and
went
into
the
house
into
her
room
behind
the
kitchen
and
shut
the
door
there
without
calling
to
anybody
without
a
groan
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
bore
her
child
i
was
basement
stairs
out
of
breath
and
screeching
baby
come
baby
come
she
says
ambrosch
much
like
devil
brother
william
is
surely
a
patient
man
he
was
just
ready
to
sit
down
to
a
hot
supper
after
a
long
day
in
the
fields
without
a
word
he
rose
and
went
down
to
the
barn
and
hooked
up
his
team
he
got
us
over
there
as
quick
as
it
was
humanly
possible
i
went
right
in
and
began
to
do
for
antonia
but
she
laid
there
with
her
eyes
shut
and
took
no
account
of
me
the
old
woman
got
a
tubful
of
warm
water
to
wash
the
baby
i
overlooked
what
she
was
doing
and
i
said
out
loud
mrs
shimerda
do
nt
you
put
that
strong
yellow
soap
near
that
baby
you
ll
blister
its
little
skin
i
was
indignant
illustration
antonia
driving
her
cattle
home
mrs
steavens
antonia
said
from
the
bed
if
you
ll
see
some
fine
soap
that
was
the
first
word
she
spoke
after
i
d
dressed
the
baby
i
took
it
out
to
show
it
to
ambrosch
he
was
muttering
behind
the
stove
and
would
nt
look
at
it
you
d
better
put
it
out
in
the
rain
barrel
he
says
now
see
here
ambrosch
says
i
there
s
a
law
in
this
land
do
nt
forget
that
i
stand
here
a
witness
that
this
baby
has
come
into
the
world
sound
and
strong
and
i
intend
to
keep
an
eye
on
what
befalls
it
i
pride
myself
i
cowed
him
well
i
expect
you
re
not
much
interested
in
babies
but
antonia
s
got
on
fine
she
loved
it
from
the
first
as
dearly
as
if
she
d
had
a
ring
on
her
finger
and
was
never
ashamed
of
it
it
s
a
year
and
eight
months
old
now
and
no
baby
was
ever
better
she
could
marry
and
raise
a
family
but
i
do
nt
know
as
there
s
much
chance
now
i
slept
that
night
in
the
room
i
used
to
have
when
i
was
a
little
boy
with
the
summer
wind
blowing
in
at
the
windows
bringing
the
smell
of
the
ripe
fields
i
lay
awake
and
watched
the
moonlight
shining
over
the
barn
and
the
stacks
and
the
pond
and
the
windmill
making
its
old
dark
shadow
against
the
blue
sky
iv
the
next
afternoon
i
walked
over
to
the
shimerdas
yulka
showed
me
the
baby
and
told
me
that
antonia
was
shocking
wheat
on
the
southwest
quarter
i
went
down
across
the
fields
and
tony
saw
me
from
a
long
way
off
she
stood
still
by
her
shocks
leaning
on
her
pitchfork
watching
me
as
i
came
we
met
like
the
people
in
the
old
song
in
silence
if
not
in
tears
her
warm
hand
clasped
mine
i
thought
you
d
come
jim
i
heard
you
were
at
for
you
all
day
she
was
thinner
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
and
looked
as
mrs
steavens
said
worked
down
but
there
was
a
new
kind
of
strength
in
the
gravity
of
her
face
and
her
color
still
gave
her
that
look
of
deep
seated
health
and
ardor
still
why
it
flashed
across
me
that
though
so
much
had
happened
in
her
life
and
in
mine
she
was
barely
twenty
four
years
old
antonia
stuck
her
fork
in
the
ground
and
instinctively
we
walked
toward
that
unploughed
patch
at
the
crossing
of
the
roads
as
the
fittest
place
to
talk
to
each
other
we
sat
down
outside
the
sagging
wire
fence
that
shut
mr
shimerda
s
plot
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
tall
red
grass
had
never
been
cut
there
it
had
died
down
in
winter
and
come
up
again
in
the
spring
until
it
was
as
thick
and
shrubby
as
some
tropical
garden
grass
i
found
myself
telling
her
everything
why
i
had
decided
to
study
law
and
to
s
relatives
in
new
york
city
about
gaston
cleric
s
death
from
pneumonia
last
winter
and
the
difference
it
had
made
in
my
life
she
wanted
to
know
about
my
friends
and
my
way
of
living
and
my
dearest
hopes
of
course
it
means
you
are
going
away
from
us
for
good
she
said
with
a
sigh
but
that
do
nt
mean
i
ll
lose
you
look
at
my
papa
here
he
s
been
dead
all
these
years
and
yet
he
is
more
real
to
me
than
almost
anybody
else
he
never
goes
out
of
my
life
i
talk
to
him
and
consult
him
all
the
time
the
older
i
grow
the
better
i
know
him
and
the
more
i
understand
him
she
asked
me
whether
i
had
learned
to
like
big
cities
i
d
always
be
miserable
in
a
city
i
d
die
of
lonesomeness
i
like
to
be
where
i
know
every
stack
and
tree
and
where
all
the
ground
is
friendly
i
want
s
put
into
this
world
for
something
and
i
know
what
i
ve
got
to
do
i
m
going
to
see
that
my
little
girl
has
a
better
chance
than
ever
i
had
i
m
going
to
take
care
of
that
girl
jim
i
told
her
i
knew
she
would
do
you
know
antonia
since
i
ve
been
away
i
think
of
you
more
often
than
of
any
one
else
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
d
have
liked
to
have
you
for
a
sweetheart
or
a
wife
or
my
mother
or
my
sister
anything
that
a
woman
can
be
to
a
man
the
idea
of
you
is
a
part
of
my
mind
you
influence
my
likes
and
dislikes
started
for
the
duck
pond
back
at
the
meeting
place
once
more
freddie
firefly
rushed
up
to
jimmy
rabbit
in
great
excitement
do
you
know
what
you
did
he
cried
you
brought
me
the
wrong
picture
and
dusty
moth
has
gone
shrieking
off
into
the
darkness
he
was
so
disappointed
this
is
not
betsy
butterfly
s
picture
it
s
some
dreadful
looking
caterpillar
and
when
i
glanced
at
it
just
now
over
in
the
orchard
it
sent
a
chill
all
through
me
for
the
time
being
jimmy
rabbit
said
but
before
freddie
had
finished
speaking
he
had
begun
to
smile
and
then
he
unwrapped
the
picture
once
more
and
leaned
it
against
a
stone
where
the
moon
s
rays
fell
squarely
upon
it
you
re
mistaken
he
informed
freddie
then
this
is
a
picture
of
betsy
butterfly
i
painted
it
myself
and
i
ought
to
know
as
i
explained
last
night
i
made
it
earlier
in
the
summer
and
as
i
said
she
has
changed
somewhat
in
the
meantime
but
it
s
a
very
good
likeness
of
her
as
she
was
once
you
mean
gasped
freddie
firefly
you
mean
that
betsy
butterfly
was
once
an
ugly
caterpillar
why
certainly
said
jimmy
rabbit
and
so
was
dusty
moth
for
that
matter
yes
he
was
a
caterpillar
himself
once
and
a
much
uglier
one
than
betsy
if
only
he
knew
it
in
fact
said
jimmy
looking
at
the
picture
with
his
head
on
one
side
great
beauty
even
at
so
early
an
age
xxii
the
skipper
in
farmer
green
s
meadow
there
lived
a
very
nervous
person
called
the
skipper
he
was
a
distant
cousin
of
betsy
butterfly
s
and
since
the
two
were
almost
exactly
the
same
age
they
quite
naturally
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
together
the
skipper
was
of
a
dark
somber
brown
shade
and
it
always
seemed
to
the
gaily
colored
betsy
that
he
tried
to
make
up
for
his
dull
appearance
by
being
extremely
lively
in
his
movements
he
was
forever
skipping
suddenly
from
one
place
to
another
a
trick
which
had
caused
people
to
call
him
by
so
odd
a
name
much
as
she
liked
this
queer
cousin
betsy
often
found
his
uncertain
habit
somewhat
annoying
it
was
not
very
pleasant
when
talking
to
him
to
discover
that
he
had
unexpectedly
left
her
when
she
supposed
he
was
right
beside
her
or
behind
her
if
she
had
anything
important
to
tell
him
she
frequently
had
to
hurry
after
him
and
the
worst
never
knew
when
he
would
dart
away
again
as
the
summer
lengthened
it
seemed
to
betsy
butterfly
that
the
skipper
grew
more
flighty
than
ever
once
she
had
been
able
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
before
he
went
swooping
off
but
now
now
she
could
not
even
tell
him
that
it
was
a
nice
day
without
following
her
cousin
at
least
half
an
hour
in
order
to
finish
her
remark
you
re
becoming
terribly
fidgety
betsy
told
him
at
last
if
you
do
nt
look
out
you
ll
have
nervous
prostration
or
i
shall
if
you
do
nt
stop
jumping
about
like
a
jack
in
the
box
i
advise
you
she
said
to
see
a
doctor
before
you
get
any
worse
of
course
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
betsy
butterfly
could
say
all
that
to
her
cousin
without
going
to
a
good
deal
of
trouble
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
to
follow
him
about
the
fields
for
two
whole
days
and
travel
several
miles
before
she
succeeded
in
finishing
what
she
feel
fine
the
skipper
cried
i
do
nt
need
a
doctor
i
he
started
to
skip
away
from
the
wild
morning
glory
blossom
on
which
he
had
perched
himself
but
betsy
caught
him
just
in
time
and
held
him
now
you
listen
to
me
she
commanded
you
re
in
a
dangerous
condition
some
day
someone
will
come
to
you
with
an
important
message
and
if
you
go
sailing
off
the
way
you
do
how
s
he
ever
going
to
tell
the
whole
message
until
it
s
too
late
perhaps
if
it
was
good
news
it
would
nt
hurt
it
to
keep
it
a
while
the
skipper
asserted
cheerfully
and
he
gave
a
quick
spring
with
the
hope
of
escaping
from
betsy
s
grasp
but
she
held
him
firmly
by
the
coat
tails
suppose
i
wanted
to
warn
you
not
to
go
near
the
flower
garden
because
johnnie
green
was
waiting
there
for
you
with
his
net
to
capture
you
and
put
you
in
his
you
did
nt
sit
still
and
listen
to
me
that
s
so
said
the
skipper
i
had
nt
thought
of
that
i
d
see
a
doctor
at
once
but
i
do
nt
know
any
go
to
aunt
polly
woodchuck
under
the
hill
betsy
butterfly
advised
him
she
s
the
best
doctor
for
miles
around
so
they
went
together
to
call
on
aunt
polly
the
old
lady
looked
at
the
skipper
and
shook
her
head
i
ca
nt
help
him
she
said
betsy
asked
anxiously
is
his
trouble
catching
no
indeed
said
aunt
polly
he
ca
nt
stay
in
one
place
long
enough
to
give
it
to
anybody
well
after
that
betsy
saw
very
little
of
her
cousin
the
skipper
but
she
did
not
mind
that
especially
since
she
soon
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
very
agreeable
young
gentleman
who
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
he
wore
said
that
his
manners
were
delightful
he
never
went
skipping
off
while
betsy
butterfly
was
talking
to
him

honey
bunch
just
a
little
girl
honey
bunch
her
first
visit
to
the
city
honey
bunch
her
first
days
on
the
farm
a
saloon
and
had
a
highball
he
was
not
a
drinking
man
at
least
he
never
had
been
one
beyond
a
convivial
glass
or
two
with
his
fellows
but
he
felt
that
day
the
need
of
a
little
push
toward
optimism
in
the
back
part
of
the
room
three
men
were
playing
freeze
out
bud
went
over
and
stood
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
because
he
was
still
having
some
trouble
with
his
thoughts
he
was
lonely
without
quite
knowing
what
ailed
him
he
hungered
for
friends
to
hail
him
with
that
cordial
hello
bud
when
they
saw
him
coming
no
one
in
alpine
had
said
hello
bud
when
he
came
walking
in
that
day
the
postmaster
bad
given
him
one
measuring
glance
when
he
had
weighed
the
package
of
ore
but
he
had
not
spoken
except
to
name
the
amount
of
postage
required
the
bartender
had
made
some
remark
about
the
weather
and
had
smiled
with
a
surface
friendliness
that
did
not
deceive
bud
for
a
moment
he
knew
too
well
that
the
smile
was
not
for
him
but
for
his
patronage
he
watched
the
game
and
when
the
man
opposite
him
pushed
back
his
chair
and
looking
up
at
bud
asked
if
he
wanted
to
sit
in
bud
went
and
sat
down
buying
a
dollar
s
worth
of
chips
as
an
the
game
was
not
keen
he
played
for
the
feeling
it
gave
him
of
being
one
of
the
bunch
a
man
among
his
friends
or
if
not
friends
at
least
acquaintances
and
such
was
his
varying
luck
with
the
cards
he
played
for
an
hour
or
so
without
having
won
enough
to
irritate
his
companions
wherefore
he
rose
from
the
table
at
supper
time
calling
one
young
fellow
frank
quite
naturally
they
went
to
the
alpine
house
and
had
supper
together
and
after
that
they
sat
in
the
office
and
talked
about
automobiles
for
an
hour
which
gave
bud
a
comforting
sense
of
having
fallen
among
friends
later
they
strolled
over
to
a
picture
show
which
ran
films
two
years
behind
their
first
release
and
charged
fifteen
cents
for
the
privilege
of
watching
them
it
was
the
first
theater
bud
had
entered
since
he
left
san
jose
and
at
the
last
minute
he
hesitated
tempted
to
turn
back
he
hated
moving
pictures
they
always
had
love
scenes
somewhere
in
the
story
and
tickets
and
it
seemed
unfriendly
to
turn
back
now
he
went
inside
to
the
jangling
of
a
player
piano
in
dire
need
of
a
tuner
s
service
and
sat
down
near
the
back
of
the
hall
with
his
hat
upon
his
lifted
knees
which
could
have
used
more
space
between
the
seats
while
they
waited
for
the
program
they
talked
in
low
tones
a
mumble
of
commonplaces
bud
forgot
for
the
moment
his
distaste
for
such
places
and
let
himself
slip
easily
back
into
the
old
thought
channels
the
old
habits
of
relaxation
after
a
day
s
work
was
done
he
laughed
at
the
one
reel
comedy
that
had
for
its
climax
a
chase
of
housemaids
policemen
and
outraged
fruit
vendors
after
a
well
meaning
but
unfortunate
lover
he
saw
the
lover
pulled
ignominiously
out
of
a
duck
pond
and
soused
relentlessly
into
a
watering
trough
and
laughed
with
frank
and
called
it
some
picture
he
eyed
a
succession
of
current
events
long
since
gone
stale
out
where
the
world
moved
swifter
than
here
in
the
mountains
into
close
touch
with
life
all
the
dull
months
he
had
spent
with
cash
and
the
burros
dwarfed
into
a
pointless
irrelevant
incident
of
his
life
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
out
in
the
world
doing
bigger
things
than
hunting
gold
that
somehow
always
refused
at
the
last
minute
to
be
found
he
stirred
restlessly
he
was
free
there
was
nothing
to
hold
him
if
he
wanted
to
go
the
war
he
believed
he
would
go
over
and
take
a
hand
he
could
drive
an
ambulance
or
a
truck
current
events
however
came
abruptly
to
an
end
and
presently
bud
s
vagrant
half
formed
desire
for
achievement
merged
into
biting
recollections
here
was
a
love
drama
three
reels
of
it
at
first
bud
watched
it
with
only
a
vague
disquieting
sense
of
familiarity
then
abruptly
he
recalled
too
vividly
the
time
and
circumstance
of
his
first
sight
of
the
picture
it
was
in
san
jose
at
the
liberty
he
and
marie
had
been
married
two
days
and
were
living
in
that
so
marvelous
and
so
fleeting
he
had
whispered
that
the
girl
looked
like
her
and
she
had
leaned
heavily
against
his
shoulder
in
the
dusk
of
lowered
lights
their
hands
had
groped
and
found
each
other
and
clung
the
girl
did
look
like
marie
when
she
turned
her
head
with
that
little
tilt
of
the
chin
when
she
smiled
she
was
like
marie
bud
leaned
forward
staring
his
brows
drawn
together
breathing
the
short
quick
breaths
of
emotion
focussed
upon
one
object
excluding
all
else
once
when
frank
moved
his
body
a
little
in
the
next
seat
bud
s
hand
went
out
that
way
involuntarily
the
touch
of
frank
s
rough
coat
sleeve
recalled
him
brutally
so
that
he
drew
away
with
a
wincing
movement
as
though
he
bad
been
hurt
all
those
months
in
the
desert
all
those
months
of
the
slow
journeying
northward
all
the
fought
battles
with
memory
when
he
thought
that
he
had
won
all
gone
for
nothing
their
slow
anodyne
serving
but
to
sharpen
upon
his
knee
small
beads
of
moisture
oozed
out
upon
his
forehead
he
sat
stunned
before
the
amazing
revelation
of
how
little
time
and
distance
had
done
to
heal
his
hurt
he
wanted
marie
he
wanted
her
more
than
he
had
ever
wanted
her
in
the
old
days
with
a
tenderness
an
impulse
to
shield
her
from
her
own
weaknesses
her
own
mistakes
then
in
those
old
days
there
had
been
the
glamor
of
mystery
that
is
called
romance
that
was
gone
worn
i
do
just
the
same
said
mr
dusenberry
promptly
and
it
ai
nt
hard
to
recall
either
because
nobody
buys
it
but
miss
tunie
scroggs
tunie
is
the
all
firedest
female
i
ever
did
see
crazy
after
a
husband
tunie
is
he
chuckled
if
i
was
nt
married
already
i
dare
say
tunie
would
have
worried
me
into
matrimony
before
now
tunie
s
trouble
is
that
everybody
knows
her
too
well
men
all
keep
out
of
her
way
but
she
s
a
dandy
tunie
is
they
tell
me
that
when
hinterman
the
plumber
hired
a
new
man
up
to
derlingport
and
tunie
found
out
he
was
a
single
feller
she
went
to
work
and
had
new
plumbing
put
in
her
house
just
so
s
the
feller
would
have
to
come
within
her
reach
but
he
got
away
he
did
said
mr
gubb
nervously
he
stood
tunie
as
long
as
he
could
and
then
he
threw
up
his
job
and
went
back
to
derlingport
they
tell
me
she
do
nt
do
nothin
much
now
but
set
around
the
house
and
think
up
new
ways
to
git
acquainted
with
men
that
ai
nt
heard
enough
of
her
to
stay
shy
of
her
sorry
i
ai
nt
got
no
ink
mr
gubb
it
s
a
matter
of
no
consequential
importance
thank
you
said
mr
gubb
and
he
went
out
he
was
distinctly
troubled
he
recalled
now
that
miss
scroggs
had
smiled
in
a
winning
way
when
she
spoke
to
him
and
that
she
had
quite
warmly
pressed
his
hand
when
she
departed
with
a
timid
bachelor
s
extreme
fear
of
designing
women
mr
gubb
dreaded
another
meeting
with
miss
scroggs
only
his
faithfulness
to
his
correspondence
school
diploma
had
power
to
keep
him
at
work
on
the
anonymous
wiggle
case
and
he
walked
thoughtfully
toward
the
home
of
mrs
canterby
he
went
to
the
back
door
good
afternoon
said
mr
gubb
i
been
a
little
nervous
about
that
paper
i
hung
onto
your
walls
if
i
could
take
a
look
at
it
well
now
mr
gubb
that
s
real
kind
of
you
said
mrs
canterby
you
can
look
and
welcome
if
you
just
wait
until
i
excuse
myself
to
miss
scroggs
is
she
here
asked
mr
gubb
with
a
hasty
glance
toward
his
avenues
of
escape
she
just
run
in
to
borrow
a
book
to
read
said
mrs
canterby
and
she
s
having
some
trouble
finding
one
to
suit
her
taste
she
s
in
my
lib
ry
sort
of
glancing
through
some
books
does
does
she
glance
through
to
about
near
to
page
fourteen
asked
mr
gubb
nervously
now
that
you
call
it
to
mind
said
mrs
canterby
that
s
about
how
far
she
is
glancing
through
them
she
s
glanced
through
about
sixteen
and
take
myra
s
lover
or
the
hidden
secret
but
she
ai
nt
sure
she
come
over
to
borrow
weldon
shirmer
but
i
had
lent
that
to
a
friend
she
was
real
disappointed
i
did
nt
have
it
mr
gubb
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
he
too
would
have
liked
at
that
moment
to
have
seen
a
copy
of
weldon
shirmer
and
to
have
read
what
stood
at
the
top
of
page
fourteen
if
it
ai
nt
too
much
trouble
mrs
canterby
he
said
i
wish
you
would
sort
of
fetch
that
myra
book
out
here
without
miss
scroggs
s
knowing
you
done
so
i
got
a
special
reason
for
it
in
my
deteckative
capacity
and
i
wish
you
would
nt
mention
to
miss
scroggs
about
my
being
here
land
sakes
said
mrs
canterby
what
s
up
now
miss
scroggs
she
s
right
interested
in
you
too
she
made
inquiries
of
me
about
you
when
you
a
real
handsome
gentleman
mrs
canterby
laughed
coyly
and
went
out
and
mr
gubb
dropped
into
a
chair
and
wiped
his
face
again
nervously
his
eye
falling
on
the
kitchen
table
noted
a
sheet
of
writing
paper
it
was
the
same
style
of
paper
as
that
on
which
the
anonymous
wiggle
letters
had
been
written
he
bent
forward
and
glanced
at
it
in
blue
ink
evidently
made
of
indigo
dissolved
in
water
was
written
on
the
sheet
a
recipe
the
writing
although
undisguised
and
slanting
properly
was
beyond
doubt
the
same
as
that
of
the
wiggle
letters
when
mrs
canterby
returned
to
the
kitchen
with
myra
s
lover
hidden
in
the
folds
of
her
skirt
the
perplexed
mr
gubb
held
the
recipe
in
his
hand
by
any
chance
of
doubt
he
said
do
you
happen
to
be
aware
of
whom
wrote
this
petunia
wrote
it
said
mrs
canterby
promptly
and
whatever
are
you
being
so
mysterious
for
there
s
no
mystery
there
is
often
mystery
hidden
into
mince
meat
recipes
when
least
expected
said
mr
gubb
i
see
you
got
the
book
he
took
it
and
turned
to
page
fourteen
at
the
top
of
the
page
were
the
words
completing
a
sentence
without
turning
a
hair
of
his
head
then
followed
the
first
complete
sentence
it
ran
a
woman
like
you
said
lord
cyril
should
be
loved
cherished
and
obeyed
goodness
exclaimed
mr
gubb
and
handed
the
book
back
to
mrs
canterby
why
did
you
say
that
asked
mrs
canterby
i
was
just
judging
by
the
book
that
miss
scroggs
is
fond
of
love
and
affection
in
fiction
tales
he
said
fond
of
exclaimed
mrs
canterby
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
anything
about
a
neighbor
lady
but
if
petunia
scroggs
ai
nt
crazy
over
love
and
marriage
i
do
nt
know
what
she
i
recall
about
tim
wentworth
furnaces
put
in
and
repaired
and
how
hungry
petunia
used
to
look
after
him
when
he
went
by
in
his
wagon
but
she
could
nt
get
after
him
because
she
has
nt
a
furnace
in
her
house
but
the
minute
he
hung
up
the
sign
chimneys
cleaned
she
was
down
to
his
shop
and
had
him
up
to
the
place
and
i
know
it
for
a
fact
for
i
took
some
of
the
hand
torch
it
was
able
to
cover
much
more
ground
at
a
time
and
with
its
help
a
white
envelope
half
hidden
in
the
long
grass
could
not
escape
detection
jack
could
easily
understand
just
what
had
happened
to
big
bob
he
first
flashed
into
his
brain
after
supper
that
for
the
life
of
him
he
found
it
impossible
to
say
positively
one
thing
or
the
other
now
he
thought
he
could
remember
distinctly
pushing
the
important
letter
through
the
slot
or
drop
inside
the
post
office
and
immediately
afterwards
doubts
again
assailed
him
leaving
him
worse
off
after
each
experience
if
they
failed
to
find
the
letter
and
the
postmaster
and
his
assistant
had
no
recollection
of
having
noticed
it
in
cancelling
the
stamps
of
the
heap
that
went
out
with
the
afternoon
mail
then
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
poor
bob
was
doomed
to
wait
day
after
day
as
even
weeks
went
on
always
dreading
lest
each
morning
was
destined
to
usher
in
the
time
when
his
great
crime
must
come
to
light
and
his
punishment
begin
they
were
soon
on
the
spot
and
each
with
his
separate
light
started
to
carefully
examine
the
long
and
tangled
grass
now
partly
dead
that
lay
on
either
side
of
the
well
worn
path
across
the
lots
doubtless
for
when
jack
on
one
occasion
started
to
say
something
he
saw
the
other
whirl
around
as
though
thrilled
with
expectations
that
were
immediately
doomed
to
disappointment
nothing
rewarded
their
search
bob
might
further
satisfy
himself
and
believe
he
was
only
doing
his
duty
by
coming
out
again
at
peep
of
dawn
and
once
more
covering
the
ground
before
giving
it
up
as
hopeless
but
jack
felt
certain
nothing
would
be
found
if
that
letter
had
dropped
from
the
boy
s
pocket
then
some
one
must
have
long
since
picked
it
up
he
believed
he
would
hear
of
it
if
this
person
being
honest
delivered
the
letter
at
the
post
office
and
told
how
he
had
come
to
find
it
on
the
vacant
lot
well
it
s
no
use
looking
any
further
i
guess
jack
big
bob
now
remarked
in
a
decidedly
dejected
tone
after
they
had
gone
twice
over
the
entire
width
of
the
three
lots
and
without
any
success
attending
their
efforts
i
m
afraid
not
because
he
felt
just
as
sorry
as
could
be
for
the
poor
chap
i
suppose
you
ll
sleep
mighty
little
tonight
for
worrying
over
this
thing
try
your
level
best
to
follow
out
all
you
did
when
in
the
post
office
some
little
thing
may
recall
to
your
mind
that
you
certainly
did
drop
that
particular
letter
in
the
slot
i
will
jack
surely
i
will
bob
told
him
vigorously
but
i
m
afraid
it
wo
nt
do
much
good
you
see
i
ve
become
so
mixed
up
by
now
thinking
one
thing
and
then
another
that
no
matter
what
did
happen
i
could
nt
honestly
say
i
remembered
it
but
i
still
have
a
little
hope
you
ll
hear
good
news
from
mr
dickerson
or
that
in
the
morning
it
may
be
handed
in
at
our
house
for
my
dad
put
his
full
address
on
the
back
flap
i
remember
that
very
distinctly
yes
i
d
be
willing
to
stand
my
gruelling
and
not
whimper
looking
quite
down
hearted
jack
saw
really
he
felt
very
sorry
for
big
bob
jeffries
the
latter
was
well
liked
having
a
genial
disposition
like
nearly
all
big
boys
do
the
smaller
runts
being
the
scrappy
ones
as
a
rule
as
every
one
knows
who
has
observed
the
lads
in
their
play
hours
and
made
any
sort
of
a
study
of
their
characteristics
on
another
occasion
jack
well
remembered
he
had
come
very
nearly
losing
one
of
the
best
players
on
the
baseball
nine
when
the
pitcher
alec
donohue
appeared
exceedingly
gloomy
and
confessed
to
jack
that
as
his
father
was
unable
to
obtain
work
in
the
chester
mills
and
shops
and
had
been
offered
a
position
over
in
harmony
he
feared
that
he
would
thus
become
ineligible
to
pitch
for
chester
but
jack
as
so
often
happened
when
trouble
beset
him
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
he
went
and
saw
a
gentleman
who
could
give
mr
donohue
employment
and
enlisted
his
sympathy
it
had
all
ended
right
by
of
work
and
so
alec
pitched
the
great
game
whereby
harmony
s
famous
team
went
down
to
a
crushing
defeat
jack
could
not
but
take
note
of
the
similar
conditions
by
which
chester
was
to
be
threatened
with
the
loss
of
one
of
the
strongest
members
of
her
team
looks
as
though
history
liked
to
repeat
itself
jack
mused
as
he
walked
back
home
after
parting
company
with
big
bob
only
in
this
case
it
s
the
football
eleven
that
s
liable
to
be
weakened
if
bob
s
father
takes
him
out
and
we
never
could
scare
up
a
fullback
equal
to
him
if
we
raked
old
chester
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
so
i
certainly
hope
it
ll
all
come
out
right
yet
i
surely
do
chapter
iv
a
friend
in
need
it
lacked
only
five
minutes
or
so
of
the
school
hour
on
the
following
morning
when
jack
winters
hurrying
along
was
intercepted
by
a
disturbed
looking
boy
who
had
been
impatiently
awaiting
his
arrival
of
course
this
was
none
other
than
his
customary
associates
ever
since
arriving
and
had
never
once
taken
his
eyes
off
the
street
along
which
he
knew
jack
must
come
he
seized
hold
of
the
other
eagerly
jack
needed
no
second
look
to
convince
him
that
poor
bob
had
passed
a
wretched
night
his
eyes
were
red
and
there
was
an
expression
of
mute
misery
on
his
usually
merry
face
that
doubtless
had
induced
more
than
one
fellow
to
ask
if
he
felt
ill
no
doubt
bob
had
a
stereotyped
answer
to
this
sympathetic
question
which
was
to
the
effect
that
he
was
not
feeling
himself
oh
i
thought
of
the
usurper
well
for
pity
sakes
what
are
you
doing
here
she
demanded
he
opened
his
eyes
slowly
and
looked
at
her
she
fitted
in
so
well
with
of
the
sky
and
the
world
s
fresh
beauty
that
he
took
her
appearance
as
a
part
of
the
picture
and
was
silent
it
was
only
when
she
repeated
her
question
rather
sharply
that
he
sat
up
to
explain
why
i
found
this
spot
months
ago
it
is
the
stillest
most
heavenly
nook
in
green
valley
i
come
up
here
whenever
i
m
tired
of
thinking
well
i
found
this
place
years
and
years
ago
nanny
complained
what
s
the
matter
with
us
both
using
it
he
said
very
civilly
but
objected
nan
this
is
the
sort
of
a
place
that
you
want
all
to
yourself
yes
it
is
he
agreed
and
did
not
let
the
situation
worry
him
further
he
did
nt
offer
her
a
seat
or
give
her
a
chance
to
take
herself
off
gracefully
and
nanny
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
awkward
she
was
nt
used
to
being
ignored
in
this
strange
fashion
are
you
up
at
her
with
eyes
as
innocent
and
serene
as
a
child
s
i
m
twenty
three
nan
was
startled
into
confessing
why
are
nt
you
married
as
she
gasped
and
searched
about
for
an
answer
he
added
in
india
a
girl
is
a
grandmother
at
that
age
this
is
nt
india
smiled
nan
good
naturedly
for
she
saw
quite
suddenly
that
this
big
young
man
knew
very
little
about
women
especially
western
women
no
this
is
nt
india
he
repeated
her
words
slowly
little
wrinkles
of
pain
ruffling
his
face
for
his
inner
eye
was
blotting
out
the
green
valley
picture
and
painting
in
its
stead
the
india
of
his
memory
the
india
of
gorgeous
color
the
bazaars
the
narrow
streets
the
india
that
held
within
its
mystic
arms
two
plain
white
stones
standing
side
by
side
and
bearing
the
inscriptions
father
and
mother
nan
not
guessing
what
was
going
on
in
his
heart
took
advantage
of
his
silence
twenty
eight
why
are
nt
you
married
why
in
the
world
should
i
be
he
wanted
to
know
green
valley
men
are
usually
the
fathers
of
two
or
three
children
at
your
age
she
informed
him
calmly
oh
he
smiled
frankly
of
course
i
shall
marry
some
day
but
a
man
need
never
hurry
he
unlike
a
woman
can
always
marry
and
i
intend
to
have
children
many
children
because
one
child
is
always
so
lonely
i
know
because
i
was
an
only
child
this
astounding
piece
of
confidence
kept
nan
s
tongue
tied
and
for
a
few
seconds
all
manner
of
funny
emotions
fought
within
her
she
wanted
to
laugh
to
get
angry
at
the
lordly
superiority
of
the
idea
that
a
woman
must
hurry
to
the
altar
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
feel
embarrassed
but
the
innocent
sincerity
with
which
it
was
all
uttered
kept
her
from
blushing
and
her
eyes
from
snapping
she
told
herself
instead
this
boy
from
india
was
certainly
the
weirdest
and
she
wondered
what
a
woman
not
his
mother
could
do
with
him
after
a
while
she
tried
again
do
nt
you
feel
rather
guilty
loafing
here
in
the
sunshine
no
why
what
should
i
be
doing
these
beautiful
afternoons
you
ought
to
be
devoting
to
pastoral
calls
but
i
attended
to
all
the
day
s
work
this
morning
i
helped
uncle
roger
allan
build
a
fence
and
doctored
up
david
s
pet
horse
dolly
i
spaded
up
a
flower
plot
for
grandma
wentworth
and
visited
little
jimmy
trumbull
who
s
home
from
the
hospital
doc
philipps
says
he
wo
nt
be
up
for
some
time
yet
so
to
cheer
him
up
i
ve
promised
him
a
party
i
also
drove
to
the
station
with
mrs
bates
ancient
horse
and
brought
home
her
new
incubator
while
i
was
there
jocelyn
brownlee
came
down
to
get
a
box
she
said
she
had
there
some
teasing
cousin
sent
her
a
little
live
pig
she
did
nt
know
what
to
do
so
i
put
the
pig
beside
the
incubator
and
sat
jocelyn
beside
me
and
we
proceeded
on
our
way
that
horse
belonging
to
mrs
bates
is
certainly
a
solemn
stately
beast
but
jocelyn
s
little
pig
was
anything
but
stately
we
made
an
interesting
and
a
musical
spectacle
as
we
went
along
and
i
know
that
one
little
red
headed
boy
in
this
town
was
late
for
school
because
he
followed
us
halfway
home
we
passed
the
tomlins
place
and
hen
was
sitting
at
the
window
propped
up
with
pillows
it
was
his
first
day
up
and
we
made
him
laugh
so
hard
that
his
wife
was
a
little
worried
i
think
agnes
is
rather
good
to
hen
these
days
is
nt
she
nan
ventured
to
ask
for
the
whole
town
knew
how
agnes
had
gone
to
the
minister
with
her
domestic
troubles
and
how
in
some
mysterious
fashion
this
young
man
had
worked
a
miracle
for
both
agnes
and
hen
were
as
suddenly
and
happily
in
instead
of
being
a
middle
aged
and
childless
couple
but
that
was
all
the
town
did
know
about
the
matter
for
strange
to
say
agnes
who
had
talked
loud
enough
and
long
enough
before
about
her
unhappiness
now
was
still
with
never
a
word
to
say
about
what
made
her
so
contented
and
happy
green
valley
saw
her
look
at
hen
as
if
he
were
suddenly
precious
and
smooth
his
pillow
and
wait
on
him
and
green
valley
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
but
so
far
nobody
knew
but
agnes
hen
and
the
new
minister
and
he
did
nt
seem
inclined
to
speak
about
it
not
even
to
satisfy
nanny
ainslee
s
curiosity
once
more
nanny
was
embarrassed
and
a
little
angry
she
swung
up
her
sunshade
and
started
to
go
this
minister
man
with
his
ignorance
of
women
and
his
knowledge
of
hen
s
domestic
affairs
was
which
we
shall
not
need
to
blush
and
which
will
really
be
civilized
did
the
saxon
workmen
have
to
make
dresden
china
in
germany
yes
works
under
the
patronage
of
the
emperor
were
opened
at
berlin
and
here
porcelain
was
made
the
profits
of
which
went
to
the
royal
treasury
the
workmen
being
paid
very
little
indeed
much
of
the
ware
manufactured
the
monarch
kept
for
his
own
use
and
much
of
it
he
gave
away
whenever
he
wished
to
make
a
fine
present
to
his
friends
but
so
lavishly
did
the
saxon
potters
use
the
deposits
of
native
clay
that
later
the
supply
became
poorer
in
quality
and
as
a
consequence
the
body
of
the
later
dresden
was
not
so
perfect
as
that
made
at
meissen
for
this
reason
collectors
set
great
value
on
the
early
dresden
work
the
figures
modeled
by
the
sculptor
kaendler
did
the
works
at
berlin
continue
inquired
theo
who
had
become
absorbed
in
the
story
yes
replied
mr
croyden
you
see
even
before
the
capital
at
dresden
was
captured
by
the
germans
and
the
meissen
workmen
carried
off
attempts
had
been
made
in
prussia
to
manufacture
porcelain
from
ordinary
stone
several
private
business
concerns
as
well
as
various
individuals
had
put
their
money
into
the
enterprise
and
had
even
met
with
some
success
but
this
ware
was
manufactured
on
no
very
extended
scale
now
however
the
emperor
was
determined
that
his
venture
should
succeed
not
only
did
he
bring
to
berlin
the
workmen
and
the
clay
but
he
even
sent
forth
the
edict
that
no
jew
in
his
kingdom
should
marry
until
he
had
purchased
an
entire
supply
of
porcelain
from
the
royal
factories
as
most
of
the
jews
were
rich
this
law
assured
their
master
a
wide
sale
for
his
product
that
they
did
not
wish
to
spend
all
not
at
all
most
of
these
unlucky
jews
bought
their
expensive
porcelain
sets
only
to
sell
them
afterward
to
other
customers
and
thus
get
them
off
their
hands
in
this
way
much
of
the
early
berlin
dresden
ware
found
its
way
into
russia
where
rich
russian
jews
were
glad
to
buy
it
after
repeated
improvements
the
berlin
porcelain
came
in
time
to
be
as
fine
as
that
made
originally
at
meissen
and
not
only
were
the
meissen
works
reopened
under
german
patronage
but
the
state
also
established
another
factory
at
charlottenberg
now
do
not
forget
theo
that
all
this
early
meissen
or
dresden
porcelain
as
well
as
that
eventually
manufactured
at
berlin
was
made
from
hard
paste
or
a
combination
of
clays
resulting
in
what
we
call
true
porcelain
later
on
i
shall
tell
you
much
about
soft
paste
wares
and
about
bone
china
none
of
those
varieties
however
ranks
as
real
porcelain
remember
that
only
the
hard
paste
products
are
genuine
mr
croyden
paused
a
moment
this
period
in
history
you
may
perhaps
be
interested
to
know
that
it
was
a
workman
who
escaped
from
meissen
into
austria
who
started
in
vienna
the
art
of
making
porcelain
from
hard
paste
true
porcelain
remarked
theo
who
had
profited
by
his
lesson
just
so
son
work
in
porcelain
making
had
been
going
on
in
austria
since
about
but
it
had
been
done
in
a
small
way
by
private
individuals
who
had
only
small
capital
to
put
into
it
and
who
had
met
with
little
success
because
the
ware
they
had
turned
out
had
been
thick
and
muddy
in
appearance
in
the
empress
maria
theresa
purchased
these
works
and
from
that
time
on
they
began
to
prosper
you
see
the
monarchs
of
those
days
could
make
almost
any
industry
a
success
if
they
once
set
out
to
do
so
not
only
had
they
the
capital
to
back
their
undertaking
but
they
could
compel
their
subjects
to
patronize
the
venture
theo
laughed
i
see
therefore
busy
place
which
was
supplying
with
porcelain
not
only
austria
but
also
turkey
in
lamprecht
one
of
the
leading
animal
painters
of
the
monarchy
was
decorating
this
ware
with
wonderful
pictures
of
stags
hounds
horses
in
which
work
he
excelled
but
because
of
the
mohammedan
law
that
no
copies
of
living
creatures
could
be
used
for
designs
the
turks
refused
to
purchase
these
dishes
hence
vienna
eager
to
retain
the
oriental
trade
was
forced
to
change
its
artistic
trend
and
make
instead
porcelains
adorned
with
arabesques
and
geometrical
figures
at
the
present
time
concluded
mr
croyden
there
are
extensive
pottery
and
porcelain
factories
throughout
germany
and
austria
hungary
and
much
of
our
finest
ware
comes
from
these
countries
were
you
to
study
history
you
would
find
that
many
of
these
factories
sprang
up
from
small
beginnings
and
that
amid
the
turmoil
of
european
strife
they
had
a
stiff
fight
for
existence
i
think
i
never
considered
before
the
effect
of
war
upon
anything
but
persons
remarked
theo
human
life
is
bad
enough
answered
mr
croyden
but
see
too
how
it
retards
the
arts
and
industries
of
the
world
may
the
day
be
not
far
distant
when
nations
shall
find
a
more
christian
and
intelligent
method
of
settling
their
differences
and
when
wars
shall
cease
forevermore

ix
the
romance
of
french
china
making
the
next
day
when
mr
croyden
put
his
head
in
at
theo
s
door
to
say
good
morning
he
found
the
boy
sitting
up
in
bed
eating
his
breakfast
and
his
first
remark
was
how
long
did
it
take
france
to
find
out
how
to
make
porcelain
mr
croyden
the
manufacturer
laughed
i
declare
if
you
are
not
beginning
this
morning
just
where
you
left
off
last
night
he
exclaimed
what
kind
of
porcelain
do
you
mean
hard
or
soft
paste
oh
any
kind
you
have
not
forgotten
the
vast
difference
between
the
hard
and
soft
ware
have
you
i
should
be
discouraged
if
you
do
nt
believe
you
would
let
me
forget
even
if
i
wanted
to
he
replied
with
an
impish
chuckle
i
certainly
should
nt
smiled
mr
croyden
then
he
added
more
seriously
soft
paste
can
make
up
your
mind
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
the
rain
and
the
sun
the
fog
and
the
wind
why
come
along
but
it
do
nt
do

bit
o
good
to

mrs

declared
curtly

i
can
tell
nellie
made
charlotte
writhe
and
was
probably
accountable
for
the
extra
acidity
of
her

yes

returned

watched
solicitously
to

if

manifested
any
symptoms
of
going
out
for

constitutional
she
asked
herself
with
a
good
deal
of
severity
why
she
should
dread
to

of

for

all
the

she
continued
to
cast
furtive
glances
at

who
showed
every
sign
of
relapsing
into
a
rocking
chair
with

in

i

be
throwin
em
up
to
me
just
because
they
ve
got
money
i
m
goin
there
whenever
they
ask
me
and
this
afternoon
s
one
o
the
times
she
off
some
hampering
annoyance
how
her
companion
managed
to
hold
her
under
the
spell
of
domination
which
seemed
merely
a
heavy
weight
of
silent
disapproval
she
did
not
understand
it
always
meant
jealousy
miss
mehitable
knew
that
and
usually
her
peace
loving
sunny
nature
pacified
and
coaxed
the
offended
one
but
occasionally
she
stood
her
ground
she
knew
that
presently
the
barry
car
would
again
draw
up
before
her
gate
and
she
felt
she
must
forestall
charlotte
s
sneers
how
soon
you
goin
inquired
the
latter
mildly
at
three
o
clock
returned
miss
upton
bravely
let
me
fix
your
collar
said
charlotte
rising
your
apron
rumpled
it
all
up
why
ca
nt
i
remember
to
bully
her
oftener
thought
miss
mehitable
it
always
does
her
good
just
like
medicine
promptly
at
three
ben
barry
jumped
out
of
his
car
before
miss
upton
s
emporium
and
mrs
whipp
dodged
behind
the
window
curtain
and
watched
them
drive
away
i
ben
poor
thing
i
kind
o
hate
to
leave
her
on
a
sunday
said
miss
upton
sighing
the
better
the
day
the
better
the
deed
remarked
her
companion
you
ve
got
me
all
het
up
about
you
and
your
umbrella
what
s
my
part
to
keep
you
out
of
the
lock
up

you
sault
n
batter
when
are
you
going
to
tell
me
you
see
that
s
one
thing
that
s
the
matter
with
charlotte
said
miss
mehitable
she
does
hate
to
think
i
m
keepin
anything
from
her
and
she
felt
it
in
the
air
do
you
believe
she
ll
visit
you
in
prison
i
ll
address
the
jury
myself
i
maintain
that
one
punishment

least

a
holiday
say
mehit

a
big
surprise
for
you
too
you
know
i
told
you
i
warned
mother
to
have
no
you

to
write
poetry
ben
the
speaker
suddenly
grasped
the
driver
s
coat
sleeve
i
never
thought
of
it
till
this
minute
but
ben
barry
miss
upton
s
voice
expressed
acute
dismay
are
you
in
love
why
does
it
mean
so
much
to
you
little
one
responded
ben
sentimentally
you
would
nt
take
near
as
much
interest
not
near
as
much
if
you
ve
got
a
girl
on
your
mind
one
dozens
mehit
i
m
only
human
dear
if
it
s
dozens
it
s
all
right
returned
miss
upton
relieved
there
s
always
room
for
one
more
in
that
case
but
what
is
your
surprise
then
ben
i
did
nt
want
to
be
alone
to
write
poetry
i
wanted
to
gloat
undisturbed
my
dandy
mother
is
giving
me
something
i
ve
been
aching
to
have
miss
upton
s
face
brightened
yes
i
know
something
s
are
wonderin
what
it
is
it
looks
like
some
queer
kind
of
a
stable
what
in
the
world
can
you
want
ben
you
ve
got
the
cars
and
a
motor
cycle
and
a
saddle
horse
well
confidentially
do
nt
tell
mehit
but
i
wanted
a
zebra
horses
are
too
commonplace
but
they
ca
nt
be
tamed
zebras
ca
nt
returned
miss
upton
much
disturbed
i
ve
read
about
em
you
ll
be
killed
i
shall
i
must
have
a
zebra
and
a
striped
riding
suit
to
be
happy
while
you
re
wearing
the
stripes
in
jail
i
ll
come
and
ride
up
and
down
outside
your
barred
window
and
cheer
you
up
i
do
nt
believe
it
s
a
zebra
declared
miss
mehitable
but
if
it
is
i
shall
tell
your
mother
you
can
not
have
it
ben
barry
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
sympathize
with
your
umbrella
oh
how
the
tinted
pearly
pink
thing
was
enough
and
too
much
one
flight
down
so
the
party
was
practically
over
mr
algernon
leary
of
the
firm
of
leary
amp
slack
counsellors
and
attorneys
at
law
with
offices
at
number
thirty
two
broad
street
was
among
the
very
last
to
depart
never
had
mr
leary
spent
a
more
pleasant
evening
he
had
been
in
rare
form
a
variety
of
causes
contributing
to
this
happy
state
to
begin
with
he
had
danced
nearly
every
dance
with
the
lovely
miss
milly
hollister
for
whom
he
entertained
the
feelings
which
a
gentleman
of
ripened
judgment
and
one
who
was
rising
rapidly
in
his
profession
might
properly
entertain
for
an
entirely
charming
young
woman
of
reputed
means
and
undoubted
social
position
a
preposterous
ass
named
perkins
at
least
mr
leary
mentally
indexed
perkins
as
a
preposterous
ass
had
brought
miss
hollister
to
the
party
but
thereafter
in
the
scheme
of
things
perkins
did
not
count
he
was
a
cipher
you
could
back
him
up
against
a
wall
and
take
a
rubber
tipped
pencil
and
rub
him
right
out
hollister
that
figuratively
was
what
mr
leary
had
done
to
mr
perkins
now
on
the
other
hand
voris
might
have
amounted
to
something
as
a
potential
rival
but
voris
being
newly
appointed
as
a
police
magistrate
was
prevented
by
press
of
official
duties
from
coming
to
the
party
so
mr
leary
had
had
a
clear
field
as
the
saying
goes
and
had
made
the
most
of
it
as
the
other
saying
goes
moreover
mr
leary
had
been
the
recipient
of
unlimited
praise
upon
the
ingenuity
and
the
uniqueness
expressed
in
his
costume
he
had
not
represented
a
little
lord
fauntleroy
or
a
buster
brown
or
a
boy
scout
or
a
juvenile
cadet
or
a
midshipmite
or
an
oliver
twist
there
had
been
three
boy
scouts
present
and
four
buster
browns
and
of
sailor
suited
persons
there
had
been
no
end
really
but
mr
leary
had
chosen
to
appear
as
himself
at
the
age
of
three
and
as
the
complimentary
comment
proved
his
get
up
had
reflected
credit
not
alone
upon
its
wearer
but
upon
its
designer
one
of
the
women
s
magazines
out
of
the
goodness
of
her
heart
and
the
depths
of
her
professional
knowledge
miss
skiff
had
gone
to
mr
leary
s
aid
supervising
the
preparation
of
his
wardrobe
at
a
theatrical
costumer
s
shop
up
town
and
on
the
evening
before
coming
to
his
bachelor
apartments
accompanied
by
her
mother
personally
to
add
those
small
special
refinements
which
meant
so
much
as
he
now
realised
in
attaining
the
desired
result
oh
mr
leary
i
must
tell
you
again
how
very
fetching
you
do
look
your
costume
is
adorable
really
it
is
so
so
cute
and
everything
and
i
do
nt
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
you
to
help
in
the
games
and
everything
there
s
no
use
denying
it
mr
leary
you
were
the
life
of
the
party
absolutely
at
least
twice
during
the
night
mrs
carroway
had
told
mr
leary
this
and
now
as
he
bade
her
farewell
she
was
saying
it
once
more
in
practically
the
same
touched
him
on
the
arm
scuse
me
suh
apologised
blanche
but
the
hall
man
downstairs
he
send
up
word
jes
now
by
the
elevator
man
at
you
d
best
be
comin
right
on
down
now
suh
effen
you
expects
to
git
a
taxicab
he
say
to
tell
you
they
ai
nt
but
one
taxicab
left
an
the
driver
of
at
one
s
been
waitin
fur
hours
an
he
act
like
he
might
go
way
any
minute
now
at
s
whut
the
hall
man
send
word
suh
blanche
had
brought
his
overcoat
along
and
held
it
up
for
him
imparting
to
the
service
that
small
suggestion
of
a
ceremonial
rite
which
the
members
of
her
race
invariably
do
display
when
handling
a
garment
of
richness
of
texture
and
indubitable
cost
mr
leary
let
her
help
him
into
the
coat
and
slipped
largess
into
her
hand
and
as
he
stepped
aboard
the
waiting
elevator
for
the
downward
flight
mrs
carroway
s
voice
came
fluting
to
him
surely
were
the
life
of
the
party
ii
it
was
fine
to
have
been
the
life
of
the
party
it
was
not
quite
so
fine
to
discover
that
the
taxicab
to
which
he
must
entrust
himself
for
the
long
ride
up
to
west
eighty
fifth
street
was
a
most
shabby
appearing
vehicle
the
driver
of
which
moreover
as
mr
leary
could
divine
even
as
he
crossed
the
sidewalk
had
wiled
away
the
tedium
of
waiting
by
indulgence
in
draughts
of
something
more
potent
than
the
chill
air
of
latish
november
mr
leary
peered
doubtfully
into
the
illuminated
countenance
but
dulled
eyes
of
the
driver
and
caught
a
whiff
of
a
breath
alcoholically
fragrant
and
he
understood
that
the
warning
relayed
to
him
by
blanche
had
carried
a
subtle
double
meaning
still
there
was
no
other
taxicab
to
be
had
the
street
might
have
been
a
byway
in
old
pompeii
for
all
the
life
that
moved
within
it
washington
square
facing
him
was
as
empty
as
a
graveyard
generally
is
at
this
hour
and
the
semblance
of
a
snow
the
first
of
the
season
sifting
down
in
large
damp
flakes
twice
and
thrice
he
repeated
the
address
speaking
each
time
sharply
and
distinctly
before
the
meaning
seemed
to
filter
into
the
befogged
intellect
of
the
inebriate
on
the
third
rendition
the
latter
roused
from
where
he
was
slumped
down
i
garcia
steve
he
said
thickly
i
garcia
firs
time
only
y
hollowed
s
loud
i
couldn
und
stancher
so
saying
he
lurched
into
a
semiupright
posture
and
fumbled
for
the
wheel
silently
condemning
the
curse
of
intemperance
among
the
working
classes
of
a
great
city
mr
leary
boarded
the
cab
and
drew
the
skirts
of
his
overcoat
down
in
an
effort
to
cover
his
knees
with
a
harsh
grating
of
clutches
and
an
abrupt
jerk
the
taxi
started
north
wobbling
though
he
was
upon
his
s
some
more
pennies
be
careful
this
time
he
warned
him
and
from
his
sack
