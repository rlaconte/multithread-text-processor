seemed
to
be
echoed
by
a
hundred
voices
as
the
boy
dashed
along
ninth
street
and
down
market
street
and
from
behind
him
and
from
doors
and
windows
and
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
at
length
from
before
him
the
very
welkin
rung
with
the
cries
of
stop
thief
stop
thief
a
hundred
eyes
were
strained
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
culprit
but
rodney
dashed
on
the
crowd
never
thinking
that
he
was
the
hunted
fox
but
only
one
of
the
hounds
in
pursuit
eager
to
be
in
at
the
death
at
the
corner
of
fifth
and
market
streets
a
porter
was
standing
by
his
wheelbarrow
he
saw
the
chase
coming
down
and
truly
scented
the
victim
and
as
rodney
neared
the
corner
he
suddenly
pushed
avoid
it
he
stumbled
fell
across
it
and
was
captured
you
young
scoundrel
is
this
one
of
your
tricks
said
the
constable
as
he
came
up
i
ll
teach
you
one
of
mine
and
he
struck
him
a
blow
on
the
side
of
the
head
that
knocked
the
poor
boy
senseless
on
the
pavement
those
who
stood
by
cried
shame
shame
and
the
officer
glared
furiously
around
him
but
seeing
that
the
numbers
were
against
him
he
raised
the
boy
from
the
ground
rodney
soon
recovered
and
the
constable
grasping
him
firmly
by
the
wrist
of
his
coat
and
drawing
his
arm
tightly
under
his
own
led
him
followed
by
a
crowd
of
hooting
boys
up
fifth
and
through
arch
street
toward
the
old
jail
what
a
walk
was
that
to
poor
rodney
the
officer
stern
and
angry
held
him
with
so
firm
a
grip
as
to
convince
him
of
the
uselessness
of
a
second
from
the
race
and
the
blow
he
was
compelled
almost
to
run
to
keep
up
with
the
long
strides
of
the
constable
a
crowd
of
boys
pressed
around
to
get
a
glimpse
of
his
face
what
has
he
done
one
would
ask
of
another
broke
open
a
trunk
and
stole
money
would
be
the
reply
rodney
pulled
bill
seegor
s
old
hat
over
his
face
and
hung
his
head
in
bitter
anguish
of
soul
as
he
heard
himself
denounced
as
a
thief
at
every
step
and
as
he
heard
doors
dashed
open
and
windows
thrown
up
similar
questions
and
replies
smote
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
was
innocent
of
such
a
crime
his
soul
scorned
it
he
felt
that
he
was
incapable
of
theft
but
he
felt
that
he
had
been
too
guilty
too
disobedient
and
too
ungrateful
to
dare
to
hold
up
his
head
or
utter
a
word
in
his
own
defence
it
seemed
as
though
that
long
and
terrible
walk
relieved
when
he
reached
the
heavy
door
of
the
jail
amid
two
files
of
staring
boys
who
had
ran
before
him
and
arranged
themselves
by
the
gate
to
watch
him
as
he
entered
he
was
rudely
thrust
in
the
bolt
shot
back
upon
the
closed
door
and
he
was
delivered
over
to
the
keeping
of
the
jailer
with
the
assurance
of
the
policeman
that
he
was
a
sharp
miscreant
and
needed
to
be
watched
chapter
viii
rodney
in
jail
such
are
the
rewards
which
sin
gives
to
its
votaries
full
of
soft
words
and
tempting
promises
in
the
beginning
they
find
in
the
end
that
it
biteth
like
a
serpent
and
stingeth
like
an
adder
thoughts
like
these
passed
through
rodney
s
mind
as
the
jailer
led
him
to
a
room
in
which
were
confined
three
other
lads
all
older
than
himself
at
that
time
the
system
of
solitary
confinement
had
not
been
adopted
in
pennsylvania
and
prisoners
were
allowed
to
associate
together
from
associating
with
older
and
more
hardened
culprits
whose
conversation
might
still
more
corrupt
them
and
they
were
therefore
confined
together
apart
from
the
mass
of
the
criminals
at
first
rodney
suffered
the
most
intense
anguish
a
sense
of
shame
and
degradation
overwhelmed
him
he
staggered
to
a
corner
of
the
room
threw
himself
on
the
floor
and
for
a
long
time
sobbed
and
wept
as
though
his
very
heart
would
break
for
a
while
the
boys
seemed
to
respect
his
grief
and
left
him
in
silence
at
last
one
of
them
went
to
him
and
said
come
there
s
no
use
in
this
we
are
all
here
together
and
we
may
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
rodney
sat
up
and
looked
at
them
as
they
gathered
around
him
they
were
ragged
in
dress
and
pale
from
their
confinement
and
rodney
involuntarily
shrank
from
the
idea
of
associating
with
them
regarding
them
as
criminals
in
jail
but
he
soon
remembered
his
and
he
thought
he
would
take
their
advice
and
make
the
best
of
it
well
what
did
they
squeeze
you
into
this
jug
for
my
covey
asked
the
eldest
boy
rodney
told
them
his
story
and
protested
that
he
was
innocent
of
any
crime
the
boy
put
his
thumb
to
the
end
of
his
nose
and
twirled
his
fingers
saying
you
ca
nt
gammon
us
my
buck
come
out
with
it
for
we
never
peach
on
one
another
rodney
was
very
angry
at
this
mode
of
treating
his
story
but
in
spite
of
himself
he
gradually
became
familiar
with
the
companions
thus
forced
upon
him
and
in
a
day
or
two
began
to
engage
with
them
in
their
various
sports
to
while
away
the
weary
hours
sometimes
they
sat
and
told
stories
to
amuse
one
another
and
thus
rodney
heard
tales
of
wickedness
and
depredation
and
cunning
that
almost
led
him
to
doubt
whether
there
was
any
robbers
burglars
and
pirates
as
if
they
were
the
models
by
which
they
meant
to
mould
their
own
lives
and
instead
of
detesting
their
crimes
rodney
began
to
admire
the
skill
and
success
with
which
they
were
perpetrated
the
excitement
and
freedom
and
wild
frenzied
enjoyment
of
such
a
life
as
depicted
by
the
young
knaves
began
to
fascinate
and
charm
his
mind
something
seemed
to
whisper
in
rising
vanity
was
crushed
by
the
insinuation
that
i
had
an
absurd
smirk
or
a
ridiculous
stare
however
the
opinions
of
human
beings
of
mature
age
never
much
disturbed
me
the
world
was
large
enough
for
them
and
me
and
i
could
contentedly
see
them
turn
to
their
own
objects
of
interest
while
i
awaited
in
calm
security
the
unqualified
praise
of
those
whose
praise
alone
was
valuable
to
me
their
children
and
grand
children
i
first
opened
my
eyes
to
the
light
in
the
pantheon
bazaar
how
i
came
there
i
know
not
my
conscious
existence
dates
only
from
the
moment
in
which
a
silver
paper
covering
was
removed
from
my
face
and
the
world
burst
upon
my
view
a
feeling
of
importance
was
the
first
that
arose
in
my
mind
as
the
hand
that
held
me
turned
me
from
side
to
side
i
looked
about
dolls
were
before
me
dolls
behind
and
dolls
on
each
side
for
a
considerable
time
i
could
see
nothing
by
degrees
as
my
powers
of
vision
strengthened
my
horizon
extended
and
i
perceived
that
portions
of
space
were
allotted
to
many
other
objects
i
descried
at
various
distances
aids
to
amusements
in
endless
succession
balls
bats
battledores
boxes
bags
and
baskets
carts
cradles
and
cups
and
saucers
i
did
not
then
know
any
thing
of
the
alphabet
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
quite
mastered
it
even
now
but
if
i
were
learned
enough
i
am
sure
i
could
go
from
a
to
z
as
initial
letters
of
the
wonders
with
which
i
soon
made
acquaintance
not
that
i
at
once
became
aware
of
the
uses
or
even
the
names
of
all
i
saw
no
one
took
the
trouble
to
teach
me
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
my
own
intense
observation
that
i
gained
any
knowledge
at
all
i
did
not
at
first
even
know
that
i
was
a
doll
but
i
made
the
most
of
opportunities
and
human
beings
their
powers
of
motion
made
a
decided
difference
between
them
and
the
other
surrounding
objects
and
naturally
my
attention
was
early
turned
towards
the
actions
of
the
shopwoman
on
whose
stall
i
lived
she
covered
me
and
my
companions
with
a
large
cloth
every
night
and
restored
the
daylight
to
us
in
the
morning
we
were
all
perfectly
helpless
without
her
and
absolutely
under
her
control
at
her
will
the
largest
top
hummed
or
was
silent
the
whip
cracked
or
lay
harmlessly
by
the
side
of
the
horse
she
moved
us
from
place
to
place
and
exhibited
or
hid
us
at
her
pleasure
but
she
was
always
so
extremely
careful
of
our
health
and
looks
and
her
life
seemed
so
entirely
devoted
to
us
and
to
our
advantage
that
i
often
doubted
whether
she
was
our
property
or
we
hers
her
habits
varied
so
little
from
day
to
day
that
after
watching
her
for
a
reasonable
time
i
felt
myself
perfectly
acquainted
with
her
and
in
a
condition
to
make
lady
and
a
little
girl
stopped
at
our
stall
oh
what
a
splendid
doll
exclaimed
the
child
pointing
to
the
waxen
beauty
which
outshone
the
rest
of
our
tribe
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
the
word
doll
though
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
illustrious
individual
to
whom
it
was
applied
and
it
now
flashed
upon
my
mind
with
pride
and
pleasure
that
however
insignificant
in
comparison
i
too
was
a
doll
but
i
had
not
time
to
think
very
deeply
about
my
name
and
nature
just
then
as
i
wished
to
listen
to
the
conversation
of
the
two
human
beings
may
i
buy
her
said
the
little
girl
can
you
afford
it
asked
the
lady
in
return
remember
your
intentions
for
your
brother
perhaps
i
have
money
enough
for
both
answered
the
child
how
much
does
she
cost
seven
shillings
said
the
shopwoman
taking
the
doll
from
her
place
utmost
advantage
i
have
three
half
crowns
said
the
little
girl
but
if
you
spend
seven
shillings
on
the
doll
answered
the
lady
you
will
only
have
sixpence
left
for
the
paint
box
what
does
a
paint
box
cost
asked
the
child
we
have
them
of
all
prices
replied
the
shopkeeper
from
sixpence
to
seven
shillings
the
little
girl
examined
several
with
great
care
and
stood
some
time
in
deliberation
at
last
she
said
i
do
nt
think
willy
would
like
a
sixpenny
one
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
him
answered
the
lady
he
draws
well
enough
to
want
better
colors
if
you
gave
it
to
him
he
would
thank
you
and
try
to
seem
pleased
but
he
would
not
really
care
for
it
however
he
does
not
know
that
you
thought
of
making
him
a
birthday
present
so
you
are
at
liberty
to
spend
your
money
as
you
like
asked
the
little
girl
yes
that
is
exactly
what
he
wants
then
he
shall
have
it
exclaimed
the
good
natured
little
sister
poor
dear
willy
how
many
more
amusements
i
have
than
he
she
bought
the
best
paint
box
and
received
sixpence
in
change
is
there
any
thing
else
i
can
show
you
asked
the
shopkeeper
no
thank
you
she
replied
and
turning
to
the
elder
lady
she
said
may
we
go
home
at
once
mama
it
would
take
me
a
long
time
to
choose
what
i
shall
spend
my
sixpence
in
and
i
should
like
to
give
willy
his
paint
box
directly
by
all
means
answered
the
lady
we
will
lose
no
time
and
i
will
bring
you
again
to
spend
the
sixpence
whenever
you
please
without
one
backward
glance
towards
the
beautiful
doll
the
child
tripped
away
by
the
side
of
her
companion
looking
the
brightest
and
happiest
of
how
long
i
can
not
say
for
dolls
are
unable
to
measure
time
they
can
only
date
from
any
particularly
striking
epochs
for
instance
we
can
say
such
an
affair
happened
before
i
lost
my
leg
or
such
an
event
took
place
before
had
but
bound
us
together
my
father
felt
half
saddened
and
half
cheered
you
see
we
have
had
autumn
winds
in
here
mr
rodney
he
said
the
buds
that
are
left
are
better
than
the
leaves
which
have
fallen
sir
said
mr
rodney
with
one
look
of
quick
if
the
next
season
were
summer
instead
of
winter
but
i
think
some
of
my
buds
grow
pale
under
this
frost
work
leaving
mr
howard
to
explain
and
tell
what
he
chose
we
began
to
prepare
tea
and
that
mr
rodney
s
eyes
might
not
be
shocked
with
any
more
dismantled
rooms
that
night
the
meal
was
spread
on
that
smallest
and
most
inconvenient
of
little
tables
in
the
sitting
room
its
want
of
accommodation
eked
out
with
an
extra
chair
or
two
for
this
our
friend
had
no
grave
looks
and
we
laughed
off
the
inconvenience
and
enjoyed
the
tea
as
much
as
possible
then
when
we
had
again
drawn
round
the
fire
talking
went
on
briskly
for
a
time
and
the
flickering
light
made
our
faces
perhaps
seem
gayer
than
they
were
but
was
at
all
events
a
very
hopeful
cheer
up
sort
of
a
companion
after
that
came
a
long
unbroken
silence
papa
said
kate
softly
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
forehead
have
you
any
least
my
dear
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
could
nt
your
thoughts
come
back
for
a
little
while
said
my
stepmother
i
think
we
are
in
great
danger
of
what
you
call
moodiness
mr
rodney
said
my
father
with
a
suddenness
that
spoke
a
mind
far
away
from
these
last
remarks
i
have
been
dreaming
of
a
man
who
had
a
precious
jewel
that
he
wanted
to
give
to
a
friend
but
when
the
time
came
behold
there
was
no
golden
box
wherein
to
put
it
and
i
have
been
dreaming
too
sir
said
mr
collingwood
quickly
but
it
was
of
a
jewel
so
precious
that
its
golden
box
seemed
but
the
lead
that
held
fair
portia
s
counterfeit
ah
said
my
father
shaking
his
head
but
smiling
too
a
little
my
lord
bassanio
was
a
very
sensible
young
man
after
he
had
seen
the
portrait
but
papa
what
was
in
the
lead
casket
till
he
opened
it
quite
sure
gracie
said
my
father
stroking
my
hair
well
my
dear
i
always
believed
that
nerissa
gave
him
a
hint
chapter
xliii
i
think
if
any
thing
was
to
be
foreseen
i
have
as
sharp
a
look
out
as
another
and
yet
i
foresee
nothing
good
natured
man
kate
and
i
had
a
busy
early
morning
of
it
there
was
the
sitting
room
to
put
in
order
and
coax
into
comfortable
looks
and
the
fire
to
make
and
this
too
in
very
good
season
before
any
one
else
could
be
up
similar
kind
offices
must
be
performed
for
the
breakfast
room
which
was
however
much
less
amenable
to
coaxing
do
what
we
would
it
was
but
a
bright
fire
some
lumber
room
chairs
of
which
the
original
striking
colours
were
much
worn
off
and
the
breakfast
table
standing
on
a
centre
piece
of
carpet
with
a
broad
border
of
bare
floor
the
floor
was
very
the
table
we
did
thank
mr
pratt
in
our
hearts
for
supposing
we
might
have
a
friend
with
us
had
its
old
supply
of
linen
china
and
silver
minus
the
tea
set
and
yet
it
looked
very
little
like
our
breakfast
room
though
that
stream
of
sunlight
was
certainly
heartsome
as
we
remarked
to
each
other
and
fairer
than
had
ever
entered
our
town
house
if
one
could
only
get
here
without
coming
through
that
empty
drawing
room
kate
said
never
mind
this
will
look
all
the
brighter
we
left
the
room
to
get
warm
at
its
leisure
and
went
to
see
about
breakfast
mrs
howard
had
preceded
us
in
this
department
but
there
were
still
some
light
matters
for
us
to
do
while
she
would
do
others
that
she
thought
less
pleasant
those
finished
we
took
off
our
aprons
and
proceeded
to
the
parlour
i
suppose
the
quick
work
and
early
rising
in
the
cold
may
have
made
us
look
pale
or
tired
mr
rodney

man

exclaimed
what
in
the
world
have
you
been
about
we
gave
him
our
lips
by
way
of
good
morning
and
answer
but
while
i
seated
myself
at
the
corner
of
the
fire
my
father
held
kate
fast
and
repeated
his
question
what
have
you
been
about
i
have
been
among
the
flours
just
now
said
kate
looking
down
and
smothering
a
laugh
doing
what
they
wanted
to
be
turned
in
a
new
direction
or
at
least
they
were
too
aspiring
i
have
been
reducing
them
within
proper
limits
at
this
time
of
day
said
my
father
the
only
time
of
day
when
they
usually
flourish
sir
the
flours
of
an
hour
which
is
popularly
called
breakfast
time
by
some
people
this
species
is
denominated
muffinaria
matinensis
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
the
laugh
burst
forth
in
good
earnest
the
gentlemen
laughed
too
because
they
could
said
my
father
what
do
you
mean
are
those
the
only
flowers
you
have
been
attending
to
not
quite
papa
i
have
managed
to
pick
up
a
little
heartsease
my
father
drew
her
to
him
for
another
kiss
but
looked
as
if
he
had
found
less
than
a
little
what
have
you
done
with
your
muffinaria
o
they
are
safe
said
kate
smiling
though
the
bright
tears
were
ready
to
fall
i
have
delivered
them
into
the
delicate
hands
of
dency
barrington

insisted
that
mine
were
too
robust
for

did
you

my

said
kate
you
have
certainly
taken
up
whose
rule
was
it
for
obtaining
information
this
morning
suppose
i
were
to
give
what
is
called
a

jan
lines
to
the
memory
of
patrick
kelley
who
by
his
many
good
qualities
during
some
years
residence
in
my
family
greatly
endeared
himself
to
me
and
mine
from
erin
s
fair
isle
to
this
country
he
came
and
found
brothers
and
sisters
to
welcome
him
here
though
then
but
a
youth
yet
robust
seemed
his
frame
and
life
promised
fair
for
many
around
the
same
board
he
with
two
of
his
sisters
did
constantly
meet
and
when
his
day
s
work
had
all
been
performed
at
the
same
fireside
he
found
a
third
seat
his
faithfulness
such
so
true
hearted
was
he
that
love
in
return
could
not
be
denied
as
one
of
the
family
he
soon
ceased
to
be
the
stranger
who
lately
for
work
had
applied
youth
passed
into
manhood
and
with
it
there
came
new
duties
to
fill
new
plans
to
pursue
but
a
fatal
disease
now
seizes
his
frame
and
with
health
is
his
strength
fast
leaving
him
too
from
his
home
in
the
country
to
the
city
he
went
where
kind
brothers
procured
him
good
medical
aid
but
all
was
in
vain
death
commissioned
was
sent
and
soon
his
remains
in
the
cold
grave
were
laid
the
broad
waves
of
atlantic
lie
rolling
between
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
parents
on
earth
and
never
by
parents
may
those
children
be
seen
or
the
latter
revisit
the
land
of
their
birth
that
region
of
darkness
from
whence
none
return

feb
for
my
grandsons
eddy
and
ally
i
here
engage
upon
this
page
a
picture
to
portray
of
two
of
an
age
yet
neither
a
loves
to
play
and
have
his
own
way
yet
i
m
happy
to
say
they
quarrel
if
ever
but
seldom
though
competent
quite
to
maintain
their
own
right
and
even
to
fight
yet
peace
to
their
bosom
is
welcome
both
go
to
school
and
learn
by
rule
that
he
consented
and
when
the
bibles
were
brought
home
the
exclamations
of
derision
from
the
misses
fairland
were
loud
and
long
a
missionary
in
disguise
they
exclaimed
a
saint
in
the
form
of
a
governess
come
to
convert
us
all
and
the
first
thing
is
an
importation
of
bibles
and
many
were
the
sneering
and
sarcastic
remarks
and
allusions
which
came
to
the
ears
of
agnes
but
she
kept
on
her
way
quiet
and
undisturbed
agnes
was
perfectly
astonished
to
find
how
utterly
unacquainted
these
children
were
with
the
contents
of
the
bible
it
was
all
new
to
them
and
after
she
had
read
to
them
every
morning
she
would
gather
them
around
her
and
tell
them
in
simple
language
the
sweet
stories
from
the
bible
while
they
listened
the
younger
ones
with
their
bright
they
could
not
lose
a
word
and
even
poor
tiney
loved
to
lay
her
head
in
agnes
lap
and
hear
of
him
who
ever
sympathised
with
the
sick
and
suffering
it
was
very
strange
and
very
interesting
to
agnes
to
hear
the
remarks
these
children
made
and
the
many
questions
they
would
ask
on
subjects
so
new
to
them
and
as
they
had
not
yet
learned
to
look
at
the
character
of
god
as
revealed
in
his
son
with
the
reverence
which
better
instructed
children
feel
they
often
spoke
of
him
as
they
would
of
any
good
man
of
whom
they
might
hear
and
in
a
way
which
would
seem
too
irreverential
were
i
to
tell
you
all
they
said
once
when
agnes
had
been
telling
them
of
some
of
the
miracles
of
our
saviour
in
curing
the
sick
and
giving
sight
to
the
blind
and
hearing
to
the
deaf
rosa
with
her
bright
black
eyes
fixed
intently
on
her
face
said
with
the
utmost
earnestness
why
he
was
said
agnes
always
good
and
kind
and
always
ready
to
help
the
sick
and
suffering
he
could
cure
anybody
could
nt
he
continued
rosa
yes
he
was
all
powerful
answered
agnes
could
he
cure
tiney
asked
jessie
yes
if
tiney
had
lived
when
christ
was
on
earth
or
if
he
was
here
now
he
could
say
the
word
and
make
her
well
and
then
they
asked
where
is
he
now
and
how
can
we
talk
to
him
now
and
why
will
he
not
cure
tiney
now
and
agnes
tried
in
the
most
simple
manner
to
teach
them
the
nature
of
the
prayer
of
faith
once
when
she
was
talking
to
them
of
our
saviour
s
meekness
under
injuries
and
telling
them
of
his
bitter
sufferings
and
the
kindness
of
his
feelings
towards
his
persecutors
the
large
tears
rolled
down
their
cheeks
and
rosa
made
a
practical
the
next
time
tiney
pinches
me
cousin
agnes
i
do
nt
mean
to
slap
her
back
again
nor
i
either
said
jessie
and
tiney
whispered
i
will
try
and
not
hurt
them
next
time
frank
who
had
been
choking
down
something
in
his
throat
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
is
it
all
true
every
word
of
it
franky
said
agnes
i
ve
got
something
in
my
eye
said
frank
rubbing
both
eyes
very
hard
with
the
back
of
his
hands
and
then
throwing
himself
on
the
settee
he
cried
bitterly
for
a
long
time
agnes
taught
them
many
pretty
hymns
and
as
they
all
had
good
voices
and
loved
music
dearly
they
were
never
so
happy
as
in
singing
morning
and
evening
these
sweet
hymns
with
agnes
even
poor
tiney
who
was
passionately
fond
of
music
readily
caught
the
tunes
though
it
was
first
sunday
that
agnes
passed
under
the
roof
of
mr
fairland
was
enough
to
convince
her
that
the
sabbath
day
with
them
was
passed
much
like
all
other
days
she
was
shocked
to
see
novels
and
other
light
and
trashy
works
in
the
lands
of
the
misses
fairland
on
this
holy
day
and
to
hear
them
howling
snatches
of
opera
tunes
as
they
ran
up
and
down
the
stairs
these
young
ladies
sometimes
went
to
church
in
the
morning
to
be
sure
especially
if
they
had
lately
received
new
bonnets
from
the
city
which
they
wished
to
display
for
the
envy
or
admiration
of
their
neighbors
mrs
fairland
was
too
indolent
to
take
the
trouble
even
if
she
possessed
the
inclination
to
appear
at
church
and
mr
fairland
looked
upon
this
seventh
day
of
the
week
literally
as
a
day
of
rest
in
which
to
recruit
the
exhausted
energies
of
the
body
in
preparation
for
the
labors
of
another
week
the
day
was
passed
by
him
in
looking
over
the
newspapers
or
sleeping
over
his
head
and
towards
evening
he
usually
took
a
stroll
over
to
his
mills
or
around
his
grounds
to
mark
out
what
was
necessary
to
be
done
on
the
coming
week
agnes
felt
the
importance
of
exerting
in
this
ungodly
family
a
strictly
religious
influence
but
except
with
her
own
little
pupils
she
did
not
attempt
at
first
to
do
so
in
any
other
way
than
by
her
own
quiet
consistent
example
mr
fairland
was
much
surprised
when
agnes
requested
permission
to
take
the
children
to
church
with
her
he
readily
granted
it
however
as
he
invariably
did
the
wishes
of
agnes
and
from
that
time
mr
fairland
s
pew
had
at
least
four
or
five
occupants
on
the
morning
and
evening
of
the
sabbath
day
though
not
required
by
her
engagement
to
do
so
agnes
kept
the
children
with
her
on
sunday
reading
to
them
singing
with
them
or
telling
them
beautiful
bible
stories
and
those
pleasant
sabbaths
spent
with
her
they
never
forgot
nor
her
care
what
a
pleasant
day
sunday
is
exclaimed
little
rosa
i
never
knew
it
was
such
a
pleasant
day
before
it
s
cousin
agnes
makes
it
so
pleasant
said
blue
eyed
jessie
it
is
because
you
spend
it
as
god
directs
that
it
is
a
pleasant
day
to
you
dear
children
said
agnes
and
i
wish
you
to
remember
that
hard
he
wondered
whether
bill
sykes
would
make
his
arrows
of
hickory
he
wondered
whether
bill
s
brother
tom
would
nt
make
them
for
him
just
as
like
as
not
now
he
would
and
then
bill
would
be
sure
to
have
the
best
ones
too
bad
joe
wished
he
had
a
brother
too
he
wished
ph
e
w
what
s
that
a
bear
as
sure
as
you
are
alive
and
may
not
be
long
what
s
to
be
done
now
joe
was
a
nice
fat
little
boy
and
the
bear
might
be
hungry
he
was
nt
afraid
afraid
they
are
made
of
different
stuff
than
the
little
ruffled
collar
boys
that
tag
about
with
the
nursery
maid
at
their
heels
in
broadway
joe
examined
his
jack
knife
and
took
another
look
at
the
bear
as
he
lay
behind
the
bushes
old
bruin
was
fast
asleep
all
right
joe
s
mother
would
nt
have
to
wait
for
her
flat
irons
so
he
stepped
carefully
along
not
to
disturb
bruin
s
nap
and
reached
aunt
elsie
s
with
a
whole
skin
aunt
elsie
was
very
glad
to
see
joe
for
she
loved
children
and
always
ran
to
the
cupboard
to
get
them
a
piece
of
wholesome
frontier
pie
or
gingerbread
or
bit
of
hoe
cake
but
joe
said
he
could
nt
stop
because
his
mother
had
her
clothes
already
sprinkled
and
folded
ready
for
the
irons
and
had
told
him
to
hurry
back
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
did
he
tell
aunt
elsie
about
the
bear
do
you
suppose
a
frontier
boy
would
take
refuge
under
a
woman
s
apron
a
thing
to
him
he
would
tuck
up
his
pinafore
roll
up
his
jacket
sleeves
and
show
you
his
little
brown
fists
in
a
trice
no
sir
he
never
alluded
to
the
bear
but
taking
a
flat
iron
in
each
hand
went
whistling
along
as
if
no
such
animal
had
ever
walked
out
of
noah
s
ark
into
the
back
woods
well
he
had
got
through
hail
columbia
and
auld
lang
syne
when
he
spied
bruin
again
and
this
time
he
was
wide
awake
too
he
began
whistling
yankee
doodle
first
to
show
his
independence
and
secondly
because
he
knew
if
anything
would
take
the
nonsense
out
of
the
letter
b
it
was
yankee
doodle
i
ll
iron
him
with
these
flat
irons
anyhow
said
joe
to
himself
if
he
comes
here
to
eat
me
but
whether
the
bear
was
nt
hungry
or
whether
he
did
nt
like
the
looks
of
the
flat
irons
or
whether
joe
s
was
all
three
i
ca
nt
say
all
i
know
is
that
he
never
touched
a
paw
to
him
and
joe
and
his
flat
irons
arrived
home
in
perfect
safety
i
m
so
glad
you
are
come
joe
said
his
mother
taking
the
irons
and
putting
them
over
the
fire
to
heat
i
ve
a
heap
of
work
to
do
and
besides
i
felt
uneasy
like
after
you
went
off
alone
through
the
woods
for
fear
you
might
possibly
meet
a
bear
i
did
said
joe
quietly
whittling
away
at
his
arrow
did
sakes
alive
where
how
when
did
he
bite
you
and
she
caught
him
up
by
the
waistband
and
held
him
up
to
the
light
and
turned
him
round
to
see
where
he
was
damaged
joe
told
her
all
about
it
and
she
flew
and
bolted
all
the
doors
and
every
now
and
then
she
d
set
down
her
flat
iron
and
putting
her
arms
a
kimbo
had
ate
him
up
that
night
she
insisted
on
his
eating
a
whole
pie
for
supper
gave
him
two
lumps
of
white
sugar
and
put
an
extra
blanket
on
his
bed
and
all
night
long
she
was
traveling
back
and
forth
in
her
night
cap
from
her
bed
to
his
to
feel
if
joe
was
safe
between
the
sheets
now
while
joe
s
asleep
if
you
like
that
story
i
will
tell
you
another
about
aunt
elsie
one
day
she
went
to
her
door
and
blew
her
horn
as
if
all
creation
was
let
loose
you
know
i
told
you
that
when
frontier
folks
want
to
call
the
neighbors
together
that
s
the
way
they
manage
well
there
was
a
general
stampede
to
see
what
was
to
pay
with
aunt
elsie
some
said
the
bears
must
have
run
off
with
her
little
girl
some
said
an
indian
might
have
strayed
into
her
log
hut
and
frightened
her
some
said
the
house
might
be
on
aunt
elsie
as
long
as
there
was
a
timber
left
of
them
whatever
was
to
pay
zeke
smith
said
zeke
was
an
old
bachelor
that
he
d
thought
for
a
great
while
that
it
was
nt
safe
for
elsie
to
live
there
alone
without
some
man
to
protect
her
and
jim
brown
who
was
a
widower
said
it
was
a
lonesome
piece
of
business
and
no
mistake
and
they
all
rushed
through
the
woods
to
see
which
should
pitch
into
the
house
first
and
help
her
the
fastest
well
what
do
you
think
was
to
pay
when
they
got
there
her
old
cow
was
choking
with
a
turnip
now
i
m
going
to
tell
you
one
more
backwoods
story
while
i
m
about
it
a
great
roaring
fire
was
burning
in
zeke
smith
s
log
house
and
all
the
tims
and
joes
and
bills
and
jacks
and
sams
had
come
in
to
see
him
they
peeled
chestnuts
and
threw
the
shells
into
the
the
blaze
lit
up
all
their
weather
beaten
bronzed
faces
and
they
drank
cider
out
of
a
great
mug
and
talked
about
one
thing
and
another
that
you
and
i
do
nt
care
about
and
then
zeke
smith
said
he
lost
a
sheep
last
night
so
did
i
said
pete
parker
i
lost
two
hens
said
joachim
jones
i
lost
a
ram
said
bill
bond
do
nt
say
so
said
zeke
well
that
is
a
loss
there
s
a
bear
about
that
s
certain
and
it
s
to
and
lean
upon
the
colonization
society
as
their
protector
and
guide
when
twenty
years
after
and
with
the
consent
of
their
early
guardian
declared
themselves
an
independent
nation
how
many
more
mercies
had
they
to
acknowledge
chapter
vii
a
liberian
visits
america
he
that
bears
himself
like
a
gentleman
is
worth
to
have
been
born
a
gentleman
chapman
after
the
first
few
years
of
trial
the
accounts
from
liberia
were
so
encouraging
that
nathan
yielded
to
the
earnest
entreaties
of
junius
and
emigrated
to
africa
with
his
family
at
mr
peyton
s
request
junius
continued
to
write
to
him
frequently
and
keep
him
informed
of
all
that
happened
of
interest
in
the
community
and
more
especially
in
the
two
households
that
had
once
been
members
of
mr
peyton
s
family
hardly
a
letter
came
without
bringing
some
confirmation
of
the
increasing
stability
and
prosperity
of
the
colonists
every
step
they
took
was
a
step
upward
and
onward
he
became
convinced
that
the
great
problem
which
had
occupied
so
much
of
his
thoughts
was
at
last
solved
and
that
in
africa
the
african
might
be
allowed
to
when
in
liberia
proclaimed
itself
a
free
and
independent
nation
no
one
welcomed
it
more
warmly
into
its
new
rank
as
a
republic
than
did
mr
peyton
not
long
after
this
important
event
he
passed
a
few
weeks
in
philadelphia
he
had
heard
nothing
of
ben
or
clara
for
two
or
three
years
and
had
supposed
them
prosperously
employed
all
that
time
he
was
troubled
at
the
condition
in
which
he
found
them
though
it
was
so
superior
to
the
one
from
which
mr
lyndsay
had
rescued
them
wishing
to
excite
in
them
a
desire
to
share
the
privileges
which
nathan
was
enjoying
he
sent
them
the
letters
he
had
received
from
junius
most
of
which
were
filled
with
accounts
of
the
happiness
and
comfort
in
which
his
father
s
family
were
living
he
succeeded
so
far
as
to
awaken
an
interest
in
them
as
to
all
the
concerns
of
liberia
but
he
could
not
arouse
in
ben
enough
energy
to
induce
him
to
leave
even
the
poor
home
which
was
all
he
could
hope
americus
was
a
great
obstacle
to
mr
peyton
s
wishes
he
had
returned
from
france
quite
a
finished
gentleman
in
manners
and
appearance
and
with
his
ideas
of
his
own
consequence
greatly
exalted
and
he
scouted
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
comforts
of
civilized
life
to
use
his
own
words
to
live
in
cabins
and
fight
with
savages
the
united
states
was
his
native
land
he
had
as
much
right
to
all
the
advantages
he
could
derive
from
living
in
it
as
any
other
of
its
citizens
and
he
was
not
going
basely
to
give
up
his
rights
but
rather
to
nail
his
flag
to
the
mast
and
demand
them
there
was
a
better
time
coming
the
hour
would
surely
arrive
however
long
delayed
it
might
be
when
the
distinctions
of
white
and
black
would
be
unknown
and
man
would
be
estimated
by
his
own
intrinsic
worth
speeches
like
these
had
a
great
effect
on
ben
clara
like
most
women
looking
to
the
immediate
and
practical
rather
that
time
would
do
to
them
if
as
americus
observed
generations
must
pass
away
before
that
state
of
things
could
be
looked
for
while
you
are
talking
about
it
and
waiting
for
it
here
said
she
nathan
and
polydore
are
helping
it
forward
in
africa
for
in
liberia
whites
and
blacks
do
meet
in
terms
of
equality
or
rather
the
colored
people
are
the
most
important
persons
there
and
that
is
the
only
christian
place
i
ever
heard
of
where
that
is
the
case
americus
had
heard
of
several
others
but
he
seemed
willing
to
make
a
trial
of
none
of
them
he
was
determined
he
said
to
live
and
die
in
america
and
no
colonizationist
should
force
him
to
leave
it
i
am
sure
you
are
welcome
to
stay
here
if
you
like
said
clara
the
white
folks
are
too
glad
to
have
somebody
they
can
order
about
and
make
do
their
hard
work
to
i
would
like
to
go
where
i
can
be
as
good
as
any
body
else
i
know
nathan
and
keziah
very
well
they
have
too
much
sense
not
to
know
whether
it
is
better
for
them
to
be
there
than
here
and
they
would
nt
speak
so
well
of
it
if
they
did
not
like
it
have
you
never
heard
of
the
fox
that
lost
his
tail
in
the
trap
and
tried
to
persuade
his
companions
to
cut
off
theirs
too
asked
americus
yes
said
clara
but
i
ve
knowed
nathan
more
than
thirty
years
and
i
never
knowed
him
to
tell
a
lie
in
all
my
life
and
it
is
nt
likely
that
he
would
begin
now
ben
confirmed
clara
s
assertion
and
americus
himself
was
too
well
aware
of
its
truth
to
deny
it
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
in
clara
s
room
mr
peyton
was
sitting
with
his
wife
in
a
private
parlor
of
one
of
the
principal
hotels
in
philadelphia
reading
partly
to
from
different
periodicals
that
were
lying
on
the
table
around
him
as
particularly
struck
him
from
one
of
the
foreign
reviews
he
read
the
following
what
a
wonderful
continent
is
this
rounded
smooth
shored
africa
known
from
the
earliest
dawn
of
time
yet
so
unknown
the
granary
of
nations
yet
sterile
and
fruitless
as
the
sea
swarming
with
life
yet
dazzling
the
eyes
with
its
vast
tract
of
glittering
sand
north
america
first
seen
but
the
other
day
has
been
probed
from
end
to
end
its
philips
tecumsehs
and
montezumas
have
been
bridled
and
broken
by
the
white
man
but
africa
has
seen
no
cortez
or
even
a
de
soto
or
la
salle
wringing
favor
from
fate
some
solitary
mungo
park
or
faithful
lander
or
persevering
burekhardt
alone
has
tried
to
read
the
secret
of
the
mother
of
civilization
the
gray
haired
africa
if
we
seek
go
himself
alone
if
the
clerk
would
tell
him
in
what
part
of
the
town
it
was
so
the
clerk
gave
rollo
the
necessary
direction
and
rollo
went
forth
he
found
the
diligence
office
very
easily
in
fact
he
recognized
the
place
at
once
when
he
came
near
it
by
seeing
several
diligences
standing
before
it
along
the
street
he
entered
under
an
archway
on
entering
he
observed
several
doors
leading
to
various
offices
with
inscriptions
over
each
containing
the
names
of
the
various
towns
to
which
the
several
diligences
were
going
at
length
he
found
berne
rollo
did
not
know
precisely
in
what
way
the
business
at
such
an
office
was
to
be
transacted
but
he
had
learned
from
past
experience
that
all
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
make
himself
understood
in
such
involved
in
the
meaning
that
he
was
intending
to
convey
without
attempting
to
make
full
and
complete
sentences
of
them
in
cases
where
he
adopted
this
mode
of
speaking
he
was
accustomed
usually
to
begin
by
saying
that
he
could
not
speak
french
very
well
accordingly
in
this
instance
he
went
to
the
place
where
the
clerk
was
sitting
and
said
i
do
not
speak
french
very
well
diligence
to
berne
two
places
banquette
yes
yes
said
the
clerk
i
understand
very
well
the
clerk
then
told
him
what
the
price
would
be
of
two
seats
on
the
banquette
and
rollo
paid
the
money
the
clerk
then
made
out
and
signed
two
very
formal
receipts
and
gave
them
to
rollo
rollo
walked
back
towards
the
hotel
studying
his
receipts
by
the
way
but
he
could
not
understand
them
as
they
were
in
the
german
language
chapter
v
ride
to
berne
at
length
the
time
arrived
for
the
departure
of
our
two
travellers
from
to
the
diligence
office
while
rollo
and
mr
george
walked
when
they
got
to
the
place
they
found
the
diligence
in
the
archway
and
several
men
were
employed
in
carrying
up
trunks
and
carpet
bags
to
the
top
of
it
and
stowing
them
away
there
in
doing
this
they
ascended
and
descended
by
means
of
a
long
step
ladder
the
men
took
mr
george
s
trunk
and
rollo
s
and
packed
them
away
with
the
rest
there
were
several
persons
who
looked
like
passengers
standing
near
waiting
apparently
for
the
diligence
to
be
ready
among
them
were
two
children
a
girl
and
a
boy
who
seemed
to
be
about
rollo
s
age
they
were
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
they
were
sitting
on
a
chest
the
boy
had
a
shawl
over
his
arm
and
the
girl
had
a
small
morocco
travelling
bag
in
her
hand
the
girl
looked
a
moment
at
rollo
as
he
came
up
the
archway
and
then
cast
her
eyes
down
again
her
eyes
were
blue
and
they
were
a
certain
gentleness
in
the
expression
of
her
countenance
which
led
rollo
to
think
that
she
must
be
a
kindhearted
and
amiable
girl
the
boy
looked
at
rollo
too
and
followed
him
some
time
with
his
eyes
gazing
at
him
as
he
came
up
the
archway
with
a
look
of
interest
and
curiosity
it
was
not
yet
quite
time
for
the
diligence
to
set
out
in
fact
the
horses
were
not
yet
harnessed
to
it
and
during
the
interval
rollo
and
mr
george
stood
by
watching
the
process
of
getting
the
coach
ready
for
the
journey
and
contrasting
the
appearance
of
the
vehicle
and
of
the
men
employed
about
it
and
the
arrangements
which
they
were
making
with
the
corresponding
particulars
in
the
setting
off
of
a
stage
coach
as
they
had
witnessed
it
in
america
while
doing
this
rollo
walked
about
the
premises
a
little
and
at
length
finding
himself
near
the
two
children
on
the
chest
he
concluded
to
venture
to
accost
the
boy
are
you
going
in
this
diligence
replied
the
boy
so
am
i
said
rollo

the
boy
he
spoke
the
yes
in
english

to
berne
asked
rollo
i
do
nt
know
said
the
boy
the
girl
who
had
been
looking
at
rollo
during
this
conversation
here
spoke
and
said
that
they
were
going
to
berne
we
are
going
in
that
diligence
said
she
so
am
i
said
rollo
i
have
got
a
seat
on
the
banquette
yes
rejoined
the
boy
i
wished
to
have
a
seat
on
the
banquette
so
that
i
could
see
but
the
seats
were
all
engaged
before
my
father
went
to
the
office
so
we
are
going
in
the
coupe
but
i
do
nt
like
it
half
so
well
nor
i
said
the
girl
where
is
your
father
asked
boy
with
mother
to
buy
something
at
a
shop
a
little
way
from
here
lottie
and
i
were
tired
and
so
we
preferred
to
stay
here
but
they
are
coming
back
pretty
soon
are
you
all
going
to
ride
in
the
coupe
said
rollo
because
there
will
not
be
room
there
is
only
room
for
three
in
the
coupe
i
know
it
said
lottie
but
then
as
two
of
us
are
children
father
thought
that
we
could
get
along
father
had
a
plan
for
getting
adolphus
a
seat
in
the
interior
but
he
was
not
willing
to
go
there
because
he
said
he
could
not
see
just
at
this
moment
the
father
and
mother
of
adolphus
and
lottie
came
up
the
archway
into
the
court
yard
where
the
diligence
was
standing
the
horses
had
been
brought
out
some
minutes
before
and
were
now
nearly
harnessed
the
gentleman
seemed
to
be
quite
in
a
hurry
as
he
came
up
he
said
now
children
get
in
and
take
your
places
as
soon
as
possible
so
they
all
went
to
the
coach
and
the
gentleman
attempted
to
open
the
door
leading
to
the
coupe
it
was
fastened
conductor
said
he
speaking
very
eagerly
to
the
conductor
who
was
standing
near
open
this
door
there
is
plenty
of
time
said
the
conductor
there
is
no
need
of
haste
and
to
the
height
of
three
or
four
feet
from
the
ground
in
the
effort
to
maintain
themselves
and
i
have
known
the
high
blueberry
bushes
about
the
shore
which
commonly
produce
no
fruit
bear
an
abundant
crop
under
these
circumstances
some
have
been
puzzled
to
tell
how
the
shore
became
so
regularly
paved
my
townsmen
have
all
heard
the
tradition
the
oldest
people
tell
me
that
they
heard
it
in
their
youth
hill
here
which
rose
as
high
into
the
heavens
as
the
pond
now
sinks
deep
into
the
earth
and
they
used
much
profanity
as
the
story
goes
though
this
vice
is
one
of
which
the
indians
were
never
guilty
and
while
they
were
thus
engaged
the
hill
shook
and
suddenly
sank
and
only
one
old
squaw
named
walden
escaped
and
from
her
the
pond
was
named
it
has
been
conjectured
that
when
the
hill
shook
these
stones
rolled
down
its
side
and
became
the
present
shore
it
is
very
certain
at
any
rate
that
once
there
was
no
pond
here
and
now
there
is
one
and
this
indian
fable
does
not
in
any
respect
conflict
with
the
account
of
that
ancient
settler
whom
i
have
mentioned
who
remembers
so
well
when
he
first
came
here
with
his
divining
rod
saw
a
thin
vapor
rising
from
the
sward
and
the
hazel
pointed
steadily
downward
and
he
concluded
to
dig
a
well
here
as
for
the
stones
many
still
think
that
they
are
waves
on
these
hills
but
i
observe
that
the
surrounding
hills
are
remarkably
full
of
the
same
kind
of
stones
so
that
they
have
been
obliged
to
pile
them
up
in
walls
on
both
sides
of
the
railroad
cut
nearest
the
pond
and
moreover
there
are
most
stones
where
the
shore
is
most
abrupt
so
that
unfortunately
it
is
no
longer
a
mystery
to
me
i
detect
the
paver
if
the
name
was
not
derived
from
that
of
some
english
locality
saffron
walden
for
instance
one
might
suppose
that
it
was
called
originally
walled
in
pond
the
pond
was
my
well
ready
dug
for
four
months
in
the
year
its
water
is
as
cold
as
it
is
pure
at
all
times
and
i
think
that
it
is
then
as
good
as
any
if
not
the
best
in
the
town
in
the
winter
all
water
which
is
exposed
to
the
air
is
colder
than
springs
and
wells
which
are
protected
from
it
the
temperature
of
the
pond
water
which
had
stood
in
afternoon
till
noon
the
next
day
the
sixth
of
march
the
thermometer
having
been
up
to
x
or
x
some
of
the
time
owing
partly
to
the
sun
on
the
roof
was
x
or
one
degree
colder
than
the
water
of
one
of
the
coldest
wells
in
the
village
just
drawn
the
temperature
of
the
boiling
spring
the
same
day
was
x
or
the
warmest
of
any
water
tried
though
it
is
the
coldest
that
i
know
of
in
summer
when
beside
shallow
and
stagnant
surface
water
is
not
mingled
with
it
moreover
in
summer
walden
never
becomes
so
warm
as
most
water
which
is
exposed
to
the
sun
on
account
of
its
depth
in
the
warmest
weather
i
usually
placed
a
pailful
in
my
cellar
where
it
became
cool
in
the
night
and
remained
so
during
the
day
though
i
also
resorted
to
a
spring
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
as
good
when
a
week
old
as
the
day
it
was
dipped
and
had
no
taste
of
by
the
shore
of
a
pond
needs
only
bury
a
pail
of
water
a
few
feet
deep
in
the
shade
of
his
camp
to
be
independent
of
the
luxury
of
ice
there
have
been
caught
in
walden
pickerel
one
weighing
seven
pounds
to
say
nothing
of
another
which
carried
off
a
reel
with
great
velocity
which
the
fisherman
safely
set
down
at
eight
pounds
because
he
did
not
see
him
perch
and
pouts
some
of
each
weighing
over
two
pounds
shiners
chivins
or
roach
leuciscus
pulchellus
a
very
few
breams
and
a
couple
of
eels
one
weighing
four
pounds
i
am
thus
particular
because
the
weight
of
a
fish
is
commonly
its
only
title
to
fame
and
these
are
the
only
eels
i
have
heard
of
here
also
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
a
little
fish
some
five
inches
long
with
silvery
sides
and
a
greenish
back
somewhat
dace
like
in
its
character
which
i
mention
here
chiefly
to
link
my
facts
to
fable
nevertheless
this
pond
though
not
abundant
are
its
chief
boast
i
have
seen
at
one
time
lying
on
the
ice
pickerel
of
at
least
three
different
kinds
a
long
and
shallow
one
steel
colored
most
like
those
caught
in
the
river
a
bright
golden
kind
with
greenish
reflections
and
remarkably
deep
which
is
the
most
common
here
and
another
golden
colored
and
shaped
like
the
last
but
peppered
on
the
sides
with
small
dark
brown
or
black
spots
intermixed
with
a
few
faint
blood
red
ones
very
much
like
a
trout
the
specific
name
reticulatus
would
not
apply
to
this
it
should
be
guttatus
rather
these
are
all
very
firm
fish
and
weigh
more
than
their
size
promises
the
shiners
pouts
and
perch
also
and
indeed
all
the
fishes
which
inhabit
this
pond
are
much
cleaner
handsomer
and
firmer
fleshed
than
those
in
the
river
and
most
other
ponds
as
the
water
is
purer
and
they
can
easily
be
distinguished
from
them
probably
many
ichthyologists
would
make
new
varieties
of
of
frogs
and
tortoises
and
a
few

muskrats

their

drawing
my
head
to
her
bosom
she
soothed
me
with
more
than
a
mother
s
gentleness
till
tears
subsided
into
sobs
and
at
last
wearied
out
by
the
violence
of
my
emotion
i
fell
asleep
there
kneeling
on
the
floor
by
her
side
but
weeks
passed
on
and
a
change
for
the
better
seemed
to
have
taken
place
norah
s
eye
became
less
bright
her
cheek
less
deeply
flushed
and
we
almost
thought
our
lily
flower
would
brighten
and
bloom
once
more
with
other
lilies
in
the
sunshine
of
another
summer
horace
talked
hopefully
of
the
sweet
cottage
he
would
build
and
the
roses
and
jasmine
she
should
twine
over
its
porch
and
windows
when
she
was
well
would
add
once
more
she
passed
over
her
shoulder
the
ribbon
of
her
guitar
and
played
lively
cheerful
airs
though
she
was
too
weak
to
sing
much
but
she
would
laugh
and
say
i
shall
be
singing
in
a
few
weeks
better
than
ever
and
we
did
nt
believe
her
mrs
lee
s
face
brightened
and
her
steps
grew
quick
and
cheerful
and
even
grandmother
when
she
used
to
come
to
the
cottage
and
bring
the
nice
little
things
that
norah
loved
would
look
at
her
with
a
smile
on
her
kind
motherly
face
and
say
that
it
was
a
lazy
little
girl
who
liked
petting
and
it
must
come
over
after
its
own
cakes
pretty
paradise
was
to
adam
a
whistling
sound
he
heard
in
the
air
and
then
the
whip
stinging
with
the
malignity
of
concentrated
spite
fell
quick
upon
his
unguarded
shoulders
to
his
deep
shame
and
astonishment
and
pain
jumping
down
as
quick
as
he
could
he
stood
on
the
pavement
an
injured
and
indignant
man
and
fiercely
demanded
the
cause
of
the
outrage
the
farmer
had
mistaken
him
for
a
boy
and
profuse
of
apology
endeavored
to
appease
the
little
lion
of
the
brush
by
stating
his
annoyance
by
the
boys
to
say
nothing
of
his
loss
by
biters
and
his
determination
to
put
a
stop
to
it
by
the
summary
means
he
had
given
suds
a
taste
of
suds
was
nearly
right
even
while
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
remembered
pain
and
they
parted
on
as
good
terms
as
the
circumstances
would
admit
of
unfortunately
for
the
peace
of
the
little
man
a
neighbor
who
loved
to
stir
up
suds
had
seen
the
castigation
and
each
day
as
he
came
to
be
shaved
would
he
ask
with
the
tenderest
solicitude
did
it
hurt
you
much
always
after
shaving
however
for
his
nose
would
certainly
have
been
in
the
way
during
the
agitation
the
question
produced
had
he
asked
it
before
that
question
so
sneeringly
asked
human
nature
could
nt
stand
it
patience
could
nt
stand
it
suds
could
nt
stand
it
and
that
question
was
a
declaration
of
war
with
all
who
put
it
to
him
continual
dropping
will
wear
a
stone
one
day
suds
was
splitting
wood
in
the
back
yard
like
a
dentist
working
away
among
the
old
stumps
fretting
at
the
unrivable
tenacity
with
which
they
held
together
point
of
yielding
he
swung
it
above
his
head
to
bring
it
down
upon
a
block
and
thus
force
the
axe
effectively
through
the
tough
fibres
the
axe
with
the
wood
adhering
was
raised
aloft
the
blow
was
about
to
be
struck
but
slipping
from
the
iron
the
block
took
another
direction
and
fell
heavily
upon
the
hatless
poll
of
the
unfortunate
barber
his
wife
had
seen
the
whole
proceeding
from
the
window
and
rushing
out
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
damage
she
anxiously
inquired
mr
suds
did
it
hurt
you
much
to
say
that
fire
flashed
from
his
eyes
would
be
inadequate
chain
lightning
alone
could
typify
the
glance
he
gave
the
solicitous
mrs
s
and
a
small
thunderbolt
like
a
billet
of
wood
darted
upon
the
wings
of
a
fierce
anathema
at
her
devoted
head
she
dodged
the
missile
and
a
smashed
window
remained
a
monument
of
his
passion
poor
suds
he
soon
removed
from
that
locality
and
the
little
shop
obliterated
by
the
huge
granite
piles
that
indicate
the
progressiveness
of
commerce
fare
ma
am
how
do
you
do
dear
said
mrs
partington
smilingly
shaking
hands
with
burbank
in
the
dock
square
omnibus
as
he
held
out
his
five
dexter
digits
towards
her
fare
ma
am
said
he
in
reply
to
her
inquiry
well
i
m
shore
i
m
glad
of
it
and
how
are
the
folks
at
home
fare
ma
am
continued
he
still
extending
his
hand
the
passengers
were
interested
how
do
you
like
boston
screamed
she
as
the
omnibus
rattled
over
the
stones
fare
ma
am
shouted
he
without
drawing
back
his
hand
i
want
you
to
pay
me
for
your
ride
o
murmured
she
i
thought
it
was
some
one
that
knowed
me
and
rummaged
down
in
the
bottom
of
her
reticule
for
a
ticket
finding
at
her
handkerchief
the
last
war
handkerchief
with
the
stars
and
stripes
involved
in
it
and
the
action
of
the
constitution
and
guerriere
stamped
upon
it
but
the
smile
she
had
given
him
at
first
was
not
withdrawn
there
was
no
allowance
made
for
mistakes
at
that
counter
and
he
went
out
with
a
lighter
heart
and
a
heavier
pocket
to
catch
t
other
coach
paying
promptly
if
there
is
any
place
in
this
world
where
i
like
to
ransack
business
more
than
another
said
mrs
partington
with
animation
untying
from
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
a
sum
of
money
she
had
just
received
if
there
s
any
place
better
than
another
it
s
a
bank
there
s
no
dillydalliance
and
beating
down
and
bothering
you
with
a
thousand
questions
till
you
do
nt
know
whether
your
heels
are
up
or
your
head
is
down
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
put
your
bill
on
the
counter
and
they
pay
it
without
a
check
for
a
quarter
s
pension
money
received
on
account
of
paul
who
in
the
last
war
served
a
fortnight
in
fortifying
boston
harbor
and
got
mortar
in
his
eyes
which
hurt
his
visionary
organs
so
that
he
took
to
glasses
memento
mory
before
old
roger
left
boarding
at
no
he
forfeited
all
regard
of
the
quiet
inmates
of
the
house
by
the
perpetration
of
the
following
atrocity
which
was
the
true
reason
of
his
leaving
and
not
the
quality
of
the
bread
pudding
as
many
believed
mory
the
kilby
street
clerk
got
married
and
moved
off
it
had
always
been
a
custom
with
mory
to
pile
his
dishes
up
in
a
curious
manner
after
he
had
used
them
cups
saucers
plates
in
a
heterogeneous
heap
a
day
or
two
after
his
departure
from
the
house
old
roger
was
observed
piling
his
cup
and
saucer
and
plates
in
the
same
manner
and
he
took
those
of
his
neighbor
to
in
much
surprise
and
one
of
them
a
little
bolder
than
the
rest
ventured
to
ask
him
what
he
was
doing
that
for
o
said
roger
very
placidly
crowning
the
pile
he
had
made
with
the
cover
of
the
sugar
bowl
i
am
only
erecting
a
memento
mory
mr
blifkins
the
serious
man
exhorted
the
more
volatile
boarders
on
the
impropriety
of
laughing
at
such
an
outrageously
sacrilegious
use
of
a
respectable
dead
language
from
that
day
roger
had
cold
shoulder
for
dinner
and
the
coldness
of
the
landlady
became
suddenly
come
along
the
governor
is
in
i
see
so
saw
martin
also
it
was
the
same
polite
publisher
to
whom
he
had
first
submitted
the
manuscript
of
the
beggar
of
bagdad
with
what
distinctness
the
old
scenes
recurred
to
his
mind
he
wondered
if
he
whose
careless
words
all
in
the
way
of
business
had
fallen
like
a
blight
upon
the
flower
of
his
hope
remembered
that
epoch
it
appeared
not
the
publisher
gave
no
sign
of
recognizing
the
unsuccessful
aspirant
he
had
probably
forgotten
his
anxious
face
the
moment
it
disappeared
from
his
counting
room
under
the
cloud
of
disappointment
that
overshadowed
it
with
him
the
affair
had
been
a
mere
item
in
the
day
s
record
with
the
young
author
it
was
a
point
in
experience
prominent
as
mount
washington
among
new
england
hills
i
have
read
some
of
your
articles
said
the
judging
from
what
you
have
done
that
you
have
the
ability
to
undertake
something
of
greater
magnitude
with
no
less
success
i
need
not
say
replied
martin
that
it
would
afford
me
great
pleasure
to
prove
you
a
true
prophet
well
sir
you
may
have
the
opportunity
one
of
these
days
and
i
will
say
this
much
to
encourage
you
added
the
gracious
publisher
that
i
never
yet
erred
far
wide
in
my
estimate
of
what
a
writer
can
do
he
touched
martin
s
shoulder
significantly
i
have
nt
been
ten
years
in
the
trade
for
nothing
i
m
no
scholar
i
graduated
in
a
red
school
house
on
the
forks
of
the
road
and
could
nt
tell
you
greek
from
latin
nor
latin
from
algebra
but
when
you
come
to
commonsense
and
business
you
may
find
my
word
worth
a
trifle
when
i
say
you
have
the
ability
i
do
nt
mean
that
you
can
make
speeches
like
doctor
this
or
professor
that
but
that
you
can
write
a
book
that
our
friend
here
can
read
to
his
family
and
that
i
can
sell
martin
acknowledged
the
compliment
with
a
blush
a
bow
and
a
smile
what
we
want
in
books
is
nature
nature
nature
the
publisher
went
on
you
have
that
there
is
no
wild
romance
no
sentimental
extravagance
in
your
style
i
have
endeavored
to
steer
as
clear
of
that
as
possible
replied
martin
with
a
smile
he
thought
of
the
beggar
of
bagdad
i
have
had
experience
enough
to
teach
me
that
in
literature
we
can
not
give
our
pictures
of
life
and
the
human
heart
too
much
of
the
atmosphere
and
coloring
of
reality
true
we
must
idealize
but
all
our
elements
must
be
drawn
from
nature
and
reproduced
with
fidelity
with
a
moral
tone
suggested
the
other
i
think
literature
should
not
be
frivolous
it
should
said
martin
with
so
much
evil
in
the
world
to
be
overcome
with
good
with
so
much
ignorance
wrong
and
slavery
of
every
kind
to
be
combated
even
in
this
land
of
boasted
light
and
liberty
a
writer
should
not
trifle
but
i
do
not
believe
much
in
set
morals
attached
to
fictions
they
may
be
precious
as
gold
yet
a
freight
of
such
is
death
to
the
muse
i
think
when
an
author
s
heart
is
pure
it
will
breathe
purity
into
his
books
if
we
look
at
life
from
a
high
point
of
view
and
make
our
pictures
true
the
very
essence
of
morality
will
enter
into
them
though
we
should
paint
vice
itself
i
like
your
ideas
observed
the
publisher
now
if
you
choose
to
prepare
a
small
volume
in
the
course
of
the
winter
i
will
publish
it
for
you
in
the
spring
call
in
any
day
next
week
and
i
will
give
you
some
hints
that
made
martin
s
eyes
glisten
yet
he
could
not
help
saying
that
he
was
afraid
the
publisher
might
regret
the
confidence
he
saw
fit
to
place
in
him
i
have
no
fears
on
that
score
responded
the
latter
only
make
a
book
to
suit
yourself
and
i
shall
be
suited
if
i
suit
myself
it
will
be
for
the
first
time
cried
martin
i
have
never
yet
done
anything
that
seemed
to
me
worthy
often
before
i
sit
down
to
write
the
ideal
before
me
thrills
me
with
its
beauty
but
when
i
come
to
create
tangible
forms
it
escapes
out
of
them
by
some
subtlety
i
am
not
master
of
and
immediately
reppears
in
another
shape
so
beautiful
and
so
grand
that
i
take
shame
to
myself
for
my
poor
efforts
to
grasp
it
what
i
will
write
is
always
noble
what
i
have
written
is
shallow
and
feeble
i
think
now
i
can
write
you
a
good
book
but
if
i
beware
of
it
i
wrote
a
romance
once
it
was
my
first
attempt
at
prose
and
i
succeeded
so
much
better
than
i
expected
that
i
thought
it
a
fine
production
i
have
no
doubt
but
it
was
very
respectable
said
the
publisher
with
a
flattering
smile
he
had
most
assuredly
forgotten
the
beggar
of
bagdad
it
was
mere
trash
returned
martin
with
a
humorous
twinkle
of
the
eye
if
you
had
ever
seen
it
you
would
say
so
i
have
never
been
quite
so
vain
of
anything
since
the
publisher
bowed
his
visitors
out
of
his
shop
and
martin
went
away
arm
in
arm
with
his
friend
as
he
had
come
i
tell
you
said
he
warmly
i
left
this
goodly
place
one
year
ago
with
different
feelings
i
had
aimed
my
arrow
at
the
sun
of
fame
and
came
here
to
find
that
it
had
struck
into
the
flat
mud
of
utter
failure
you
dillistone
but
sir
you
must
serve
your
time
and
earn
your
creditmarks
and
sit
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
delay
if
literary
success
is
your
ambition
added
martin
and
here
we
will
leave
him
in
the
flush
of
a
fresh
and
hopeful
purpose
and
turn
our
eyes
to
other
actors
in
this
irregular
drama
cheesy
meanwhile
is
growing
a
little
in
and
twittering
birds
and
humming
bees
but
mingled
with
these
at
length
there
comes
to
her
attentive
ear
a
sound
or
the
suspicion
of
a
sound
of
distant
horse
hoofs
falling
upon
the
forest
leaves
it
draws
nearer
it
becomes
distinct
she
knows
it
now
it
is
it
is
a
troop
of
british
soldiers
approaching
the
house
they
rode
in
a
totally
undisciplined
and
disorderly
manner
reeling
in
their
saddles
drunken
with
debauchery
red
hot
reeking
from
some
scene
of
fire
and
blood
and
in
no
condition
to
be
operated
upon
by
edith
s
beautiful
and
holy
influences
they
galloped
into
the
yard
they
galloped
up
to
the
house
their
leader
threw
himself
heavily
from
his
horse
and
advanced
to
the
door
it
was
the
terrible
and
remorseless
thorg
no
one
could
doubt
the
identity
for
a
single
instant
the
low
square
built
thick
set
body
the
huge
head
the
bull
neck
heavy
jowl
coarse
sensual
lips
bloodshot
eyes
and
fiery
visage
surrounded
with
coarse
red
hair
the
whole
brutalized
demonized
that
cross
between
the
fiend
and
the
beast
called
thorg
and
now
he
came
intoxicated
inflamed
burning
with
fierce
passions
from
some
fell
scene
of
recent
violence
pale
as
death
and
nearly
as
calm
edith
awaited
his
coming
she
could
not
hope
to
influence
this
man
or
his
associates
she
knew
her
fate
now
it
was
death
death
by
her
own
hand
before
that
man
s
foot
should
profane
her
threshold
she
knew
her
fate
and
knowing
it
grew
calm
and
strong
there
were
no
more
hopes
or
fears
or
doubts
or
trepidations
over
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
the
spirit
ruled
victorious
and
edith
stood
revealed
to
herself
richly
endowed
with
that
heroism
she
had
so
worshiped
in
others
in
that
supreme
moment
mistress
of
herself
and
of
her
fate
to
die
by
her
own
hand
but
not
rashly
not
till
a
trial
should
be
made
not
till
the
last
moment
and
how
beautiful
in
this
last
fateful
moment
she
looked
the
death
pallor
had
passed
from
her
countenance
the
summer
breeze
was
lifting
brow
a
strange
elevation
irradiated
her
face
and
it
shone
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
angel
by
george
boys
what
a
pretty
wench
keep
back

d
d
rascals

dismounted
and
were
pressing

have
precedence
in
love

in
other
things

material
to
supply
my
men
with

edith
glanced
around
for
her
attendants
jenny
lay
upon
the
hall
floor
fallen
forward
upon
her
face
in
a
deep
swoon
oliver
stood
out
upon
the
lawn
his
teeth
chattering
and
his

knocking
together
with
terror
yet
faintly
meditating
a
desperate
onslaught
to
the
rescue
with
his
wooden
rake
no
matter
for
first
of
all
we
must
have
a
taste
of
those
dainty
lips

back
bl
t
you
he
vociferated
with
a
volley
of
appalling
oaths
crowding
behind
him
back
into
the
rear
we
would
be
alone
d
you
do
you
hear
the
drunken
soldiers
fell
back
and
he
advanced
toward
edith
who
stood
calm
in
desperate
resolution
she
raised
her
hand
to
supplicate
or
wave
him
off
he
did
not
care
which
her
other
hand
hanging
down
by
her
side
grasped
the
pistol
which
she
concealed
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
hear
me
she
said
one
moment
i
beseech

the
miscreant
paused

beauty

grace
before
meat
be
too
long
i
am
a
soldier
s
child
said
edith
her
sweet
clear
voice
slightly
quavering
like
the
strings
of
a
lute
over
which
the
wind
has
passed
i
am
a
soldier

child
my
father
died
gallantly
on

edith
s
fingers
closed
convulsively
upon
the
pistol
still
held
bidden
i
am
alone
and
defenseless
she
said
i
remained
here
voluntarily
to
protect
our
home
because
i
had
faith
in
the
better
feelings
of
men
when
they
should
be
appealed
to
i
had
heard
dreadful
tales
of
the
ravages
of
the
enemy
through
neighboring
sections
of
the
country
i
did
not
fully
believe
them
i
thought
them
the
exaggerations
of
terror
and
could
not
credit
the
worst
believing
as
i
did
the
british
nation
to
be
an
upright
and
honorable
enemy
british
soldiers
to
be
men
and
british
officers

i
trusted
in

you
not
let
me
and
my
servants
retire
in
peace
all
that
the
cellars
and
storehouses
of
luckenough
contain
is
at
your
disposal
you
will
leave
myself
and
attendants
unmolested
i
have
not
trusted
in
the
honor
of
british
soldiers
to
my
own
destruction
a
pretty
speech
my
dear
and
prettily
spoken
but
not
half
so
persuasive
as
the
sweet
wench
that
uttered
it
said
thorg
springing
toward
her
edith
suddenly
raised
the
pistol
an
expression
of
deadly
determination
upon
her
face
thorg
as
suddenly
fell
back
he
was
an
abominable
coward
in
addition
to
his
other
qualities

that
girl
seize
and
disarm
her
what
mean
you
rascals
are
you
to
be
foiled
by
a
girl
seize
and
disarm
her
i
say
are
you
men
yes
they
they
were
they
hesitated
to

upon
one
helpless
girl

l
fire
and
furies

disarm
her
i
say
vociferated
thorg
edith
stood
her
hand
still
forward
he
continued
in
a
tone
of
touching
sadness
i
had
determined
mary
to
keep
my
grief
locked
in
my
own
heart
and
never
to
let
words
of
love
pass
my
lips
but
the
thought
of
parting
with
you
forever
is
more
you
not
seen
for
weeks
and
months
how
i
have
loved
you
long
ago
when
first
we
met
a
deep
unutterable
love
stole
into
my
heart
i
fancied
for
a
time
that
you
returned
it
till
the
evening
we
met
at
my
sister
s
and
you
spoke
with
such
indifference
of
leaving
me
behind
i
saw
then
i
had
flattered
myself
falsely
that
you
entertained
none
save
friendly
feelings
toward
me
still
i
thought
in
time
you
might
learn
to
regard
me
with
warmer
sentiments
so
i
hoped
on
till
the
evening
of
our
last
ride
when
your
agitation
led
me
to
suppose
you
loved
another
i
saw
you
meet
mr
stewart
and
was
confirmed
in
my
supposition
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
ever
winning
your
affection
in
return
now
i
see
my
error
in
believing
for
a
moment
that
you
felt
otherwise
to
him
than
as
a
brother
as
the
betrothed
of
your
cousin
i
know
that
you
have
never
loved
him
and
pardon
my
error
when
i
and
in
absence
and
varied
and
exciting
pursuits
to
shut
out
from
my
heart
the
memory
of
my
hopes
and
fears
mary
your
words
fill
me
with
inexpressible
anguish
oh
you
can
not
know
how
blank
and
dreary
earth
will
seem
when
you
are
gone
i
shall
have
no
hope
no
incitement
no
joy
as
she
listened
to
this
confession
which
a
month
before
would
have
brought
the
glow
to
her
cheek
and
sparkle
to
her
eye
she
felt
that
it
came
too
late
still
a
perfect
joy
stole
into
her
heart
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
and
gently
said
i
am
dying
and
feeling
as
i
do
that
few
hours
are
allotted
me
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
speak
freely
and
candidly
some
might
think
me
deviating
from
the
delicacy
of
my
sex
but
under
the
circumstances
i
feel
that
i
am
not
i
have
loved
you
long
and
to
know
that
my
love
is
returned
is
a
source
of
deep
to
suppose
i
ever
regarded
mr
stewart
otherwise
than
as
florry
s
future
husband
i
have
never
loved
but
one
mary
can
it
be
possible
that
you
have
loved
me
when
i
fancied
of
late
that
indifference
and
even
dislike
nestled
in
your
heart
we
shall
yet
be
happy
i
thank
god
that
we
shall
be
so
blest
and
he
pressed
the
thin
hand
to
his
lips
do
not
deceive
yourself
your
confession
has
come
too
late
i
can
never
be
yours
for
the
hand
of
death
is
already
laid
upon
me
and
my
spirit
will
wing
its
way
ere
long
home
to
god
now
that
we
understand
each
other
and
while
i
yet
live
let
us
be
as
calm
as
happy
as
the
circumstances
allow
it
may
seem
hard
that
i
should
be
taken
when
the
future
appears
so
bright
but
i
do
not
repine
neither
must
you
god
ever
good
and
merciful
sees
that
it
is
best
few
hours
left
us
by
vain
regrets
too
feeble
to
speak
more
she
closed
her
eyes
while
her
breathing
grew
painfully
short
dr
bryant
bent
forward
and
gently
lifting
her
head
supported
her
with
his
strong
arm
and
stroked
off
from
her
beautiful
brow
the
clustering
hair
a
long
time
she
lay
motionless
with
closed
eyes
and
bending
his
head
he
pressed
a
long
kiss
on
the
delicately
chiseled
lips
o
god
spare
me
my
gentle
angel
mary
he
murmured
as
looking
on
the
wan
yet
lovely
face
he
felt
that
to
yield
her
up
was
more
than
he
could
bear
at
this
moment
mrs
carlton
entered
he
held
out
his
hand
and
drawing
her
to
his
side
said
in
a
deep
tender
tone
she
is
mine
now
sister
thank
god
that
at
last
i
have
won
her
and
pray
with
me
that
she
may
be
spared
to
us
both
fervently
she
pressed
his
hand
and
a
bent
down
to
kiss
the
sufferer
gently
he
put
her
back
she
is
wearied
and
just
fallen
asleep
do
not
wake
her
he
carefully
depressed
his
arm
that
she
might
rest
more
easily
mrs
carlton
seated
herself
beside
her
brother
and
whispered
you
will
not
go
to
morrow
frank
no
no
i
will
not
leave
her
a
moment
ellen
does
she
seem
very
much
thinner
since
leaving
home
i
know
she
is
very
pale
yes
frank
she
is
fearfully
changed
within
the
last
week
oh
ellen
if
she
should
be
taken
from
me
and
closer
he
drew
his
arm
as
though
fearing
some
unseen
danger
we
must
look
to
heaven
for
her
restoration
and
god
is
good

his
sister

away
to
conceal
her
tears

the

illustration
widow
cahoon
and
her
grandson
i
wish
to
make
a
call
in
street
said
a
lady
to
me
as
we
together
were
visiting
some
of
the
poor
of
the
city
there
is
nearly
eighty
years
old
she
is
infirm
and
partially
blind
she
has
a
little
grandson
and
she
has
no
means
with
which
to
take
care
of
him
we
hope
to
persuade
her
to
give
him
to
us
and
let
us
find
a
good
home
by
adoption
for
him
it
was
a
warm
winter
s
morning
snow
had
fallen
the
day
before
but
it
was
rapidly
disappearing
the
foot
sank
in
the
melting
mass
at
every
step
the
crossings
were
muddy
and
it
required
some
skill
to
pick
our
way
along
dry
shod
we
turned
into
the
street
and
sought
for
the
number
which
had
been
given
us
we
found
it
on
the
door
of
a
low
shed
like
building
old
and
out
of
repair
does
mrs
smith
live
here
we
inquired
no
ma
am
is
there
an
old
lady
who
is
almost
blind
and
who
has
a
little
grandson
in
the
house
we
further
asked
thinking
mrs
smith
might
there
is
no
such
person
here
does
she
live
in
the
neighbourhood
she
may
be
in
no
we
made
inquiries
at
several
doors
dodging
in
quickly
to
avoid
the
great
drops
which
came
pattering
down
on
the
pavement
from
the
gutterless
eaves
but
we
could
learn
nothing
of
the
object
of
our
search
at
length
we
came
to
a
grocery
and
stepping
in
by
the
mackerel
barrels
which
stood
at
the
door
we
repeated
our
inquiry
can
you
tell
us
where
mrs
smith
lives
she
is
an
old
lady
almost
blind
and
has
a
little
grandson
oh
yes
i
know
her
well
she
is
a
deserving
needy
woman
the
man
followed
us
to
the
street
to
point
out
the
house
where
she
lived
as
he
was
telling
us
a
woman
passed
by
he
spoke
to
her
saying
you
know
where
mrs
smith
lives
the
old
lady
who
is
almost
blind
and
who
has
a
little
grandson
these
ladies
the
place
yes
she
walked
on
with
us
till
she
came
to
a
large
tenement
building
and
then
directed
us
to
a
room
in
the
upper
story
we
thanked
her
and
entered
the
narrow
hall
and
passed
up
the
still
narrower
staircase
we
knocked
at
the
door
and
were
bidden
to
enter
the
old
lady
was
not
there
we
inquired
for
her
again
and
learned
that
she
had
just
gone
out
the
woman
said
she
would
send
for
her
a
boy
ten
or
twelve
years
old
went
to
find
her
while
he
was
gone
we
talked
with
his
mother
a
round
faced
good
natured
intelligent
irish
woman
we
asked
her
where
mrs
smith
lived
and
she
said
she
was
most
of
the
time
with
her
poor
woman
she
had
only
a
living
room
and
a
bed
room
for
herself
and
four
children
yet
she
was
willing
to
share
them
with
another
as
poor
and
more
helpless
than
herself
she
was
a
widow
too
husband
died
last
spring
during
the
summer
she
had
provided
for
her
family
by
washing
and
cleaning
but
this
winter
she
finds
it
almost
impossible
to
get
work
one
of
the
children
is
a
babe
who
was
lying
on
a
rough
unpainted
board
cradle
rudely
put
together
by
some
unaccustomed
hand
this
infant
had
been
taken
care
of
during
the
summer
by
his
brother
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
years
old
while
his
mother
was
absent
at
work
there
was
a
little
girl
about
eight
years
old
who
attends
the
industrial
school
she
was
quite
unwell
and
had
not
been
able
to
go
out
for
several
days
she
sat
in
the
great
rocking
chair
looking
sad
and
disconsolate
as
most
sick
children
do
she
was
comfortably
clothed
her
dress
she
had
received
at
the
school
and
had
sewed
on
it
herself
doing
all
her
little
fingers
could
do
to
make
it
her
hair
was
neatly
combed
she
was
feverish
and
very
thirsty
sometimes
she
went
to
the
pail
herself
would
get
it
for
her
he
seemed
kind
gentle
and
sympathizing
a
good
example
for
some
more
favoured
boys
pretty
soon
the
door
opened
and
an
aged
woman
bent
with
years
and
breathing
hard
and
painfully
entered
the
room
a
boy
with
a
complexion
fair
and
transparent
through
which
the
blue
veins
showed
themselves
immediately
followed
her
she
greeted
us
kindly
and
took
a
chair
by
my
side
bending
towards
us
that
she
might
hear
more
easily
for
she
was
almost
deaf
she
told
us
that
since
her
daughter
s
death
she
had
been
entirely
dependent
on
charity
after
talking
with
her
a
short
time
mrs
b
the
lady
accompanying
me
gave
her
little
grandson
a
penny
to
buy
some
candy
she
did
so
because
she
wished
to
talk
with
his
grandmother
about
him
and
thought
he
had
perhaps
better
not
be
in
the
room
so
soon
as
he
left
she
asked
the
old
lady
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
part
with
previously
in
regard
imps
of
h
l
begone
ye
ghostly
demons
forever
pointing
with
your
long
fingers
what
would
you
have
me
see
his
eyes
were
wild
with
a
horrible
stare
as
if
fixed
by
the
magic
power
of
some
ghastly
sight
while
large
drops
of
perspiration
oozed
from
brow
in
fixed
horror
he
thus
remained
for
some
moments
then
fell
back
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
as
if
to
shut
out
the
dreadful
scene
then
rousing
again
he
exclaimed
in
another
key
no
no
no
not
that
i
ll
not
come
to
that
alive
and
food
for
crawling
worms
no
no
no
then
birds
of
prey
feasting
upon
my
flesh
oh
god
the
curse
the
curse
this
last
vision
seemed
to
overpower
him
and
he
lay
moaning
most
piteously
for
a
length
of
time
then
the
wilder
phases
of
a
distempered
mind
came
on
and
he
again
resumed
his
frenzied
tone
manner
and
language
begone

fought

furiously
for
a
brief
period
then
hour

followed
from
which
he
awoke
much
debilitated
with
his
waning
strength
the
delirium
took
a
milder
form
the

of
the

still
to
be

to

on
this

of

the

continued
to
rave
in
this

crazed
manner
hamilton
and
much
of
the
time
ellen
too
a
witness
of
his
madness
as
morning
drew
near
he
fell
into
a
more
tranquil
slumber
and
the
violence
of
the
fever
seemed
to
have
passed
with
the
early
dawn
seizing
a
favorable
moment
when
all
their
enemies
were
asleep
the
lovers
made
their
escape
ramsey
and
the
indians
were
so
much
occupied
with
durant
they
did
not
think
of
the
prisoners
as
they
would
have
done
under
other
circumstances
though
they
did
not
feel
desirous
of
seeing
the
deeds
of
the
past
day
re
enacted
it
was
some
time
before
they
noticed
the
escape
and
then
no
pursuit
was
instituted
until
after
the
morning
meal
was
dispatched
hamilton
and
ellen
made
the
best
of
their
way
down
the
ohio
and
early
in
the
evening
had
the
good
fortune
to
fall
upon
the
of
ellen
s
brother
who
had
busied
himself
day
and
night
to
raise
the
force
and
go
in
quest
of
the
captives
having
resolved
never
to
cease
his
efforts
until
his
sister
was
rescued
or
her
fate
learned
and
her
death
avenged
the
meeting
was
a
happy
one
and
as
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
accomplished
the
party
returned
home
when
there
was
a
time
of
general
rejoicing
conclusion
we
have
little
more
to
say
as
the
reader
will
conclude
without
reading
the
fact
walter
and
ellen
were
married
according
to
their
original
arrangements
and
afterward
lived
in
the
enjoyment
of
that
happiness
which
love
alone
can
procure
and
which
can
be
found
only
at
the
domestic
fireside
where
peace
reigns
their
descendants
may
still
be
found
in
kentucky
and
other
western
states
durant
recovered
from
his
hurt
and
lived
for
some
years
to
plot
more
mischief
and
fail
in
his
designs
he
at
last
quarreled
with
one
of
his
savage
followers
and
in
a
fit
of
anger
struck
never
forgotten
or
forgiven
the
indian
vowed
to
be
revenged
and
he
kept
his
oath
dogging
the
steps
of
his
foe
he
found
an
opportunity
to
inflict
a
wound
which
felled
his
adversary
to
the
earth
with
proper
attention
he
might
have
recovered
but
his
enemy
left
him
disabled
and
bound
to
die
by
slow
inches
his
wound
at
first
very
painful
soon
began
to
mortify
and
he
felt
the
worms
in
his
still
living
body
vultures
came
to
feast
upon
him
ere
the
vital
spark
of
existence
had
gone
out
within
him
and
he
had
not
the
strength
left
to
lift
a
hand
or
speak
a
word
in
his
own
defense
though
their
long
beaks
were
stretched
over
him
and
planted
in
his
flesh
and
eyes
and
when
death
at
last
came
and
laid
his
icy
fingers
upon
his
heart
for
the
final
stilling
of
its
disquiet
and
guilty
throbbing
his
failing
senses
were
suddenly
and
momentarily
aroused
and
the
curdling
blood
sent
again
with
quickened
impulse
through
the
horrible
sound
of
the
howlings
of
wild
beasts
in
the
distance
and
the
last
things
that
his
closing
almost
sightless
balls
beheld
were
the
glaring
eyes
of
the
monsters
of
the
forest
as
they
gloated
over
their
prey
the
sight
was
enough
to
finish
the
work
of
dissolution
already
advanced
near
to
completion
and
the
sluggish
blood
rushed
for
the
last
time
upon
his
paralyzed
heart
with
such
chilling
coldness
and
mastering
power
that
it
ceased
to
beat
and
the
wretch
was
dead
then
a
fight
took
place
over
his
putrefying
carcass
and
the
screech
of
the
vulture
mingled
with
the
angry
growl
of
the
wolf
as
they
contended
for
the
remains
of
the
man
of
crimes
in
their
wild
fury
and
ferocious
hunger
a
few
hours
longer
and
the
flesh
was
train
of
reflection
that
made
my
limbs
again
tremble
and
my
heart
beat
heavily
once
more
it
was
not
a
new
terror
that
thus
affected
me
but
the
dawn
of
a
more
exciting
hope
this
hope
arose
partly
from
memory
and
partly
from
present
observation
i
called
to
mind
the
great
variety
of
buoyant
matter
that
strewed
the
coast
of
lofoden
having
been
absorbed
and
then
thrown
forth
by
the
moskoe
stroem
by
the
most
extraordinary
way
so
chafed
and
roughened
as
to
have
the
appearance
of
being
stuck
full
of
splinters
but
then
i
distinctly
recollected
that
there
were
some
of
them
which
were
not
disfigured
at
all
now
i
could
not
account
for
this
difference
except
by
supposing
that
the
roughened
fragments
were
the
only
ones
which
had
been
completely
absorbed
that
the
others
had
entered
the
whirl
at
so
late
a
period
of
the
tide
or
for
some
reason
had
descended
so
slowly
after
entering
that
they
did
not
reach
the
bottom
before
the
turn
of
the
flood
came
or
of
the
ebb
as
the
case
might
be
i
conceived
it
possible
in
either
instance
that
they
might
thus
be
whirled
up
again
to
the
level
of
the
ocean
without
undergoing
the
fate
of
those
which
had
been
drawn
in
more
early
or
absorbed
more
rapidly
i
made
also
three
important
observations
the
first
was
that
as
a
general
rule
the
larger
the
bodies
were
the
more
rapid
masses
of
equal
extent
the
one
spherical
and
the
other
of
any
other
shape
the
superiority
in
speed
of
descent
was
with
the
sphere
the
third
that
between
two
masses
of
equal
size
the
one
cylindrical
and
the
other
of
any
other
shape
the
cylinder
was
absorbed
the
more
slowly
since
my
escape
i
have
had
several
conversations
on
this
subject
with
an
old
school
master
of
the
district
and
it
was
from
him
that
i
learned
the
use
of
the
words
cylinder
and
sphere
he
explained
to
me
although
i
have
forgotten
the
explanation
how
what
i
observed
was
in
fact
the
natural
consequence
of
the
forms
of
the
floating
fragments
and
showed
me
how
it
happened
that
a
cylinder
swimming
in
a
vortex
offered
more
resistance
to
its
suction
and
was
drawn
in
with
greater
difficulty
than
an
equally
bulky
body
of
any
form
whatever
there
was
one
startling
circumstance
which
went
a
great
way
in
enforcing
these
observations
and
this
was
that
at
every
revolution
we
passed
something
like
a
barrel
or
else
the
yard
or
the
mast
of
a
vessel
while
many
of
these
things
which
had
been
on
our
level
when
i
first
opened
my
eyes
upon
the
wonders
of
the
whirlpool
were
now
high
up
above
us
and
seemed
to
have
moved
but
little
from
their
original
station
i
no
longer
hesitated
what
to
do
i
resolved
to
lash
myself
securely
to
the
water
cask
upon
which
i
now
held
to
cut
it
loose
from
the
counter
and
to
throw
myself
with
it
into
the
water
i
attracted
my
brother
s
attention
by
signs
pointed
to
the
floating
barrels
that
came
near
us
and
did
everything
in
my
power
to
make
him
understand
what
i
was
about
to
do
i
thought
at
length
that
he
comprehended
my
design
but
whether
this
was
the
case
or
not
he
shook
his
head
despairingly
and
refused
to
move
from
his
station
by
the
ring
bolt
it
was
impossible
and
so
with
a
bitter
struggle
i
resigned
him
to
his
fate
fastened
myself
to
the
cask
by
means
of
the
lashings
which
secured
it
to
the
counter
and
precipitated
myself
with
it
into
the
sea
without
another
moment
s
hesitation
the
result
was
precisely
what
i
had
hoped
it
might
be
as
it
is
myself
who
now
tell
you
this
tale
as
you
see
that
i
did
escape
and
as
you
are
already
in
possession
of
the
mode
in
which
this
escape
was
effected
and
must
therefore
anticipate
all
that
i
have
farther
to
say
i
will
bring
my
story
quickly
to
conclusion
it
might
have
been
an
hour
or
thereabout
after
my
quitting
the
smack
when
having
descended
to
a
vast
distance
beneath
me
it
made
three
or
four
wild
gyrations
in
rapid
succession
and
bearing
my
loved
brother
with
it
plunged
headlong
at
once
and
forever
into
the
chaos
of
foam
below
the
barrel
to
which
i
was
attached
sunk
very
little
farther
and
the
spot
at
which
i
leaped
overboard
before
a
great
change
took
place
in
the
character
of
the
whirlpool
the
slope
of
the
sides
of
the
vast
funnel
became
momently
less
and
less
steep
the
gyrations
of
the
whirl
grew
gradually
less
and
less
violent
by
degrees
the
froth
and
the
rainbow
disappeared
and
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
seemed
slowly
to
uprise
the
sky
was
clear
the
winds
had
gone
down
and
the
full
moon
was
setting
radiantly
in
the
west
when
i
found
myself
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
in
full
view
of
the
shores
of
lofoden
and
above
the
spot
where
the
pool
of
the
moskoe
stroem
had
been
it
was
the
hour
of
the
slack
but
the
sea
still
heaved
in
mountainous
waves
from
the
effects
of
the
hurricane
i
was
borne
violently
into
the
channel
of
the
stroem
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
hurried
down
the
coast
into
the
grounds
of
the
fishermen
a
boat
picked
me
up
exhausted
from
fatigue
from
the
memory
of
its
horror
those
who
drew
me
on
board
were
my
old
mates
and
daily
companions
but
they
knew
me
no
more
than
they
would
have
known
a
traveller
from
the
spirit
land
my
hair
which
had
been
raven
black
the
day
before
was
as
white
as
you
see
it
now
they
say
too
that
the
whole
expression
of
my
countenance
had
changed
i
told
them
my
story
they
did
not
believe
it
i
now
tell
it
to
you
and
i
can
scarcely
expect
you
to
put
more
faith
in
spectre
which
sate
at
all
feasts
how
often
monos
did
we
lose
ourselves
in
speculations
upon
its
nature
how
mysteriously
did
it
act
as
a
check
to
human
bliss
saying
unto
it
thus
far
and
no
farther
that
earnest
mutual
love
my
own
monos
which
burned
within
our
bosoms
how
vainly
did
we
flatter
ourselves
feeling
happy
in
its
first
up
springing
that
our
happiness
would
strengthen
with
its
strength
alas
as
it
grew
so
grew
in
our
hearts
the
dread
of
that
evil
hour
which
was
hurrying
to
separate
us
forever
love
hate
would
have
been
mercy
then
monos
speak
not
here
of
these
griefs
dear
una
mine
mine
forever
now
una
but
the
memory
of
past
sorrow
is
it
not
present
joy
i
have
much
to
say
yet
of
the
things
which
have
been
above
all
i
burn
to
know
the
incidents
of
your
own
passage
through
the
dark
valley
and
shadow
monos
and
when
did
the
radiant
una
ask
anything
of
her
monos
in
vain
i
will
be
minute
in
relating
all
but
at
what
point
shall
the
weird
narrative
begin
una
at
what
point
monos
you
have
said
una
monos
i
comprehend
you
in
death
we
have
both
learned
the
propensity
of
man
to
define
the
indefinable
i
will
not
say
then
commence
with
the
moment
of
life
s
cessation
but
commence
with
that
sad
sad
instant
when
the
fever
having
abandoned
you
you
sank
into
a
breathless
and
motionless
torpor
and
i
pressed
down
your
one
word
first
my
una
in
regard
to
man
s
general
condition
at
this
epoch
you
will
remember
that
one
or
two
of
the
wise
among
our
forefathers
wise
in
fact
although
not
in
the
world
s
esteem
had
ventured
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
the
term
improvement
as
applied
to
the
progress
of
our
civilization
there
were
periods
in
each
of
the
five
or
six
centuries
immediately
preceding
our
dissolution
when
arose
some
vigorous
intellect
boldly
contending
for
those
principles
whose
truth
appears
now
to
our
disenfranchised
reason
so
utterly
obvious
principles
which
should
have
taught
our
race
to
submit
to
the
guidance
of
the
natural
laws
rather
than
attempt
their
control
at
long
intervals
some
masterminds
appeared
looking
upon
each
advance
in
practical
science
as
a
retro
gradation
in
the
true
utility
occasionally
the
poetic
intellect
that
intellect
which
we
now
feel
to
have
been
the
most
exalted
of
all
since
those
truths
which
to
us
were
of
the
most
enduring
importance
could
only
be
reached
by
that
and
to
the
unaided
reason
bears
no
weight
occasionally
did
this
poetic
intellect
proceed
a
step
farther
in
the
evolving
of
the
vague
idea
of
the
philosophic
and
find
in
the
mystic
parable
that
tells
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
of
its
forbidden
fruit
death
producing
a
distinct
intimation
that
knowledge
was
not
meet
for
man
in
the
infant
condition
of
his
soul
and
these
men
the
poets
living
and
perishing
amid
the
scorn
of
the
utilitarians
of
rough
pedants
who
arrogated
to
themselves
a
title
which
could
have
been
properly
applied
only
to
the
scorned
these
men
the
poets
pondered
piningly
yet
not
unwisely
upon
the
ancient
days
when
our
wants
were
not
more
simple
than
our
enjoyments
were
keen
days
when
mirth
was
a
word
unknown
so
solemnly
deep
toned
was
happiness
holy
august
and
blissful
days
when
blue
rivers
ran
undammed
between
hills
unhewn
into
far
forest
solitudes
primaeval
odorous
and
unexplored
yet
these
noble
exceptions
from
the
general
misrule
served
had
fallen
upon
the
most
evil
of
all
our
evil
days
the
great
movement
that
was
the
cant
term
went
on
a
diseased
commotion
moral
and
physical
art
the
arts
arose
supreme
and
once
enthroned
cast
chains
upon
the
intellect
which
had
elevated
them
to
power
man
because
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
the
majesty
of
nature
fell
into
childish
exultation
at
his
acquired
and
still
increasing
dominion
over
her
elements
even
while
he
stalked
a
god
in
his
own
fancy
an
infantine
imbecility
came
over
him
as
might
be
supposed
from
the
origin
of
his
disorder
he
grew
infected
with
system
and
with
abstraction
he
enwrapped
himself
in
generalities
among
other
odd
ideas
that
of
universal
equality
gained
ground
and
in
the
face
of
analogy
and
of
god
in
despite
of
the
loud
warning
voice
of
the
laws
of
gradation
so
visibly
pervading
all
things
in
earth
an
heaven
wild
attempts
at
an
omni
prevalent
democracy
were
made
yet
this
evil
sprang
necessarily
from
know
and
succumb
meantime
huge
smoking
cities
arose
innumerable
green
leaves
shrank
before
the
hot
breath
of
furnaces
the
fair
face
of
nature
was
deformed
as
with
the
ravages
of
some
loathsome
disease
and
methinks
sweet
una
even
our
slumbering
sense
of
the
forced
and
of
the
far
fetched
might
have
arrested
us
here
but
now
it
appears
that
we
had
worked
out
our
own
destruction
in
the
perversion
of
our
taste
or
rather
in
the
blind
neglect
of
its
culture
in
the
schools
for
in
truth
it
was
at
this
crisis
that
taste
alone
that
faculty
which
holding
a

down

had

some
one
to
care
for

and

man
came
out

and
took

in
and
gave
me
something
to
eat
his
name
was
mike
mullholland
and
he
was
good
to
me
and
i
liked
him
and
took
his
name
and
he
lived
with
a
repulsive
looking
woman
in
a
little
room
he
paid
ten
dollars
a
month
for
he
had
two
big
dogs
and
worked
at
day
work
in
a
slaughter
house
in
staunton
mullholland
s
dogs
and
with
them
i
used
to
sleep
on
the
rags
of
carpet
spread
for
us
in
the
room
with
mullholland
and
his
wife
who
i
got
to
calling
mother
this
is
how
i
took
the
name
of
mullholland
i
was
glad
to
leave
the
points
and
felt
as
if
i
had
a
home
but
there
was
a
bottomless
pit
in
sheriff
street
and
though
not
so
bad
as
the
one
at
the
house
of
the
nine
nations
it
gave
out
a
deal
of
gin
that
the
mullhollands
had
a
liking
for
i
was
continually
going
for
it
and
the
mullhollands
were
continually
drinking
it
and
the
whole
neighborhood
liked
it
and
in
nightmare
s
alley
the
undertaker
found
a
profitable
business
in
the
morning
i
went
with
the
dogs
to
the
slaughter
house
and
there
fed
them
and
took
care
of
the
fighting
cocks
and
brought
gin
for
the
men
who
worked
there
in
the
afternoon
i
joined
the
newsboys
as
ragged
and
neglected
policemen
whom
we
called
the
charleys
i
lived
with
mullholland
two
years
and
saw
and
felt
enough
to
make
hardened
any
one
of
my
age
one
morning
there
came
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
which
was
followed
by
the
entrance
of
two
officers
the
dogs
had
got
out
and
bitten
a
child
and
the
officers
knowing
who
owned
them
had
come
to
arrest
mullholland
we
were
all
surprised
for
the
officers
recognized
in
mullholland
and
the
woman
two
old
offenders
and
while
they
were
dragged
off
to
the
tombs
i
was
left
to
prey
upon
the
world
as
best
i
could
again
homeless
i
wandered
about
with
urchins
as
ragged
and
destitute
as
myself
it
seemed
to
me
that
everybody
viewed
me
as
an
object
of
suspicion
for
i
sought
in
vain
for
employment
that
would
give
me
bread
and
clothing
i
wanted
to
be
honest
and
would
have
lived
honest
but
i
could
not
make
people
believe
me
honest
and
when
i
told
who
i
was
and
everybody
judged
me
by
the
filthy
shreds
on
my
back
nobody
had
anything
for
me
to
do
i
applied
at
a
grocer
s
to
sweep
his
store
and
go
errands
when
i
told
him
where
i
had
lived
he
shook
his
head
and
ordered
me
away
knowing
i
could
fill
a
place
not
unknown
to
me
i
applied
at
a
butcher
s
in
mott
street
but
he
pointed
his
knife
which
left
a
wound
in
my
feelings
and
ordered
me
away
and
i
was
ordered
away
wherever
i
went
the
doors
of
the
chatham
theatre
looked
too
fine
for
me
my
ragged
condition
rebuked
me
wherever
i
went
and
for
more
than
a
week
i
slept
under
a
cart
that
stood
in
mott
street
then
tom
farley
found
me
and
took
me
with
him
to
his
cellar
in
elizabeth
street
where
we
had
what
i
thought
a
good
bed
of
shavings
tom
sold
heralds
gambled
for
cents
and
shared
with
me
and
we
got
along
then
tom
stole
a
dog
which
ended
with
getting
us
both
into
the
tombs
where
tom
was
locked
up
i
was
again
adrift
as
we
used
to
call
it
and
thought
of
poor
tom
a
deal
every
one
i
met
seemed
higher
up
in
the
world
than
i
was
but
i
got
into
centre
market
carried
baskets
and
did
what
i
could
to
earn
a
shilling
and
slept
in
tom
s
bed
where
there
was
some
nights
fifteen
and
twenty
like
myself
one
morning
while
waiting
a
job
my
feet
and
hands
benumbed
with
the
cold
a
beautiful
lady
slipped
a
shilling
into
my
hand
and
passed
on
to
one
penniless
and
hungry
it
seemed
a
deal
of
money
necessity
had
almost
driven
me
to
the
sign
of
the
three

to
see
what
the
man
of
the
eagle
face
would
give
me
on
my
cap

as
i
had
i
followed
the

for
there
not

it

next
drove

there
it

will

we
find
the

in

reeking
with

hurling

into
the
dark

of
the

poor
and
making

in

thanks

enhance

will
pass

grasping
bobby

hand
even
timmins
glanced
with
something
like
admiration
in
his
looks
at
the
youth
whom
he
had
so
lately
despised
perhaps
too
he
thought
of
that
scripture
wisdom
about
entertaining
angels
unawares
he
was
very
much
abashed
and
nothing
but
his
silly
pride
prevented
him
from
acknowledging
his
error
and
begging
bobby
s
forgiveness
i
ca
nt
have
a
liar
about
me
said
mr
bayard
there
may
be
some
mistake
suggested
mr
butler
i
brave
and
noble
a
boy
is
incapable
of
a
falsehood
besides
i
got
a
letter
from
my
friend
squire
lee
by
this
morning
s
mail
in
which
he
informed
me
of
my
young
friend
s
coming
mr
bayard
took
from
his
pocket
a
bundle
of
letters
and
selected
the
squire
s
from
among
them
opening
it
he
read
a
passage
which
had
a
direct
bearing
upon
the
case
before
him
i
do
not
know
what
bobby
s
faults
are
the
letter
said
but
this
i
do
know
that
bobby
would
rather
be
whipped
than
tell
a
lie
he
is
noted
through
the
place
for
his
love
of
truth
that
is
pretty
strong
testimony
and
you
see
bobby
that
s
what
the
squire
calls
you
your
reputation
has
preceded
you
bobby
blushed
as
he
always
did
when
he
was
praised
and
mr
timmins
was
more
abashed
than
ever
did
you
hear
that
timmins
who
is
the
liar
now
forgive
me
sir
this
time
if
you
turn
me
off
now
i
can
not
get
another
place
and
my
mother
depends
upon
my
wages
you
ought
to
have
thought
of
this
before
he
aggravated
me
sir
so
that
i
wanted
to
pay
him
off
as
to
that
he
commenced
upon
me
the
moment
i
came
into
the
store
but
do
nt
turn
him
off
if
you
please
sir
said
bobby
who
even
now
wished
no
harm
to
his
discomfited
assailant
he
will
do
better
hereafter
wo
nt
you
timmins
thus
appealed
to
timmins
though
he
did
not
relish
so
direct
an
inquiry
and
from
such
a
source
was
compelled
to
reply
in
the
affirmative
and
mr
bayard
graciously
remitted
the
sentence
he
had
passed
against
the
offending
clerk
now
robert
you
will
come
over
to
my
house
and
dine
with
me
ellen
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
bashfully
i
have
been
to
dinner
referring
to
the
luncheon
he
had
eaten
at
brighton
but
you
must
go
to
the
house
with
me
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
so
sir
but
i
came
on
business
i
will
stay
here
with
mr
timmins
till
you
come
back
the
truth
is
he
had
heard
something
about
the
fine
houses
of
the
city
and
how
stylish
the
people
were
and
he
had
some
misgivings
about
venturing
into
such
a
strange
and
untried
scene
as
the
parlor
of
a
boston
merchant
indeed
you
must
come
with
me
ellen
would
never
forgive
you
or
me
if
you
do
not
come
i
would
rather
rest
here
till
you
return
replied
bobby
still
willing
to
escape
the
fine
house
and
the
fine
folks
i
walked
from
riverdale
sir
and
i
am
rather
tired
walked
exclaimed
mr
bayard
had
you
no
money
yes
franklin
says
that
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
earned
and
i
thought
i
would
try
it
i
shall
get
rested
by
the
time
you
return
but
you
must
go
with
me
timmins
go
and
get
a
carriage
timmins
obeyed
and
before
mr
bayard
had
finished
asking
bobby
how
all
the
people
in
riverdale
were
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
there
was
no
backing
out
now
and
our
hero
was
obliged
to
get
into
the
vehicle
though
it
seemed
altogether
too
fine
for
a
poor
boy
like
him
mr
bayard
and
mr
butler
whom
the
former
had
invited
to
dine
with
him
seated
themselves
beside
him
and
the
driver
was
directed
to
set
them
down
at
no
chestnut
street
where
they
soon
arrived
though
my
readers
would
no
doubt
be
very
much
amused
to
learn
how
carefully
bobby
trod
the
velvet
carpets
how
he
stared
with
wonder
at
the
drapery
curtains
at
the
tall
mirrors
the
elegant
chandeliers
and
the
fantastically
the
length
of
our
story
does
not
permit
us
to
pause
over
these
trivial
matters
when
ellen
bayard
was
informed
that
her
little
deliverer
was
in
the
house
she
rushed
into
the
parlor
like
a
hoiden
school
girl
grasped
both
his
hands
kissed
both
his
rosy
cheeks
and
behaved
just
as
though
she
had
never
been
to
a
boarding
school
in
her
life
she
had
thought
a
great
deal
about
bobby
since
that
eventful
day
and
the
more
she
thought
of
him
the
more
she
liked
him
her
admiration
of
him
was
not
of
that
silly
sentimental
character
which
moon
struck
young
ladies
cherish
towards
those
immaculate
young
men
who
have
saved
them
from
drowning
in
a
horse
pond
pulled
them
back
just
as
they
were
tumbling
over
a
precipice
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
high
or
rescued
them
from
a
house
seven
stories
high
bearing
them
down
a
ladder
seventy
five
odd
feet
long
the
fact
was
bobby
was
a
boy
of
thirteen
and
there
was
no
chance
for
much
sentiment
so
the
young
lady
ellen
said
a
great
many
very
handsome
things
but
i
am
sure
she
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
that
he
would
run
away
with
her
in
case
her
papa
was
unneccessarily
obstinate
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
wished
bobby
might
be
her
brother
it
would
be
so
glorious
to
have
such
a
noble
little
fellow
always
with
her
bobby
managed
the
dinner
much
better
than
he
had
anticipated
for
mr
bayard
insisted
that
he
should
sit
down
with
them
whether
he
ate
any
thing
or
not
but
the
rubicon
passed
our
hero
found
that
he
had
a
pretty
smart
appetite
and
did
full
justice
to
the
viands
set
had
been
in
there
to
purchase
wood
yesterday
well
sir
i
hardly
know
how
to
reply
to
your
question
but
i
believe
there
were
several
young
ladies
in
here
looking
highly
amused
but
there
was
one
who
came
with
old
copeland
she
had
on
a
purple
merino
dress
and
something
i
do
nt
know
what
else
she
had
on
said
mr
stillinghast
feeling
ridiculous
was
she
very
small
sir
with
bright
hazel
eyes
i
know
nothing
about
the
color
of
her
eyes
but
she
s
something
higher
than
my
walking
stick
replied
the
irascible
old
man
the
same
sir
she
came
with
mr
copeland
and
if
her
eyes
did
nt
make
me
dance
in
and
out
it
s
a
wonder
observed
the
clerk
well
what
in
the
deuce
did
she
want
here
she
bought
a
quarter
of
a
cord
of
oak
wood
and
paid
for
it
what
did
she
want
with
oak
wood
cried
mr
stillinghast
becoming
more
impatient
every
moment
to
burn
i
presume
replied
the
young
man
paring
off
a
chew
of
tobacco
ask
her
we
always
take
it
for
granted
that
people
buy
wood
to
burn
who
does
know
any
thing
about
it
was
the
sharp
response
the
sawyer
i
fancy
if
he
can
be
found
i
have
not
seen
him
about
to
day
however
said
the
young
man
with
a
broad
grin
which
he
speedily
changed
when
his
strange
visitor
burst
out
with
when
he
comes
send
him
to
me
my
name
is
stillinghast
certainly
mr
stillinghast
certainly
excuse
me
sir
for
not
recognizing
you
stammered
the
clerk
i
m
determined
muttered
the
old
man
going
out
and
slamming
to
the
door
without
noticing
the
young
man
s
apologies
i
m
determined
to
sift
this
matter
if
i
had
a
feeling
of
humanity
left
it
was
for
that
girl
papist
though
she
be
if
i
loved
or
cared
a
tithe
for
any
living
being
it
was
she
i
intended
but
never
mind
i
ll
find
it
out
she
has
tried
to
deceive
me
but
i
ll
convince
her
that
she
has
mistaken
her
dupe
where
did
she
get
the
money
to
buy
wood
with
and
at
that
thought
such
a
fierce
sudden
suspicion
tore
through
that
old
half
ossified
heart
that
he
paused
on
the
flags
and
gasped
for
breath
my
god
he
murmured
has
she
robbed
me
and
during
the
remainder
of
that
miserable
day
his
ledgers
were
almost
neglected
foul
and
ungenerous
suspicion
held
possession
of
his
mind
and
inflamed
with
a
malicious
anger
he
plotted
and
schemed
his
revenge
until
he
had
defined
a
plan
that
well
suited
his
present
mood
if
she
plots
he
muttered
rubbing
his
dry
yellow
hands
together
with
grim
delight
i
will
counter
plot
it
is
not
the
wrong
but
the
person
who
inflicts
it
that
stings
me
but
the
serpent
s
tooth
has
been
gnawing
these
many
years
at
my
and
he
had
obtained
no
clue
to
the
mystery
which
increased
his
anxiety
and
made
him
more
fretful
and
testy
than
usual
he
allowed
no
opportunity
to
escape
to
make
may
feel
his
displeasure
bitter
and
contemptuous
speeches
coarse
allusions
to
her
religion
fault
finding
with
all
she
did
and
sudden
outbursts
of
unprovoked
fury
were
now
the
daily
trials
of
her
life
trials
which
were
sore
temptations
and
full
of
humiliation
to
a
proud
high
spirit
like
may
s
and
sharp
were
the
struggles
and
earnest
the
prayers
and
many
the
scalding
tears
she
shed
ere
she
subdued
the
storm
of
wild
and
indignant
resentment
which
swept
like
whirlwinds
through
her
soul
but
her
talisman
the
cross
of
jesus
christ
was
her
safeguard
its
splinters
inflicted
many
a
sharp
wound
but
none
so
sharp
that
the
balm
it
distilled
could
not
heal
and
beautify
them
helen
in
a
fright
kept
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
towards
her
mr
stillinghast
s
manner
was
inconsistent
kind
at
another
captious
and
surly
sometimes
he
called
on
her
for
every
thing
and
perhaps
the
next
moment
threatened
to
throw
whatever
he
had
ordered
at
her
head
once
he
told
her
in
bitter
tones
and
language
that
but
for
wishing
to
make
use
of
her
to
effect
certain
ends
he
would
turn
her
into
the
street
he
had
a
new
lock
and
key
of
a
peculiar
construction
fitted
on
his
chamber
door
which
he
locked
every
morning
carefully
and
carried
the
key
away
with
him
this
is
awful
may
how
can
you
bear
it
as
you
do
for
you
do
not
seem
the
least
afraid
of
him
said
helen
one
morning
i
am
afraid
of
offending
our
lord
by
spitefulness
and
returning
injuries
to
one
who
is
my
benefactor
replied
may
you
do
feel
spiteful
then
sometimes
really
it
is
quite
refreshing
to
know
that
you
are
not
perfect
said
helen
very
often
i
am
full
of
imperfections
i
am
not
patient
or
humble
or
even
forgiving
i
am
only
outwardly
outwardly
calm
and
silent
because
i
do
not
think
it
right
to
fan
up
resentments
and
malice
and
bitterness
all
so
antagonistic
to
the
love
of
god
i
hope
oh
i
hope
my
motive
is
singly
and
purely
to
avoid
offending
him
said
may
humbly
and
earnestly
i
heartily
wish
the
old
wretch
would
die
exclaimed
helen
oh
helen
so
unprovided
as
he
is
for
another
world
unsay
that
wo
nt
you
cried
may
clasping
her
hands
together
no
may
i
mean
it
i
think
he
is
as
much
fit
to
die
now
as
he
ever
will
be
he
has
doubtless
spent
his
life
in
tormenting
others
and
it
will
only
be
fair
when
he
is
tormented
in
his
turn
but
spare
those
looks
of
horror
and
tell
me

my
home
the
little
cottage
in
the
woods
was
one
mile
distant
there
was
a
by
path
a
foot
path
as
it
was
called
which
cut
the
woods
in
a
diagonal
line
and
which
had
been
trodden
hard
and
smooth
by
the
feet
of
the
children
even
at
mid
day
there
was
twilight
in
that
solitary
path
and
when
the
shadows
deepened
and
lengthened
the
moment
i
turned
into
that
path
i
was
supreme
it
was
mine
the
public
road
the
thoroughfare
leading
through
the
heart
of
the
town
belonged
to

i
was

to
walk
there

mincing
steps
and
bonnet
tied
primly
under
the
chin
according
to
the

in

i
could
do
just
as
i
pleased
i
could
run
with
my
bonnet
swinging
in
my
hand
and
my
hair
floating
like
the
wild
vine
of
the
woods
i
could
throw
myself
down
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
great
trees
and
looking
up
into
the
deep
distant
sky
indulge
my

wondrous

i
did
so
now
i
cast
myself
panting
on
the

and
turning
my
face
downward
instead
of
upward
clasped
my
hands
over
it
and
the
hot
tears
gushed
in
scalding
streams
through
my
fingers
till
the
pillow
of
earth
was
all
wet
as
with

was
comfort
there
was

up
gabriella
you
must
not
lie
here
on

damp
ground
get
up
it
is
almost
night
what
will
your
mother
say
what
will
she
think
has
become
of
you
i
started
up
bewildered
and
alarmed
passing
my
hands
dreamily
over
my
swollen
eyelids
heavy
shadows
hung
over
the
woods
night
was
indeed
approaching
i
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
and
knew
it
not
it
was
richard
clyde
who
awakened
me
his
schoolmaster
called
him
dick
but
i
to
me
a
boy
of
fifteen
the
hardest
student
in
the
academy
and
next
to
my
mother
and
peggy
the
best
friend
i
had
in
the
world
i
had
no
brother
and
many
a
time
had
he
acted
a
brother
s
part
when
i
had
needed
a
manly
champion
yet
my
mother
had
enjoined
on
me
such
strict
reserve
in
my
intercourse
with
the
boy
pupils
and
my
disposition
was
so
shy
our
acquaintance
had
never
approached
familiarity
i
did
not
mean
to
shake
you
so
hard
said
he
stepping
back
a
few
paces
as
he
spoke
but
i
never
knew
any
one
sleep
so
like
a
log
before
i
feared
for
a
moment
that
you
were
dead
it
would
not
be
much
matter
if
i
were
i
answered
hardly
knowing
what
i
said
for
a
dull
weight
pressed
on
my
brain
and
despondency
had
succeeded
excitement
oh
gabriella
is
it
not
wicked
to
say
that
if
you
would
feel
like
saying
it
too
yes
he
exclaimed
energetically
you
have
been
treated
badly
shamefully
and
i
told
the
master
so
to
his
face
you
you
did
not
richard
you
only
thought
so
you
would
not
have
told
him
so
for
all
the
world
but
i
did
though
as
soon
as
you
ran
out
of
school
it
seemed
as
if
he
made
but
one
step
to
the
door
and
his
face
looked
as
black
as
night
i
thought
if
he
overtook
you
he
might
i
did
not
know
what
he
would
do
he
was
so
angry
i
sat
near
the
door
and
i
jumped
right
up
and
faced
him
on
the
threshold
do
nt
sir
do
nt
i
cried
she
is
a
little
girl
and
you
a
great
strong
man
what
is
that
to
you
sirrah
he
exclaimed
and
the
forked
lightning
ran
out
yet
gabriella
it
is
a
great
deal
sir
i
answered
as
bold
as
a
lion
you
have
treated
her
cruelly
enough
already
it
would
be
cowardly
to
pursue
her
oh
richard
how
dared
you
say
that
did
he
not
strike
you
he
lifted
his
hand
but
instead
of
flinching
i
made
myself
as
tall
as
i
could
and
looked
at
him
right
steadfastly
you
do
not
know
how
pale
he
looked
when
i
stopped
him
on
the
threshold
his
very
lips
turned
white
i
declare
there
is
something
grand
in
a
great
passion
it
makes
one
look
somehow
so
different
from
common
folks
well
now
as
soon
as
he
raised
his
hand
to
strike
me
a
red
flush
shot
into
his
face
like
the
blaze
of
an
inward
fire
it
was
shame
anger
made
him
white
but
shame
turned
him
as
red
as
blood
his
arm
dropped
down
to
his
side
then
he
laid
his
hand
said
he
i
must
talk
with
you
and
did
you
i
asked
hanging
with
breathless
interest
on
his
words
yes
i
have
just
left
him
he
has
not
expelled
you
richard
no
but
he
says
i
must
ask
his
pardon
before
the
whole
school
to
morrow
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
i
will
never
do
it
i
am
so
sorry
this
has
happened
said
i
oh
that
i
had
never
written
that
foolish
foolish
poetry
it
has
done
so
much
mischief
you
are
not
to
blame
gabriella
he
had
no
business
to
laugh
at
it
it
was
beautiful
all
the
boys
say
so
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
a
great
poetess
one
of
these
days
he
ought
to
have
been
proud
of
it
instead
of
making
fun
of
you
it
of
her
time
in
fasting
and
singing
her
plaintive
songs
there
she
pined
away
taking
little
nourishment
and
constantly
desiring
to
pass
away
to
that
land
of
expected
bliss
and
freedom
from
care
where
it
is
believed
that
the
spirits
of
men
will
be
again
reunited
and
tread
over
fields
of
flowery
enjoyment
and
when
death
came
to
her
it
was
not
as
the
bearer
of
gloom
and
regrets
but
as
the
herald
of
happiness
after
her
decease
the
mysterious
bird
was
never
more
seen
and
it
became
a
popular
opinion
that
the
mysterious
visitor
had
flown

her

a

stood
on

banks
of
a

lake
it
was
near
the
hour
of
sunset
silence
reigned
within
and
without
not
a
sound
was
heard
but
the
low
breathing
of
the
dying
inmate
and
head
of
this
poor
family
his
wife
and
three
children
surrounded
his

two
of

grown
up
the
other
was
a

child
all
their
simple
skill
in
medicine
had
been
exhausted
to
no
effect
they
moved
about
the
lodge
in
whispers
and
were
waiting
the
departure
of
the
spirit
as

acts

kindness

man
felt
a
momentary
return
of
strength
and
raising
himself
a
little
addressed
his
family
i
leave
you
in
a
world
of
care
in
which
it
has
required
all
my
strength
and
skill
to
supply
you
food
and
protect
you
from
the
storms
and
cold
of
life
i
have
less
sorrow
in
parting
because
i
am
persuaded
you
will
not
remain
long
behind
me
and
will
therefore
find
the
period
of
your
sufferings
shortened
but
you
my
children
my
poor
and
forsaken
children
who
have
just
commenced
the
career
of
life
who
will
protect
you
from
its
evils
listen
to
my
words
unkindness
ingratitude
and
every
wickedness
is
in
the
scene
before
you
it
is
for
this
cause
that
years
ago
i
withdrew
from
my
kindred
and
my
tribe
to
spend
my
days
in
this
lonely
spot
i
have
contented
myself
with
the
company
of
your
mother
and
yourselves
during
seasons
of
very
frequent
scarcity
and
want
while
your
kindred
feasting
in
a
scene
where
food
is
plenty
have
caused
the
forests
to
echo
with
the
shouts
of
successful
war
i
gave
up
these
things
for
the
enjoyment
of
peace
i
wished
to
shield
you
from
the
bad
examples
you
would
inevitably
have
followed
i
have
seen
you
thus
far
grow
up
we
have
escaped
pain
of
mind
we
have
been
kept
from
scenes
of
rioting
and
bloodshed
my
career
is
now
at
its
close
i
will
shut
my
eyes
in
peace
if
you
my
children
will
promise
me
to
cherish
each
other
let
not
your
mother
suffer
during
the
few
days
that
are
left
to
her
and
i
charge
you
on
no
account
to
forsake
your
youngest
brother
of
him
i
give
you
both
my
dying
charge
to
take
a
tender
care
he
sank
exhausted
on
his
pallet
the
family
waited
a
moment
as
if
expecting
to
hear
something
further
but
when
they
came
to
his
side
the
spirit
had
taken
its
flight
the
mother
and
daughter
gave
vent
to
their
feelings
in
lamentations
the
elder
son
witnessed
the
scene
in
silence
he
soon
exerted
himself
to
supply
with
the
bow
and
net
his
father
s
place
time
however
wore
away
heavily
five
moons
had
filled
and
waned
and
the
sixth
was
in
her
last
moments
she
pressed
the
fulfilment
of
their
promise
to
their
father
which
the
children
readily
renewed
because
they
were
yet
free
from
selfish
motives
the
winter
passed
and
the
spring
with
its
enlivening
effects
in
a
northern
hemisphere
cheered
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
bereft
little
family
the
girl
being
the
eldest
dictated
to
her
brothers
and
seemed
to
feel
a
tender
and
sisterly
affection
for
the
youngest
who
was
rather
sickly
and
delicate
the
other
boy
soon
showed
symptoms
of
restlessness
and
ambition
and
addressed
the
sister
as
follows
my
sister
are
we
always
to
live
as
if
there
were
no
other
human
beings
in
the
world
must
i
deprive
myself
of
the
pleasure
of
associating
with
my
own
kind
i
have
determined
this
question
for
myself
i
shall
seek
the
villages
of
men
and
you
can
not
prevent
me
the
sister
replied
i
do
not
say
no
my
brother
to
what
you
desire
we
are
not
prohibited
the
society
each
other
and
to
do
nothing
independent
of
each
other
neither
pleasure
nor
pain
ought
therefore
to
separate
us
especially
from
our
younger
brother
who
being
but
a
child
and
weakly
withal
is
entitled
to
a
double
share
of
our
affection
if
we
follow
our
separate
gratifications
it
will
surely
make
us
neglect
him
whom
we
are
bound
by
vows
both
to
our
father
and
mother
to
support
the
young
man
received
this
address
in
silence
he
appeared
daily
to
grow
more
restive
and
moody
and
one
day
taking
his
bow
and
arrows
left
the
lodge
and
never
returned
affection
nerved
the
sister
s
arm
she
was
not
so
ignorant
of
the
forest
arts
as
to
let
her
brother
want
for
a
long
time
she
administered
to
his
necessities
and
supplied
a
mother
s
cares
at
length
however
she
began
to
be
weary
of
solitude
and
of
her
charge
no
one
came
to
be
a
witness
of
her
assiduity
or
to
let
fall
which
added
to
her
strength
and
capability
of
directing
the
affairs
of
the
household
brought
with
them
the
irrepressible
desire
of
society
and
made
solitude
irksome
at
this
point
selfishness
gained
the
ascendency
of
her
heart
for
in
meditating
a
change
in
her
mode
of
life
she
lost
sight
of
her
younger
brother
and
left
him
to
be
provided
for
by
contingencies

with

and

foot
the
hunter
pressed
onward
to
where
a
sachem
stood
by
the
green
margin
of
the
wood
with
head
of
snow
and
eyes
that
beam
as
calm
and
sweet
and
fall
on

bank
and
stream
not
unexpected
are
you

the
old
man
said

i
know
but
to
the
happy
spirit
home
no
limbs
of
flesh
can
ever
go
leave
here
the
cumbrous
mass
pursue
your
course
the
open
pathway
take
that
ever
leads
the
just
and
true
in
safety
to
the
sacred
lake
there
by
the
pictured
rocks
that
rise
from
the
blue
waters
to
the
skies
are
crystal
boats
that
swiftly
bear
good
spirits
to
the
sacred
isle
and
there
released
from
every
fear
your
eyes
shall
meet
avora
s
smile
more
bright
and
beautiful
than
when
her
spirit
dwelt
with
mortal
men
the
body
s
weight
and
weakness
gone
with
swifter
course
the
hunter
flew
and
farther
as
he
hastened
on
more
wonderful
the
region
grew
no
shadow
from
the
rock
was
cast
in
this
the
dream
land
of
the
dead
through
lofty
trees
his
passage
passed
yet
pauseless
on
the
hunter
sped
he
found
the
endless
store
and
launching
boldly
from
the
strand
upon
the
lake
were
myriads
more
straight
onward
to
the
spirits
home
like
flying
swans
the
vessels
made
their
rapid
course
through
mist
and
foam
in
every
shadowy
boat
a
shade
he
seized
a
boat
the
paddle
plied
nor
thought
of
rising
wave
or
storm
when
in
another
by
his
side
he
wondering
sees
the
maiden
s
form
forward
with
vigorous
arms
they
urge
their
passage
through
the
swelling
surge
that
rises
foaming
on
their
way
with
curling
crest
and
blinding
spray
and
threatens
with
resistless
force
like
a
white
rock
to
bar
their
course
but
as
the
mountain
billows
swell
and
curl
to
crush
the
light
canoe
obedient
to
some
secret
spell
that
ever
guards
the
just
and
true
the
surge
is
hushed
the
waves
subside
and
on
the
calm
unruffled
tide
with
placid
course
the
vessels
glide
while
countless
as
the
fallen
leaves
when
autumn
dyes
and
strews
them
round
wreck
that
spreads
the
ground
where
the
fierce
billows
foam
and
rave
with
deafening
roar
by
furies
tossed
canoes
and
forms
of
chief
and
brave
in
the
wild
deep
are
sunk
and
lost
sunk
by
the
sin
avenging
waves
where
purifying
waters
flow
in
crystal
roofed
and
pillared
caves
downward
the
wailing
spirits
go
there
washed
from
every
taint
and
stain
they
rise
in
time
to
earth
again
but
carried
by
an
unknown
hand
for
other
shadowy
forms
to
try
their
fortune
on
the
pictured
strand
the
bright
canoes
returning
lie
ready
for
those
who
next
explore
a
passage
to
the
sacred
shore
fast
on
they
pass
the
maid
the
youth
the
island
cliffs
that
shine
afar
radiant
as
evening
s
peerless
star
the
guides
of
constancy
and
truth
direct
their
way
upon
the
strand
the
light
prows
grate
they
leap
to
shore
with
hearts
of
rapture
hand
in
hand
the
hills
ascend
the
vales
explore
not
in
those
isles
of
summer
seas
where
and
vales
as
fair
as
these
in
the
blessed
land
the
spirits
home
a
richer
verdure
spreads
the
ground
the
sky
is
of
a
softer
blue
and
scattered
in
profusion
round
are
flowers
of
every
shape
and
hue
their
fragrance
on
the
unsated
breeze
floats
exquisite
and
evermore
on
purple
vines
and
bending
trees
are
various
fruits
an
endless
store
innumerable
birds
prolong
with
chattering
joy
their
dainty
cheer
of
brighter
plume
and
sweeter
song
than
meet
with
mortal
eye
or
ear
the
spotted
fawn
and
timid
doe
browse
the
sweet
shrub
without
a
fear
they
never
dread
the
hunter
s
bow
and
quivered
deaths
that
strike
them
here
not
in
this
gentle
spirit
land
the
warrior
heeds
his
earthly
fame
nor
hunters
drive
with
practiced
hand
and
shining
shafts
their
former
game
no
reptile
crawls
no
falcon
flies
no
beast
prowls
savage
and
alone
nor
snows
nor

nor

no

the
balmy
and
beauty
brightening
every

to

with

keen
and
various
than

rose

her

and

but
pleased
with

the
circle
now
of
eager
hearers
look
to
see
with
lips
compressed
and
anxious
brow
if
the
great
chief
of
yemassee
would
tell
the
been
established
in
carolina
the
latter
province
was
overrun
by
thousands
of
these
marauders
after
this
event
who
had
never
before
set
eyes
upon
her
plains
florida
it
will
be
kept
in
mind
was
the
usual
place
of
refuge
for
the
loyalists
of
the
whole
south
on
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolution
and
during
the
period
of
whig
success
even
as
canada
afforded
a
region
of
retreat
for
all
of
the
same
class
the
cause
of
the
crown
was
simply
a
pretext
with
these
marauders
they
were
nothing
less
than
plunderers
under
the
sanction
of
the
war
sometimes
they
joined
themselves
to
the
regular
service
and
were
employed
as
scouts
and
rangers
but
this
they
found
too
hard
a
service
they
were
then
really
the
menials
of
the
regular
army
and
they
revolted
at
the
servitude
using
the
connection
only
when
it
might
be
thought
necessary
to
countenance
or
shelter
their
excesses
they
followed
a
chief
so
long
as
he
proved
successful
and
shared
his
spoils
freely
among
them
frequently
deposed
him
threw
off
his
rule
for
that
of
another
and
sometimes
merged
their
independent
existence
measurably
in
that
of
superior
bands
but
they
changed
nothing
of
their
nature
in
the
change
of
service
and
were
only
so
many
rude
banditti
always
this
much
will
suffice
for
their
morals
of
their
manners
they
shall
report
themselves
a
rude
cookery
was
begun
soon
after
their
entrance
two
of
the
their
ordinary
occupation
soon
the
corn
hoe
cakes
were
browning
before
the
fire
great
slices
of
bacon
were
hissing
in
the
frying
pan
and
a
pot
of
coffee
was
set
to
boil
but
for
these
comforts
of
the
kitchen
no
one
waited
a
corpulent
jug
of
whiskey
was
already
in
requisition
and
following
the
lead
of
captain
lem
watkins
the
troopers
successively
quaffed
deeply
of
its
potent
waters
then
came
the
supper
they
ate
they
drank
freely
with
something
of
the
appetite
of
famishing
men
there
was
little
talk
among
the
party
the
while
except
such
as
took
place
with
small
groups
who
for
this
purpose
seemingly
occasionally
left
the
house
and
went
out
into
the
thicket
there
was
an
influence
at
work
among
them
not
depressing
exactly
but
one
of
a
sort
to
make
them
reserved
perhaps
sullen
at
all
events
mostly
silent
words
were
spoken
as
if
not
calling
for
answer
those
who
spoke
with
the
hope
of
successful
never
certainly
in
the
former
object
occasionally
the
chief
let
fall
something
that
might
have
been
designed
for
a
jest
or
a
sarcasm
but
the
humor
did
not
spread
if
honored
with
a
chuckle
it
was
but
of
momentary
duration
and
the
result
only
of
some
little
effort
it
was
a
lugubrious
feast
such
as
one
might
be
supposed
to
make
the
night
before
his
execution
there
was
no
song
over
the
supper
the
stillness
of
the
group
suffered
them
all
distinctly
to
hear
at
intervals
the
protracted
whoop
of
the
owl
without
who
noted
the
watches
of
the
night
by
becoming
signals
from
the
ancient
millhouse
it
might
be
seen
that
one
of
the
party
did
not
eat
it
was
observed
finally
by
his
companions
toward
the
close
of
supper
how
now
mat
floyd
said
nat
snell
turning
to
this
person
where
he
sat
aloof
in
a
corner
what
if
you
air
in
trouble
eat
man
ay
let
him
eat
loose
him
awhile
and
let
him
eat
quoth
captain
watkins
we
do
nt
want
to
put
him
on
his
trial
on
an
empty
stomach
loose
him
snell
and
give
him
a
bite
it
sha
nt
be
said
that
we
starve
a
fellow
even
though
we
have
to
hang
him
after
supper
snell
did
as
he
was
commanded
and
proceeded
to
undo
the
cords
which
bound
the
person
addressed
taking
an
opportunity
as
he
did
so
to
whisper
in
his
ear
seize
your
chance
mat
and
git
off
if
you
kin
the
other
sat
quiet
stupidly
it
would
seem
rather
than
gloomily
and
showed
no
disposition
to
rise
from
the
floor
even
when
loosed
from
his
bonds
he
indicated
no
desire
for
supper
what
wo
nt
he
eat
demanded
the
captain
with
an
oath
then
let
him
starve
and
be
d
d
for
a
sulky
fool
as
well
as
do
i
care
if
he
eats
or
not
give
him
time
captain
to
consider
said
the
friendly
follow
called
snell
ay
and
for
his
prayers
too
but
the
sooner
he
s
about
them
the
better
let
him
have
an
hour
and
then
see
that
he
s
roped
up
for
other
matters
only
see
that
he
do
nt
slip
out
put
a
hitch
in
the
door
it
s
past
hitching
was
the
answer
as
one
of
the
party
endeavored
to
fit
the
unwieldy
leaf
of
the
door
to
the
posts
in
spite
of
broken
hinges
there
s
nara
hinge
left
and
not
a
staple
to
hook
to
well
fix
it
as
you
can
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
rascal
see
to
him
snell
you
shall
be
jailer
i
d
rather
you
d
put
somebody
else
that

more
spry
than

i
m
a

and
if
he
s
not
safe
here
the
moment
we
want
him
you
take
his
place
that
s
all
look
to
it
and
now
clean
off
the
table
men
we
ve
got
our
settlements
to
make
and
square
off
the
business
of
this
last
campaign
i
do
nt
want
to
keep
any
shares
but
my
own
and
when
the
paymaster
of
the
squad
plays
traitor
and
makes
off
with
the
chest
i
reckon
there
s
few
of
you
that
would
nt
rather
keep
his
own
money
it
s
not
so
much
the
matter
that
s
left
us
now
to
divide
but
we
ll
take
our
satisfaction
i
reckon
out
of
one
of
the
rascals
gather
round
all
of
you
and
see
if
we
do
what
s
right
there
watts
heave
up
on
in
silence
do
you
know
said
she
it
s
such
a
change
coming
from
new
york
to
live
here
everything
is
so
unformed
so
wild
and
so
lonely
i
never
saw
anything
so
lonesome
as
these
woods
are
here
you
can
ride
miles
and
miles
hours
and
hours
and
hear
nothing
but
the
swaying
of
the
pine
trees
just
as
you
hear
it
now
our
place
you
never
were
there
were
you
stands
all
by
itself
miles
from
any
other
and
i
ve
been
for
so
many
years
used
to
a
thickly
settled
country
that
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
i
ca
nt
help
thinking
things
look
rather
deserted
and
desolate
here
it
makes
me
rather
sober
and
sad
i
do
nt
know
as
you
ll
like
the
appearance
of
our
place
a
great
many
things
are
going
to
decay
about
it
decay
for
papa
was
very
fond
of
trees
and
shrubbery
and
we
have
a
good
deal
more
of
them
than
usual
are
you
fond
of
trees
yes
i
m
almost
a
tree
worshipper
i
have
no
respect
for
a
man
who
ca
nt
appreciate
a
tree
the
only
good
thing
i
ever
heard
of
xerxes
was
that
he
was
so
transported
with
the
beauty
of
a
plane
tree
that
he
hung
it
with
chains
of
gold
this
is
a
little
poetical
island
in
the
barbarism
of
those
days
xerxes
said
nina
i
believe
i
studied
something
about
him
in
that
dismal
tedious
history
at
madame
ardaine
s
but
nothing
so
interesting
as
that
i
m
sure
but
what
should
he
hang
gold
chains
on
a
tree
for
t
was
the
best
way
he
knew
of
expressing
his
good
opinion
do
you
know
said
nina
half
checking
her
horse
suddenly
that
i
never
had
the
about
in
these
histories
or
that
they
had
any
feelings
like
ours
we
always
studied
the
lessons
and
learnt
the
hard
names
and
how
forty
thousand
were
killed
on
one
side
and
fifty
thousand
on
the
other
and
we
do
nt
know
any
more
about
it
than
if
we
never
had
that
s
the
way
we
girls
studied
at
school
except
a
few
poky
ones
who
wanted
to
be
learned
or
meant
to
be
teachers
an
interesting
rsum
certainly
said
clayton
laughing
but
how
strange
it
is
said
nina
to
think
that
all
those
folks
we
read
about
are
alive
now
doing
something
somewhere
and
i
get
to
wondering
where
they
are
xerxes
and
alexander
and
the
rest
of
them
why
they
were
so
full
of
life
they
kept
everything
in
commotion
while
in
this
world
and
i
wonder
if
they
have
been
keeping
a
going
ever
since
perhaps
xerxes
has
been
looking
round
at
our
now
to
the
beginning
of
our
grounds
there
you
see
that
holly
hedge
mamma
had
that
set
out
she
travelled
in
england
and
liked
the
hedges
there
so
much
that
she
thought
she
would
see
what
could
be
done
with
our
american
holly
so
she
had
these
brought
from
the
woods
and
planted
you
see
it
all
grows
wild
now
because
it
has
nt
been
cut
for
many
years
and
this
live
oak
avenue
my
grandfather
set
out
it
s
my
pride
and
delight
as
she
spoke
a
pair
of
broad
gates
swung
open
and
they
cantered
in
beneath
the
twilight
arches
of
the
oaks
long
wreaths
of
pearly
moss
hung
swinging
from
the
branches
and
although
the
sun
now
was
at
high
noon
a
dewy
dreamy
coolness
seemed
to
rustle
through
all
the
leaves
as
clayton
passed
in
he
took
off
his
hat
as
he
had
often
done
in
foreign
countries
in
cathedrals
welcome
to
canema
said
she
riding
up
to
him
air
half
queenly
half
childish
with
which
this
was
said
was
acknowledged
by
clayton
with
a
grave
smile
as
he
replied
bowing
thank
you
madam
perhaps
she
added
in
a
grave
tone
you
ll
be
sorry
that
you
ever
came
here
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
replied
i
do
nt
know
it
just
came
into
my
head
to
say
it
we
none
of
us
ever
know
what
s
going
to
come
of
what
we
do
at
this
instant
a
violent
clamor
like
the
cawing
of
a
crow
rose
on
one
side
of
the
avenue
and
the
moment
after
tomtit
appeared
caricoling
and
cutting
a
somerset
his
curls
flying
his
cheeks
glowing
why
tomtit
what
upon
earth
is
this
for
said
nina
laws
missis
deres
been
a
gen
elman
waiting
for
you
at
the
house
these
two
hours
and
missis
and
gone
down
in
the
parlor
for
him
nina
felt
herself
blush
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
was
vexed
and
provoked
to
think
she
did
so
involuntarily
her
eyes
met
clayton
s
but
he
expressed
neither
curiosity
nor
concern
what
a
pretty
drapery
this
light
moss
makes
said
he
i
was
nt
aware
that
it
grew
so
high
up
in
the
state
yes
it
is
very
pretty
said
nina
abstractedly
clayton
however
had
noticed
both
the
message
and
the
blush
and
was
not
so
ill
informed
as
nina
supposed
as
to
the
whole
affair
having
heard
from
a
new
york
correspondent
of
the
probability
that
an
arrival
might
appear
upon
the
field
about
this
time
he
was
rather
curious
to
watch
the
development
produced
by
this
event
they
paced
up
the
avenue
conversing
in
disconnected
intervals
till
they
came
out
on
the
lawn
which
fronted
the
mansion
a
large
gray
three
story
building
surrounded
on
the
four
sides
by
wide
of
these
by
a
broad
flight
of
steps
and
there
nina
saw
plain
enough
her
aunt
nesbit
in
all
the
proprieties
of
cap
and
silk
gown
sitting
making
the
agreeable
to
mr
carson
mr
frederic
augustus
carson
was
one
of
those
nice
little
epitomes
of
conventional
society
which
appear
to
such
advantage
in
factitious
life
and
are
so
out
of
place
in
the
undress
sincere
surroundings
of
country
life
nina
had
liked
his
society
extremely
well
in
the
drawing
rooms
of
the
indians
were
sharper
and
they
all
understood
alike
and
therefore
they
do
not
differ
about
what
the
master
of
life
said
and
they
also
know
better
concerning
hobbamocki
has
not
my
brother
told
me
that
the
white
men
fight
and
kill
one
another
about
their
religion
alas
it
is
too
true
replied
sir
christopher
indians
never
do
so
let
us
do
a
great
thing
added
sassacus
his
face
suddenly
kindling
as
with
the
inspiration
of
a
magnificent
thought
we
will
teach
the
english
our
religion
which
we
never
fight
about
because
we
know
it
to
be
true
and
the
english
shall
teach
powder
and
together
we
will
drive
the
taranteens
into
the
salt
lake
it
is
in
vain
said
the
knight
to
himself
on
hearing
this
extraordinary
proposition
he
doth
ever
in
his
childlike
simplicity
say
something
to
confound
me
his
untutored
mind
is
yet
incapable
of
receiving
the
mysteries
of
our
holy
religion
but
in
lieu
thereof
perpetually
runs
after
the
practical
and
immediate
advantages
of
powder
and
guns
direct
the
conversation
as
i
may
this
target
doth
it
hit
at
last
at
this
moment
an
indian
stepped
into
the
lodge
and
uttering
the
word
fire
accompanied
by
a
gesture
of
the
arm
retired
the
knight
and
sassacus
sprung
up
and
looking
in
the
direction
indicated
beheld
the
heavens
all
aglow
with
the
conflagration
it
is
my
lodge
exclaimed
sir
christopher
i
will
hasten
thither
instantly
come
with
us
towanquattick
said
the
chief
calling
to
the
indian
dwelling
of
the
knight
with
all
their
haste
they
did
not
reach
it
until
the
fire
had
made
such
progress
that
it
was
impossible
to
suppress
it
or
even
save
anything
from
the
building
the
flames
were
pouring
out
in
billows
from
the
doors
and
windows
and
a
moment
after
their
arrival
the
roof
fell
in
they
approached
as
near
as
the
heat
would
permit
but
were
unable
to
distinguish
anything
in
the
interior
nor
was
a
sound
to
be
heard
save
that
of
the
rushing
flames
and
falling
timbers
no
one
was
present
except
the
three
the
natives
who
lived
near
having
retired
deeper
into
the
wood
on
the
first
alarm
leaning
on
his
gun
the
knight
gazed
sadly
on
the
burning
ruin
reflecting
on
what
had
probably
become
of
its
former
occupants
if
he
had
any
doubts
they
were
soon
dissipated
by
sassacus
whose
attention
with
that
of
the
other
indian
had
been
attracted
by
marks
upon
the
ground
which
had
escaped
the
notice
of
sir
christopher
these
plainly
revealed
two
like
well
bred
hounds
had
been
examining
in
every
direction
until
gathering
together
the
various
tracks
into
one
trail
they
had
followed
it
into
the
wood
returning
to
the
knight
and
pointing
out
the
traces
the
chief
said
many
owanux
have
been
here
and
all
are
gone
to
shawmut
i
surmised
as
much
said
sir
christopher
partly
to
himself
we
will
follow
sagamore
and
assure
ourselves
with
our
own
eyes
no
time
was
lost
in
lamentation
but
the
three
instantly
started
after
the
band
sir
christopher
could
see
the
trail
until
it
reached
the
wood
but
here
notwithstanding
his
experience
in
woodcraft
he
frequently
lost
all
trace
of
it
though
to
the
indians
it
seemed
as
plain
as
a
beaten
highway
never
hesitating
even
in
the
obscurest
recesses
of
the
forest
where
penetrated
no
ray
of
a
star
with
rapid
steps
they
pursued
their
way
meanwhile
the
party
of
soldiers
conscious
of
their
strength
and
encumbered
a
good
pace
had
of
late
been
proceeding
more
leisurely
even
lieutenant
venn
satisfied
that
they
would
be
able
without
haste
to
reach
their
destination
before
daylight
ceased
to
hurry
as
they
approached
nearer
the
village
their
vigilance
diminished
the
men
talked
loud
and
jested
with
one
another
and
it
was
obvious
that
no
apprehensions
of
danger
were
entertained
this
state
of
things
had
not
been
unnoticed
by
philip
who
had
been
meditating
over
the
question
whether
it
were
not
better
to
make
an
attempt
to
escape
there
is
no
great
hazard
in
it
he
said
to
himself
but
were
i
to
get
away
i
should
be
about
as
badly
off
as
now
unless
i
could
meet
sir
christopher
or
the
sagamore
and
perhaps
they
have
been
captured
by
some
other
party
for
our
folk
do
not
things
by
halves
they
have
taken
away
my
snap
chance
too
and
i
can
not
shoot
with
arrows
like
a
savage
so
that
as
one
may
say
i
am
a
sort
can
have
against
me
now
or
why
i
should
be
afraid
of
them
and
yet
when
i
think
of
their
purgatory
of
a
prison
it
makes
me
crawl
all
over
a
week
s
lodging
there
would
about
make
an
end
of
me
i
think
i
have
never
been
quite
the
man
i
was
before
since
they
stuck
me
there
thus
revolving
in
his
mind
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
his
position
the
remembrance
of
his
sufferings
during
his
imprisonment
at
last
turned
the
scales
in
favor
of
liberty
and
philip
began
to
think
of
means
to
accomplish
his
purpose
he
tried
by
lagging
behind
and
falling
down
once
or
twice
to
get
into
the
rear
but
this
manoeuvre
the
vigilant
eyes
of
lieutenant
venn
detected
who
ordered
him
nearer
to
the
front
and
directed
that
he
should
be
watched
closer
foiled
in
this
manner
that
freedom
which
but
a
moment
before
and
when
apparently
in
his
power
seemed
almost
a
matter
of
indifference
assumed
a
constantly
increasing
importance
ever
in
a
short
time
they
would
be
out
of
the
forest
when
any
attempt
at
evasion
would
be
folly
for
should
he
succeed
in
shaking
off
his
guard
he
would
run
great
risk
of
being
shot
down
in
the
open
space
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
think
quickly
if
i
only
had
prudence
with
me
thought
philip
i
be
bound
she
would
have
invented
a
dozen
ways
to
get
off
by
this
time
sweet
wench
there
is
some
difference
between
sitting
on
a
log
no
inconsiderate
impulse
that
she
had
thus
set
herself
to
the
fulfilment
of
her
heaven
appointed
mission
she
had
thoroughly
measured
and
fully
understood
the
sacrifice
it
would
involve
she
knew
that
in
consecrating
herself
to
duty
and
to
god
she
must
dethrone
her
young
heart
s
earthly
idol
that
the
selfish
love
must
yield
to
the
purely
disinterested
the
human
to
the
divine
had
it
been
otherwise
she
would
not
so
long
have
been
deaf
to
the
call
which
summoned
her
to
her
master
s
service
beguiled
by
a
persuasive
intellect
enthralled
by
the
power
of
genius
and
a
willing
captive
in
the
chains
which
flattery
so
well
knows
how
to
forge
she
had
wandered
awhile
through
the
flowery
fields
of
pleasure
had
reached
the
pinnacle
of
her
ambition
had
sunned
herself
in
dreams
of
future
bliss
but
there
came
a
time
when
the
simple
words
of
an
infant
tongue
had
aroused
the
the
hand
of
a
little
child
she
had
at
length
been
brought
back
to
the
feet
of
that
faithful
monitor
of
her
youth
by
the
memory
of
whose
warning
counsels
and
by
the
aid
of
whose
blessed
gift
she
would
henceforth
pursue
in
patience
the
path
which
leadeth
unto
life
ambitious
only
to
accomplish
the
work
which
was
given
her
to
do
and
cheered
by
the
hopes
which
are
full
of
immortality
in
this
hour
of
exaltation
this
season
of
the
spirit
s
victory
the
task
did
not
seem
hard
already
was
the
self
imposed
duty
lightened
by
that
sweetener
of
life
s
heaviest
toils
which
relieves
the
laborer
of
half
his
burthen
for
in
the
moment
when
denying
self
she
assumed
with
holy
fortitude
the
sacred
guardianship
of
her
brother
back
to
her
heart
in
a
full
strong
tide
came
all
the
depth
and
tenderness
of
that
sisterly
love
which
had
only
been
subdued
and
crushed
by
the
force
of
a
rival
passion
thus
not
only
would
she
devote
herself
to
harry
s
in
view
of
every
touching
memory
of
their
childhood
every
sweet
record
of
their
maturer
years
her
heart
forbade
her
to
desert
him
as
she
now
moved
through
the
room
preparing
to
put
her
purpose
into
execution
her
countenance
was
marked
by
the
serene
composure
of
one
animated
by
a
high
resolve
and
inspired
by
a
holy
mission
her
manner
was
no
longer
indicative
of
hesitation
or
uncertainty
and
the
hands
which
an
hour
ago
had
trembled
with
nervous
indecision
performed
what
they
had
to
do
quickly
and
well
she
wrote
a
hasty
note
to
louise
explaining
her
change
of
plan
but
giving
no
other
reason
for
abandoning
the
journey
than
the
simple
truth
that
at
the
last
moment
she
had
become
convinced
that
her
presence
was
needed
at
home
she
begged
her
sister
to
write
to
her
frequently
sent
her
love
to
the
boys
hoped
cecilia
would
faithfully
supply
lydia
s
place
and
that
louise
would
in
the
enjoyment
of
other
society
have
little
occasion
to
regret
her
absence
which
latter
reasonably
indulge
since
mrs
leroy
was
when
in
general
society
extremely
indifferent
to
family
ties
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
cecilia
returned
from
the
hotel
weary
and
with
her
own
preparations
for
the
journey
still
incomplete
she
was
amazed
at
the
sight
of
mabel
s
trunk
which
was
still
empty
while
every
article
of
her
scattered
wardrobe
was
restored
to
its
customary
place
i
am
not
going
cecilia
said
mabel
calmly
in
answer
to
her
look
of
astonishment
take
this
note
to
my
sister
in
the
morning
when
you
meet
her
at
the
boat
robert
will
see
to
your
baggage
remember
and
take
good
care
of
the
boys
and
she
dismissed
her
with
a
parting
charge
to
retire
as
soon
as
possible
as
she
would
be
obliged
to
rise
early
not
until
she
had
thus
confirmed
by
act
the
heroic
resolution
of
her
mind
did
she
realize
the
exhaustion
consequent
upon
agitation
and
excitement
but
now
with
a
welcome
sense
of
relief
from
to
which
she
had
looked
for
strength
she
gladly
sought
the
rest
which
tired
nature
craves
and
fell
into
a
sweet
and
dreamless
sleep
such
as
for
many
a
week
had
deserted
her
pillow
chapter
xxii
in
her
deep
melancholy
eye
life
s
brilliant
hues
no
longer
lie
and
love
itself
its
sweetest
light
has
left
behind
a
starless
night
a
night
ah
no
t
is
early
dawn
the
long
dark
hopeless
hours
are
gone
and
faith
the
day
spring
from
on
high
is
beaming
through
her
heavenward
eye
mrs
s
c
e
mayo
if
the
exaltation
of
soul
under
which
a
high
resolve
is
usually
formed
could
be
maintained
during
the
period
required
for
its
fulfilment
the
battle
would
be
fought
and
the
victory
achieved
almost
without
an
effort
but
who
has
not
experienced
the
reaction
weakness
and
self
distrust
which
are
the
natural
consequence
of
an
unwonted
strain
upon
the
physical
and
mental
powers
then
indeed
do
we
learn
how
little
sustained
and
strengthened
by
help
and
guidance
from
on
high
so
it
was
with
mabel
when
she
awoke
the
morning
after
her
supposed
self
conquest
oppressed
with
a
painful
sense
of
lassitude
and
despondency
which
made
it
an
effort
to
rise
and
dress
and
a
still
greater
effort
to
look
back
upon
the
past
with
composure
and
forward
into
the
future
with
cheerfulness
she
fully
realized
the
unexpected
truth
that
not
by
one
spasmodic
effort
can
the
soul
achieve
the
sublime
heights
of
self
denying
virtue
but
only
by
continual
and
persevering
struggles
and
a
patient
resting
upon
him
whose
promise
is
steadfast
i
will
never
leave
you
nor
forsake
you
fortunately
her
little
bible
was
close
at
hand
with
its
blessed
words
of
encouragement
and
peace
and
after
resorting
to
its
pages
for
counsel
and
commending
herself
to
heaven
in
prayer
she
felt
in
some
degree
prepared
to
meet
the
events
of
the
day
in
the
hall
leading
to
the
dining
room
she
met
robert
who
reported
the
departure
of
the
high
spirits
early
one
morning
and
conducted
themselves
so
riotously
that
the
simple
minded
people
of
quiet
jollifee
were
thrown
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
and
imagining
them
demons
escaped
from
the
infernal
regions
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
terrified
out
of
town
and
this
was
regarded
as
a
great
blessing
for
the
vagabond
army
numbering
not
less
than
five
hundred
took
possession
of
their
houses
and
made
clean
work
of
their
poultry
yards
which
fortunately
for
the
commander
in
chief
were
well
stocked
but
what
pleased
general
potter
most
was
that
glenmoregain
advised
him
of
for
there
was
no
lack
of
such
vagabonds
in
new
york
and
heaven
knew
it
would
be
a
blessing
to
get
rid
of
and
when
they
had
sent
terror
and
dismay
to
the
hearts
of
the
poor
natives
and
plundered
their
homes
and
revelled
to
their
heart
s
content
general
potter
feeling
in
every
inch
of
him
how
great
it
was
to
be
commander
in
chief
directed
that
his
generals
appear
before
him
that
he
might
consult
with
them
concerning
various
projects
of
war
he
had
in
his
head
in
obedience
then
to
this
sum
mons
there
appeared
before
him
at
least
twenty
generals
and
as
many
major
generals
not
one
of
whom
had
ever
scented
the
perfume
of
battle
for
ill
truth
they
were
dilapidated
politicians
and
editors
whose
lack
of
brains
and
love
of
the
bottle
had
brought
them
to
the
very
verge
of
distress
and
when
they
had
partaken
of
the
general
s
good
cheer
he
addressed
them
as
follows
gentlemen
conscious
that
you
are
all
brave
soldiers
i
would
have
say
for
i
am
no
fool
and
intend
to
have
satisfaction
of
this
king
for
the
insult
he
offered
to
our
country
in
compelling
me
to
sit
upon
the
ice
know
then
that
i
have
resolved
to
make
the
penalty
the
loss
of
his
kingdom
and
as
i
see
you
are
all
patriots
pray
bear
in
mind
how
great
is
the
undertaking
if
we
fail
why
then
there
will
be
enough
to
sneer
at
us
if
we
be
victorious
then
the
valor
of
our
arms
will
be
sung
and
glorified
in
many
lands
remember
that
success
closes
malicious
mouths
be
heroes
then
see
that
your
swords
be
sharp
and
your
wits
not
blunted
for
i
hold
that
there
is
no
judgment
so
just
as
that
of
a
country
conferring
honors
upon
the
brave
and
he
who
earns
the
glory
shall
have
it
as
to
myself
you
shall
see
more
of
me
when
the
enemy
affords
me
a
chance
but
forget
not
that
my
motto
is
compositum
jus
fasque
animi
make
no
doubt
is
familiar
enough
to
you
to
morrow
we
will
march
against
the
enemy
so
let
no
man
say
he
is
sick
the
generals
were
not
a
little
diverted
by
this
speech
which
i
venture
to
assert
was
never
excelled
for
originality
though
many
stranger
addresses
have
been
made
by
commanders
in
chief
to
their
officers
indeed
they
were
not
long
in
discovering
all
the
weaknesses
of
the
man
and
questioned
among
themselves
whether
it
were
better
to
yield
him
explicit
obedience
or
set
him
down
for
a
fool
and
treat
him
accordingly
they
however
took
their
departure
promising
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
in
fine
that
his
orders
would
be
obeyed
to
the
letter
and
when
they
were
gone
general
potter
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looking
askant
at
his
secretary
who
had
remained
silent
during
the
interview
said
honestly
mr
tickler
i
would
like
to
have
your
opinion
respecting
these
gentlemen
generals
of
mine
for
they
seem
a
set
of
scurvy
fellows
and
have
much
need
of
s
ear
he
continued
and
there
is
a
flavor
about
them
by
no
means
agreeable
and
unless
i
be
a
bad
prophet
either
the
devil
has
been
painting
all
their
noses
or
they
have
long
been
familiar
with
the
bottle
faith
of
the
saints
if
your
excellency
would
know
what
i
think
of
them
it
is
this
that
barring
you
have
the
capacity
of
wellington
and
napoleon
combined
you
will
have
your
hands
full
in
keeping
these
generals
from
making
war
upon
one
another
though
you
may
find
it
difficult
to
keep
the
army
to
their
fighting
when
the
enemy
appears
i
have
them
in
my
power
tickler
replied
the
general
giving
his
head
a
significant
toss
and
if
they
keep
not
peace
between
themselves
then
i
will
order
them
all
hanged
and
as
the
rules
of
the
service
must
not
be
broken
i
will
take
good
care
that
they
show
me
that
deference
due
to
my
high
position
what
is
more
friend
tickler
is
an
honor
of
no
mean
quality
and
which
is
here
conferred
upon
you
out
of
respect
to
your
great
learning
mr
tickler
shook
his
head
and
stroked
his
beard
despondingly
it
is
well
enough
to
be
judge
your
excellency
but
as
i
have
a
fear
the
honors
you
seem
so
free
to
lavish
upon
me
would
not
keep
house
well
with
my
poverty
i
would
prefer
first
to
have
that
relieved
do
not
forget
that
our
man
has
fed
us
on
stolen
provisions
for
these
three
weeks
replied
mr
tickler
an
end
was
put
to
this
dialogue
by
the
general
reminding
mr
tickler
that
men
of
great
learning
ought
always
to
be
patriots
since
history
furnished
proofs
enough
of
their
great
endurance
under
poverty
on
the
following
day
the
general
mounted
his
faithful
horse
and
with
mr
tickler
on
his
mule
proceeded
to
review
his
army
of
vagabonds
and
though
he
complimented
them
on
the
great
perfection
of
their
drill
and
bid
them
esteem
themselves
the
heroes
of
no
a
set
of
fellows
as
ever
shouldered
musket
in
short
not
one
of
them
knew
how
to
take
the
first
move
in
forming
a
section
though
they
could
rob
hen
roosts
and
banana
fields
with
a
facility

remarkable

sky
for
savage
yells
and
shrieks
of
earlier
days
swells
the
soft
solemn
voice
of
sabbath
praise
while
teachers
toil
with
earnest
zeal
to
find
each
easier
access
to
the
rustic
mind
and
where
from
nature
s
scenes
the
indian
drew
of
nature
s
author
all
the
love
he
knew
to
purer
faith
they
bid
her
forms
convey
a
clearer
light
to
guide
the
rustic
s
way
he
sees
with
pensive
eye
the
forest
round
restore
its
faded
foliage
to
flower
more
grateful
thoughts
for
genial
dew
and
shower
and
when
with
heavier
hand
he
turns
the
soil
digs
breaks
and
harrows
with
redoubled
toil
and
sees
as
deeper
sinks
the
rugged
share
that
richer
harvests
fill
the
closing
year
so
too
he
finds
when
troubles
harder
grow
and
the
torn
bosom
s
ploughed
with
sharper
woe
from
seeming
griefs
celestial
pleasures
rise
and
the
heart
s
harvest
blossoms
for
the
skies
he
feels
the
heavenly
husbandman
s
controul
and
learns
how
sorrows
fertilize
the
soul
such
thoughts
they
gain
from
men
in
humble
guise
though
rude
in
garb
in
saintly
wisdom
wise
trained
by
no
college
to
their
simple
creed
and
bold
and
hardy
as
the

they
feed
the

furnishing

the

their

at

close
broad
sheltering
oaks
invite
them
to
repose
their
steps
no
danger
toil
nor

the
forest
echoes
to
their
song
of
praise
as
strong
in
faith
through
pathless
woods
they
ride
the
sun
or
mossy
trunk
of
trees
their
guide
and
steadfast
like
the
sun
to

hasten
to

how

almost
a
magician
s
power
in
recalling
past
scenes
and
clothing
them
with
their
first
life
when
you
review
it
a
single
line
like
a
seed
thought
draws
around
it
countless
associations
its
wand
long
since
read
and
they
pour
out
their
wealth
anew
forgotten
events
and
they
burst
brightly
upon
memory
buried
feelings
and
they
are
quickened
in
their
graves
to
a
resurrection
so
by
the
aid
of
this
silent
annal
the
unwritten
pages
of
life
are
made
plainer
and
more
vivid
than
those
which
the
pen
has
traced
the
breath
of
the
frost
king
hastening
before
his
time
has
not
yet
prevailed
to
whiten
the
dew
drops
but
he
has
torn
the
leaves
from
their
boughs
and
turned
them
brown
tossing
them
about
spitefully
ah
what
have
they
done
thus
to
be
abandoned
to
a
tyrant
s
power
greenly
had
they
waved
making
the
landscape
beautiful
and
hurting
none
they
had
perhaps
looked
into
the
nests
of
the
birds
and
spread
a
cool
curtain
over
them
while
they
slept
and
thrilled
with
joy
at
their
morning
song
innocent
were
their
lives
and
lovely
but
the
birds
have
flown
away
to
a
warmer
clime
and
forgotten
their
die
with
none
to
mourn
for
them
the
happiest
anniversary
of
our
blessed
redeemer
s
birth
that
i
have
ever
known
impressive
and
delightful
were
its
sacred
ceremonies
in
the
sanctuary
sermon
music
and
all
the
services
seemed
in
unison
with
the
angel
s
song
on
the
plains
of
bethlehem
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
men
almost
like
inspiration
breathed
that
sweet
old
hymn
while
shepherds
watch
d
their
flocks
by
night
all
seated
on
the
ground
the
exchange
of
gifts
at
the
early
morn
softened
and
cheered
our
hearts
while
the
love
of
god
and
of
each
other
with
the
high
praises
of
him
whose
coming
was
our
salvation
made
earth
like
heaven
the
children
of
my
home
school
were
not
forgotten
in
our
joy
the
saturday
after
christmas
was
a
festival
for
them
each
was
permitted
to
invite
two
guests
and
generally
brought
their
parents
or
sisters
while
a
few
of
our
own
intimate
friends
came
to
witness
the
scene
the
pupils
entered
two
in
white
aprons
with
long
sleeves
made
by
their
own
needles
for
this
occasion
from
materials
given
by
my
mother
they
saluted
the
company
with
a
respectful
courtesy
answered
a
few
simple
questions
about
what
they
had
learned
and
read
very
slowly
and
distinctly
a
verse
or
two
from
the
sermon
on
the
mount
our
good
minister
made
them
a
kind
little
address
which
they
seemed
to
comprehend
then
they
received
their
gifts
with
thanks
and
joyous
faces
henry
having
had
a
nice
basket
made
for
each
by
an
indian
woman
whom
he
patronizes
presented
them
filled
with
cakes
and
fruits
which
they
were
to
carry
home
and
share
with
their
families
instead
of
selfishly
consuming
my
grandfather
s
gift
was
a
pair
of
thick
shoes
my
own
a
warm
shawl
and
my
mother
s
a
nice
quilted
hood
on
which
we
had
both
been
for
some
time
busily
engaged
so
that
the
whole
class
will
now
be
in
a
plain
comfortable
uniform
we
had
selected
such
articles
as
we
knew

pressing
into
the
hands
of
such
as
had
aged
relatives
at
home
parcels
which
he
had
privately
prepared
for
them
blessed
old
man
at
parting
they
stood
in
a
circle
taking
hold
of
hands
and
sang
to
a
simple
tune
the
following
still
more
simple
strain
we
will
sing
companions
all
on
this
christmas
festival
sing
with
hearts
of
joyous
cheer
to
our
friend
our
savior

watchfulness
of
the
compassionate
redeemer
to
the
spirit
of
grace
and
consolation
to
the
unslumbering
former
of
our
bodies
eternity
yet
oh
eternity
s
too
short
to
utter
all
thy
praise
i
think
the
chief
value
of
a
conservatory
is
to
furnish
tokens
of
friendship
and
cheering
gifts
for
the
sick
our
own
has
been
so
prosperous
as
to
supply
us
bountifully
for
such
purposes
one
class
of
these
opportunities
has
been
more
frequent
than
usual
many
of
our
acquaintances
having
suffered
from
an
epidemic
influenza
whose
effects
are
singularly
debilitating
among
them
has
been
emily
and
in
sending
emma
were
in
bed
leave
the
side
of
her
sick
child
though
with
painful
reluctance
and
resume
her
toil
but
ever
and
anon
as
ella
moaned
or
tossed
restlessly
upon
her
pillow
would
the
mother
lay
by
her
work
of
spirit
or
inquire
where
she
suffered
pain
or
what
she
could
do
to
relieve
her
thus
passed
the
hours
until
twelve
one
and
two
o
clock
the
mother
feeling
that
her
child
was
too
sick
for
her
to
seek
repose
and
yet
as
she
could
do
nothing
to
relieve
her
sufferings
she
could
not
sit
idly
by
and
look
upon
her
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
at
a
time
she
would
ply
her
needle
and
then
get
up
and
bend
over
the
bed
for
a
minute
or
two
a
thought
of
duty
would
again
call
her
back
to
her
position
by
the
work
table
where
she
would
again
devote
herself
to
her
task
in
spite
of
an
aching
head
and
a
reluctant
over
wearied
body
thus
she
continued
until
near
daylight
when
there
was
an
apparent
subsidence
of
ella
s
most
painful
symptoms
the
child
ceased
to
moan
and
throw
herself
about
and
finally
sunk
into
slumber
in
some
relief
of
mind
mrs
gaston
laid
down
beside
her
upon
the
bed
when
she
awoke
the
sun
had
been
up
some
time
and
was
shining
brightly
into
the
room
quickly
rising
her
first
glance
was
toward
her
sick
child
she
could
scarcely
suppress
a
cry
of
agony
as
she
perceived
that
her
face
and
neck
had
swollen
so
as
to
appear
puffed
up
while
her
skin
was
covered
with
livid
spots
an
examination
of
the
chest
and
stomach
showed
that
these
spots
were
extending
themselves
over
her
whole
body
besides
these
signs
of
danger
the
breathing
of
the
child
was
more
like
gasping
as
she
lay
with
her
mouth
half
opened
the
mother
laid
her
hand
upon
her
arm
and
spoke
to
her
but
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
voice
ella
dear
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
repeated
mrs
gaston
in
louder
and
more
earnest
tones
but
the
child
heeded
her
not
she
was
already
past
consciousness
at
an
early
hour
doctor
r
came
in
the
moment
he
looked
at
his
patient
his
countenance
fell
every
symptom
was
alarming
and
indicated
a
speedy
fatal
termination
this
was
especially
the
case
with
the
upper
part
of
the
throat
which
was
black
nothing
deeper
could
be
seen
as
the
tonsils
were
so
swollen
as
to
threaten
suffocation
is
there
any
hope
doctor
asked
mrs
gaston
eagerly
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
as
he
turned
from
the
bed
there
is
always
hope
where
there
is
life
madam
he
replied
abstractedly
and
then
in
a
thoughtful
mood
took
two
or
three
turns
across
the
narrow
apartment
i
will
come
again
in
an
hour
he
at
length
said
and
see
if
there
is
any
change
i
would
rather
not
give
her
any
more
medicine
for
the
present
let
her
remain
perfectly
quiet
true
to
his
promise
doctor
r
entered
the
room
just
an
hour
from
the
time
he
left
it
the
scene
that
met
his
eye
moved
his
heart
deeply
all
used
as
he
was
to
the
daily
exhibition
was
dead
he
was
prepared
for
that
but
not
for
the
abandoned
grief
to
which
the
mother
gave
way
the
chords
of
feeling
had
been
drawn
in
her
heart
too
tightly
mind
and
body
were
both
out
of
tune
and
discordant
in
suffering
in
abject
want
and
destitution
her
heart
still
clung
to
her
children
and
threw
around
them
a
sphere
of
intenser
affection
as
all
that
was
external
grew
darker
colder
and
more
dreary
they
were
her
jewels
and
she
could
not
part
with
them
they
were
hidden
away
in
her
heart
of
hearts
so
deeply
that
not
a
single
one
of
them
could
be
taken
without
leaving
it
lacerated
and
bleeding
when
the
doctor
entered
he
found
her
lying
upon
the
bed
with
the
body
of
her
child
hugged
tightly
to
her
bosom
little
emma
had
crept
away
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
looked
frightened
henry
was
crouching
in
a
chair
with
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
in
streams
you
are
too
late
tone
so
calm
so
clear
and
yet
to
his
ear
so
thrilling
that
he
started
and
felt
a
chill
pass
through
his
frame
there
was
something
in
the
sound
of
that
voice
in
ill
accordance
with
the
scene
as
she
spoke
she
glanced
at
the
physician
with
bright
tearless
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
turning
away
her
head
she
laid
her
cheek
against
that
of
the
corpse
and
drew
the
lifeless
body
with
trembling
eagerness
to
her
heart
this
is
all
vain
my
dear
madam
urged
dr
r
approaching
the
bedside
and
laying
his
hand
upon
her
come
be
a
woman
to
bear
is
to
conquer
our
fate
no
sorrow
of
yours
can
call
back
the
happy
spirit
of
your
child
and
surely
you
would
not
call
her
back
if
you
could
to
live
over
the
days
of
anguish
and
pain
that
were
meted
out
to
her
i
can
not
give
up
my
child
doctor
oh
will
break
my
heart
she
replied
her
voice
rising
and
trembling
more
and
more
at
each
sentence
until
it
gave
way
and
the
hot
tears
came
raining
over
her
face
and
falling
upon
the
insensible
cheek
of
her
child
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
taketh
away
mrs
gaston
can
you
not
look
up
even
in
this
sore
affliction
and
say
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
it
is
your
only
hope
an
arm
of
flesh
can
not
support
you
now
you
must
look
to
the
strong
for
strength
as
doctor
r
thus
urged
her
to
reason
and
duty
the
tears
of
the
bereaved
mother
gradually
ceased
to
flow
she
grew
calmer
and
regained
in
some
degree
her
self
possession
as
she
did
so
she
slowly
disengaged
her
arm
from
the
body
of

child
placed
its
vision
of
thy
face
hath
overpowering
charms
scarce
shall
i
feel

cold
embrace
if
christ
be
in
my
arms
the
piece
of
paper
which
would
suffice
to
write
the
twenty
third
psalm
upon
it
would
not
be
large
enough
for
a
common
title
deed
and
yet
that
psalm
if
it
expresses
our
experience
is
worth
infinitely
more
than
is
conveyed
or
secured
by
all
the
registries
of
deeds
under
the
sun
we
are
each
of
truth
of
this
if
but
these
first
few
words
of
the
psalm
are
true
in
my
case
if
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
all
the
rest
of
the
psalm
is
a
record
a
promise
a
pledge
of
past
present
and
future
good
there
are
six
things
declared
by
christ
to
be
characteristic
of
the
relation
which
he
and
his
people
sustain
to
each
other
as
shepherd
and
the
sheep
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
and
i
give
unto
them
eternal
life
and
they
shall
never
perish
neither
shall
any
pluck
them
out
of
my
hand
here
we
find
directions
to
duty
as
well
as
promises
of
future
good
since
it
is
more
important
how
we
live
than
how
we
die
and
since
death
is
merely
the
arrival
at
the
end
of
a
journey
the
beginning
progress
and
history
of
the
journey
determining
what
the
dismiss
our
borrowed
trouble
with
regard
to
the
manner
of
our
departure
out
of
the
world
and
be
solicitous
only
with
regard
to
the
right
discharge
of
present
duty
we
read
precious
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
is
the
death
of
his
saints
the
death
of
every
child
of
his
is
with
god
an
object
of
unspeakable
interest
his
own
honor
is
concerned
in
it
its
influence
on
survivors
is
of
great
importance
it
will
be
among
the
means
by
which
god
accomplishes
several
it
may
be
many
purposes
of
providence
but
especially
of
his
grace
no
man
dieth
to
himself
great
interests
are
involved
in
his
death
beyond
his
own
personal
welfare
now
if
we
have
lived
for
god
he
will
make
our
death
the
object
of
his
especial
care
and
will
honor
it
by
its
being
the
means
of
promoting
his
glory
instead
therefore
of
gloomy
apprehensions
as
to
dying
we
should
cherish
the
noble
wish
and
aim
that
christ
may
life
or
by
death
if
our
life
has
been
a
walking
with
god
thou
art
with
me
will
be
a
perfect
warrant
now
and
in
death
to
fear
no
evil
iii
the
search
for
the
departed
no
bliss
mid
worldly
crowds
is
bred
like
musing
on
the
sainted
dead
bishop
mant
we
seek
in
vain
on
earth
for
one
who
has
gone
to
heaven
though
better
informed
as
to
the
objects
of
our
love
than
they
who
lingered
about
the
deserted
tomb
of
the
saviour
and
were
asked
why
seek
ye
the
living
among
the
dead
we
nevertheless
find
ourselves
in
our
thoughts
searching
for
them
so
difficult
is
it
at
once
to
feel
that
they
are
wholly
and
forever
departed
there
is
an
affecting
and
beautifully
simple
illustration
of
our
thoughts
and
feelings
in
this
respect
in
the
search
which
was
made
for
elijah
after
his
translation
fifty
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
went
and
stood
to
view
jordan
elisha
returned
alone
and
these
men
could
not
feel
reconciled
to
the
loss
of
their
great
master
they
were
not
persuaded
that
he
had
gone
to
heaven
no
more
to
return
they
sought
leave
to
seek
him
and
to
recover
him
peradventure
they
said
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
taken
him
up
and
cast
him
upon
some
mountain
or
into
some
valley
elisha
peremptorily
refused
to
grant
them
leave
they
were
importunate
and
when
at
last
it
would
perhaps
seem
like
obstinacy
in
him
or
like
jealousy
of
their
superior
love
for
elijah
to
forbid
the
search
which
at
the
worst
would
only
be
fruitless
he
yielded
three
days
they
explored
the
valleys
ransacked
the
thickets
groped
in
the
caves
traversed
hills
followed
imaginary
trails
and
footprints
but
found
him
not
when
they
came
again
to
elisha
he
said
unto
them
did
i
not
say
unto
you
go
not
we
can
time
to
the
absence
of
our
friend
if
his
death
was
sudden
or
if
it
took
place
away
from
home
or
during
our
absence
we
expect
to
see
him
again
if
a
vehicle
stops
at
the
door
the
heart
beats
with
an
instantaneous
hope
which
dies
with
its
first
breath
bringing
over
us
a
deeper
and
stronger
refluence
of
sorrow
we
catch
a
sight
of
articles
familiarly
used
by
a
departed
friend
they
are
identified
with
little
passages
in
his
history
or
with
his
daily
life
is
it
possible
that
he
is
altogether
and
forever
disconnected
from
them
they
are
the
same
those
perishable
things
those
comparatively
worthless
things
having
no
value
at
all
except
as
his
use
of
them
made
them
precious
retain
their
shapes
and
places
but
where
is
he
and
must
not
he
return
and
abide
like
them
no
he
is
gone
to
heaven
the
places
which
knew
him
shall
know
him
no
more
forever
those
things
which
have
an
imperishable
value
in
like
the
leaves
of
a
past
autumn
to
a
tree
now
filled
with
blossoms
the
mention
of
every
valued
possession
once
indescribably
dear
to
him
would
awaken
but
slight
emotions
even
the
recent
history
of
the
dwelling
which
he
built
and
furnished
would
be
no
more
to
him
than
the
rehearsal
to
a
grown
person
of
that
which
had
happened
to
a
block
house
or
card
figure
which
amused
his
childhood
we
walk
and
sit
in
the
places
identified
with
our
last
remembrances
of
the
departed
but
he
is
not
there
we
hallow
the
anniversaries
of
his
birth
and
death
but
he
gives
us
no
recognition
we
read
his
letters
they
make
him
seem
alive
his
voice
his
smile
his
love
are
there
and
when
we
have
of
suspicious
scrutiny
whenever
he
produced
the
awful
signature
of
the
protector
but
when
he
ceased
to
meet
the
military
and
other
partisans
of
ruffleton
in
the
less
frequented
lines
of
travel
the
secret
sign
of
the
patriots
availed
him
most
nor
was
it
long
before
he
discovered
to
his
great
joy
that
even
in
new
england
a
majority
of
the
population
had
become
inimical
to
the
designs
of
those
who
now
usurped
the
direction
of
public
affairs
in
the
north
still
the
work
of
the
despot
had
been
too
effectually
done
for
resistance
and
it
was
necessary
for
arms
public
and
private
were
in
the
hands
of
the
protector
s
partisans
and
there
was
a
military
organization
in
every
county
ordered
and
paid
by
the
convention
and
now
the
three
the
most
terrible
tribunal
ever
created
had
its
ramifications
in
every
neighborhood
and
its
instrument
of
death
in
every
town
of
any
magnitude
at
boston
garrott
phipps
and
palter
were
the
three
they
had
returned
from
the
liberian
voyage
breathing
vengeance
against
their
enemies
the
first
victims
were
the
catholics
and
not
satisfied
with
cutting
off
their
heads
the
awful
tribunal
stretched
its
authority
even
to
the
tearing
down
of
the
churches
willy
lingered
several
days
in
the
city
for
there
were
many
patriots
there
who
sighed
for
the
restoration
of
the
union
and
re
establishment
of
the
federal
authority
but
they
had
to
conceal
their
sentiments
the
prosecutor
before
the
tribunal
of
three
was
a
lawyer
in
desperate
circumstances
but
who
subsequently
became
affluent
he
was
accessible
to
the
bribes
of
the
guilty
and
his
the
terrors
of
the
guillotine
were
successfully
wielded
against
the
rich
in
the
exaction
of
large
sums
of
money
and
the
poor
rather
than
die
enrolled
themselves
in
the
army
it
was
not
deemed
necessary
for
the
members
of
the
terrible
tribunal
of
three
to
be
versed
in
the
law
and
perhaps
half
the
judges
in
the
new
england
states
had
not
been
lawyers
but
they
were
very
frequently
parsons
of
the
dissenting
sects
famous
for
their
abolition
propensities
and
admirably
qualified
to
try
and
execute
the
catholics
and
episcopalians
during
the
sojourn
of
willy
in
boston
a
catholic
bishop
was
condemned
to
die
the
charge
against
him
was
that
he
had
enjoined
upon
his
clergy
the
duty
of
abstaining
from
participation
in
discussions
on
the
subject
of
slavery
the
prelate
admitted
without
hesitation
that
he
delivered
such
a
charge
but
pleaded
in
justification
that
both
himself
and
clergy
had
taken
solemn
vows
to
devote
themselves
exclusively
to
the
service
of
their
god
such
a
reply
confused
momentarily
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
court
in
of
serving
one
s
god
exclusively
had
been
omitted
nevertheless
the
prelate
had
been
marked
for
destruction
and
upon
being
questioned
as
to
his
fellowship
with
southern
slave
owners
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
fraternized
with
all
pious
catholics
in
the
southern
as
well
as
in
the
northern
states
and
that
the
tenure
by
which
they
held
their
man
servants
or
their
maid
servants
was
never
made
the
subject
of
investigation
this
too
might
have
confounded
his
accusers
if
he
had
been
content
to
stop
there
but
he
added
a
quotation
from
scripture
viz
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbor
s
wife
nor
his
servant
nor
his
maid
nor
his
ox
nor
his
ass
etc
and
this
was
construed
both
as
a
personal
affront
for
the
three
had
all
been
notorious
servant
stealers
and
a
confession
of
the
crime
of
justifying
slavery
he
was
therefore
sentenced
to
be
decapitated
when
returning
from
the
scene
of
his
execution
willy
felt
the
weight
of
some
one
s
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
swarthy
features
of
phipps
one
of
the
three
what
are
you
doing
here
young
man
he
asked
i
i
am
on
business
for
the
the
he
paused
having
almost
divulged
the
secret
of
his
mission
before
recovering
his
wits
business
for
whom
whose
business
that
s
willy
s
business
and
none
of
yours
replied
he
fortified
with
the
recollection
that
he
bore
none
of
the
circulars
or
other
documents
about
his
person
i
saw
you
in
maryland
with
general
crook
said
phipps
and
that
is
prim
facie
evidence
of
your
guilt
the
court
is
about
to
assemble
again
withhold
your
reply
to
my
question
if
you
see
proper
you
are
not
bound
to
criminate
yourself
saying
this
phipps
strode
on
while
two
of
the
secret
officers
of
the
inquisition
who
seemed
to
have
been
standing
near
in
readiness
seized
willy
and
dragged
him
along
unmindful
of
his
protestations
of
innocence
the
protector
himself
arriving
before
the
three
willy
gazed
at
the
accuser
and
the
judges
with
an
indifferent
calmness
which
only
seemed
to
increase
their
thirst
for
his
blood
the
prosecutor
recapitulated
all
that
phipps
had
alleged
and
then
willy
was
called
upon
to
answer
the
charges
of
identification
with
the
slave
driving
enemy
and
of
being
a
spy
willy
stood
up
and
very
deliberately
unfolding
the
passport
read
it
aloud
to
the
court
for
more
than
a
minute
a
profound
silence
ensued
will
you
allow
me
mr
wire
at
length
said
the
prosecutor
to
look
at
that
remarkable
document
certainly
sir
said
willy
imitating
the
attorney
s
politeness
the
attorney
having
satisfied
himself
of
the
authenticity
of
the
signature
handed
the
passport
to
the
judges
when
both
the
signature
and
the
lines
to
which
it
was
appended
were
recognised
the
passport
was
returned
to
willy
its
validity
was
not
only
acknowledged
but
its
bearer
was
invited
to
dinner
an
of
his
mission
and
hastened
from
point
to
point
making
a
faithful
distribution
of
the
secret
circulars
at
hartford
they
were
just
putting
up
the
guillotine
amidst
a
crowd
of
men
and
boys
the
women
always
appearing
on
the
scene
when
blood
was
to
flow
but
willy
was
astonished
to
meet
a
familiar
face
on
the
ground
superintending
the
erection
of
the
engine
of
death
this
was
mr
rook
formerly
an
agent
of
the
post
office
department
and
in
of
disgrace
imprisonment
or
death
he
had
so
much
to
be
thankful
for
he
had
wronged
nobody
nobody
was
likely
to
suffer
on
his
account
and
as
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
his
nephew
charles
knew
all
the
circumstances
and
would
be
able
when
he
got
back
not
only
to
clear
him
but
his
father
and
fasten
the
guilt
upon
herbert
co
had
he
not
abundant
reason
for
thankfulness
at
any
rate
he
seemed
to
entertain
that
opinion
and
i
must
confess
that
i
encouraged
him
in
it
and
when
he
knelt
by
my
bed
and
poured
out
his
whole
heart
in
thanksgiving
and
praise
and
supplication
i
do
verily
believe
that
i
me
to
ask
you
sir
said
the
judge
in
a
mild
low
voice
if
you
showed
the
letter
to
him
which
you
had
received
with
the
list
from
his
brother
maynard
no
not
at
the
time
i
have
mentioned
did
you
communicate
the
substance
nothing
more
than
i
have
stated
and
why
not
i
was
too
ill
for
business
and
hoping
that
no
mischief
would
follow
i
desired
to
wait
until
i
could
see
the
nephew
face
to
face
what
nephew
sir
demanded
the
prosecutor
the
nephew
you
have
had
for
a
witness
here
charles
parry
i
may
add
perhaps
that
finding
him
well
acquainted
with
all
the
circumstances
and
with
the
names
of
the
parties
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
communicate
beyond
what
has
been
offered
in
the
shape
of
an
admission
by
my
departed
friend
harper
maynard
which
might
be
better
proved
by
a
living
witness
not
be
so
painful
to
the
dear
children
or
to
the
widow
faltering
and
turning
away
the
judge
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
the
jury
were
greatly
moved
a
low
murmur
was
heard
with
labored
breathing
and
hysterical
sobbing
afar
off
and
the
countenance
of
the
prosecutor
changed
though
greatly
disappointed
and
perhaps
a
little
mortified
he
did
not
appear
vexed
nor
very
much
dissatisfied
it
was
evident
moreover
that
his
opinion
of
the
case
had
been
gradually
changing
and
that
his
natural
kindness
of
heart
and
manliness
of
temper
were
beginning
to
overtop
his
professional
instincts
and
that
as
he
looked
around
over
the
anxious
eager
eyes
of
the
witnesses
he
began
to
be
more
and
more
reconciled
at
every
step
in
the
case
to
what
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
at
first
nor
to
speak
of
with
any
patience
while
acquainted
with
but
one
side
of
the
story
an
acquittal
brother
fay
brief
sharp
struggle
with
himself
leaning
over
the
table
and
speaking
in
a
low
earnest
voice
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
on
what
i
foresee
must
be
the
result
judging
by
the
looks
of
the
jury
and
the
judge
and
i
congratulate
your
client
also
and
beg
of
you
to
bring
me
acquainted
with
him
after
the
verdict
is
rendered
for
although
between
ourselves
i
do
nt
much
like
the
law
of
the
case
glancing
at
the
bench
as
laid
down
by
you
and
taken
for
granted
by
the
court
and
have
no
serious
doubt
i
assure
you
that
my
leading
objections
would
be
sustained
upon
appeal
and
that
much
of
the
evidence
ruled
in
ought
to
have
been
ruled
out
as
being
between
other
parties
yet
as
we
seem
to
have
reached
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
at
last
though
in
a
roundabout
way
and
the
major
has
proved
himself
to
be
a
magnanimous
procedure
and
now
ask
you
plainly
what
you
desire
to
do
with
the
case
thank
you
let
the
jury
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
under
your
direction
without
leaving
their
seats
or
shall
we
enter
a
nol
pros
we
should
prefer
a
verdict
well
gentlemen
said
the
judge
seeing
them
withdraw
and
straighten
themselves
up
after
their
consultation
have
you
come
to
a
proper
understanding
we
have
your
honor
and
if
the
court
is
satisfied
we
pray
that
the
jury
may
be
instructed
that
if
they
believe
the
witnesses
for
the
defence
and
the
letter
to
be
what
it
purports
to
be
they
are
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
a
deathlike
stillness
followed
the
judge
hesitated
a
minute
or
two
and
then
whispering
with
the
prosecutor
and
with
mr
fay
a
pleasant
change
passed
over
his
fine
countenance
a
benevolent
smile
gathered
about
his
mouth
and
he
approbation
followed
which
grew
louder
and
louder
till
rebuked
by
the
judge
with
a
rap
on
the
desk
and
by
the
sheriff
with
a
cry
of
silence
there
silence
in
court
but
when
the
jury
had
consulted
together
and
they
all
stood
up
and
their
names
were
called
over
and
they
were
asked
if
they
had
agreed
upon
their
verdict
and
the
foreman
answered
yes
and
then
the
clerk
said
to
them
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
say
you
is
george
a
pendleton
guilty
or
not
guilty
as
charged
in
the
indictment
there
was
something
awful
and
portentous
in
the
stillness
that
followed
not
guilty
said
the
foreman
not
guilty
you
say
mr
foreman
and
so
you
say
all
hearken
to
your
verdict
as
the
court
records
it
and
but
here
the
long
suppressed
feeling
of
the
crowd
broke
forth
in
a
spontaneous
cheer
followed
by
the
sound
of
weeping
there
was
a
great
bustle
and
stir
among
the
witnesses
which
notwithstanding
the
very
serious
countenance
of
the
judge
as
he
rapped
the
desk
and
the
officers
of
the
court
shouted
silence
there
silence
continued
for
several
minutes
the
prisoner
was
forthwith
discharged
and
the
prosecutor
came
up
to
him
and
congratulated
him
offering
his
hand
at
the
same
time
which
was
taken
with
great
thankfulness
and
the
bar
rose
almost
in
a
body
as
if
startled
in
their
sleep
with
a
sudden
burst
of
sunshine
or
the
chirping
of
little
birds
among
apple
blossoms
and
scores
of
well
dressed
middle
aged
men
who
but
the
day
before
had
refused
to
know
the
messmates
again
he
said
and
if
we
are
destined
to
remain
long
in
this
island
we
will
at
least
help
each
other
and
bear
our
hard
lot
together
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
the
beach
and
the
huge
huggermugger
groping
in
the
wet
sand
for
his
shell
fish
if
i
can
but
reach
my
companions
without
being
seen
tell
them
my
strange
adventures
and
all
hide
ourselves
till
the
giant
is
out
of
reach
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
very
soon
he
saw
the
group
of
beautiful
great
shells
just
as
they
were
when
he
left
them
except
that
his
shell
of
course
was
not
there
as
it
graced
mrs
huggermugger
s
domestic
fireside
when
he
came
near
enough
he
called
some
of
his
comrades
by
name
not
too
loud
for
fear
of
being
heard
by
the
shell
fish
loving
giant
they
knew
his
voice
and
one
after
another
the
giant
as
they
were
out
looking
for
their
lost
companion
and
had
fled
to
hide
themselves
in
their
shells
for
heaven
s
sake
cried
the
little
sailor
tom
charley
all
of
you
do
nt
stay
here
the
giant
will
come
and
carry
you
all
off
to
his
house
under
the
cliffs
his
wife
has
a
particular
liking
for
those
beautiful
houses
of
yours
i
have
just
escaped
almost
by
miracle
come
come
with
me
here
under
the
rocks
in
this
cave
quick
before
he
sees
us
so
little
jacket
hurried
his
friends
into
a
hole
in
the
rocks
where
the
giant
would
never
think
of
prying
huggermugger
did
not
see
them
they
were
safe
as
soon
as
he
had
filled
his
basket
he
went
off
and
left
nothing
but
his
footprints
and
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
behind
him
after
all
i
do
nt
think
the
giant
would
have
hurt
them
had
he
seen
them
for
he
would
have
known
the
difference
between
a
doubt
too
good
natured
to
injure
them
if
they
made
it
clear
to
his
mind
that
they
were
not
by
any
means
fish
but
on
the
contrary
might
disagree
dreadfully
with
his
digestion
should
he
attempt
to
swallow
them
chapter
eight
how
little
jacket
and
his
friends
left
the
giant
s
island
very
soon
the
sailors
found
a
nice
large
dry
cave
in
the
rocks
there
they
brought
dry
sea
weed
and
made
it
into
beds
and
lived
on
the
fish
and
fruits
which
they
had
not
much
difficulty
in
obtaining
they
even
dragged
their
beautiful
shells
into
the
cave
and
made
little
closets
and
cupboards
of
them
their
cups
and
plates
were
made
of
smaller
bivalve
shells
their
drink
was
clear
spring
water
which
they
discovered
near
by
mixed
with
the
juice
of
fruits
they
lived
in
this
way
for
several
weeks
always
hoping
some
good
luck
would
happen
at
last
one
day
they
saw
a
ship
a
few
miles
from
the
shore
they
all
ran
to
the
hats
soon
to
their
indescribable
joy
they
saw
a
boat
approaching
the
shore
they
did
not
wait
for
it
to
reach
the
land
but
being
all
good
swimmers
with
one
accord
plunged
into
the
sea
and
swam
to
the
boat
the
sailors
in
the
boat
proved
to
be
all
americans
and
the
ship
was
the
nancy
johnson
from
portsmouth
n
h
bound
to
the
east
indies
but
being
out
of
water
had
made
for
land
to
obtain
a
supply
the
poor
fellows
were
glad
enough
to
get
on
board
ship
again
as
they
sailed
off
they
fancied
they
saw
in
the
twilight
the
huge
forms
of
the
great
mr
and
mrs
huggermugger
on
the
rocks
gazing
after
them
with
open
eyes
and
mouths
they
pointed
them
out
to
the
people
of
the
ship
as
little
jacket
related
his
wonderful
adventures
but
the
sailors
only
laughed
at
them
and
saw
nothing
but
huge
rocks
and
trees
and
they
whispered
among
themselves
that
the
poor
fellows
had
lived
too
long
and
that
a
little
jolly
life
on
board
ship
would
soon
cure
their
disordered
imaginations
chapter
nine
mr
nabbum
little
jacket
and
his
friends
were
treated
very
kindly
by
the
captain
and
crew
of
the
nancy
johnson
and
as
a
few
more
sailors
were
wanted
on
board
their
services
were
gladly
accepted
they
all
arrived
safely
at
java
where
the
ship
took
in
a
cargo
of
coffee
little
jacket
often
related
his
adventures
in
the
giant
s
island
but
the
sailors
though
many
of
them
were
inclined
to
believe
in
marvellous
stories
evidently
did
not
give
much
credit
to
jacky
s
strange
tale
but
thought
he
must
have
dreamed
it
all
there
was
however
one
man
who
came
frequently
on
board
the
ship
while
at
java
who
seemed
not
altogether
incredulous
he
was
a
tall
powerful
yankee
who
went
by
the
name
of
zebedee
nabbum
he
had
been
employed
as
an
agent
of
barnum
to
sail
to
the
indies
and
other
countries
in
search
of
elephants
rhinoceroses
animals
he
might
chance
to
ensnare
he
had
been
fitted
out
with
a
large
ship
and
crew
and
all
the
men
and
implements
necessary
for
this
exciting
and
dangerous
task
and
had
been
successful
in
entrapping
two
young
elephants
a
giraffe
a
lion
sixteen
monkeys
and
a
great
number
of
parrots
he
was
now
at
java
superintending
the
manufacture
of
a
very
powerful
net
of
grass
ropes
an
invention
of
his
own
with
which
he
hoped
to
catch
a
good
many
more
wild
animals
and
return
to
america
and
make
his
fortune
by
exhibiting
them
for
mr
barnum
now
zebedee
nabbum
listened
with
profound
attention
to
little
jacket
s
story
and
pondered
and
pondered
over
it
illustration
mr
nabbum
hears
little
jacket
s
story
and
after
all
he
said
to
himself
why
should
nt
it
be
true
do
nt
we
read
in
scripter
that
there
war
giants
once
then
why
had
nt
there
ought
to
be
some
on
em
left
in
some
of
them
remote
islands
whar
true
if
we
should
find
jacky
s
island
if
we
should
see
we
will
go
it
while
she
does
hold
together
can
you
swim
tom
you
know
very
well
i
can
swim
paul
better
get
your
boots
off
swim
ashore
in
such
a
sea
as
this
besides
it
is
over
a
half
a
mile
and
the
surf
on
the
beach
would
tear
a
fellow
all
to
pieces
you
ought
to
have
thought
of
these
things
before
you
came
out
here
it
is
a
great
deal
worse
than
i
had
any
idea
of
answered
thomas
who
had
proceeded
far
enough
to
be
willing
to
yield
a
point
for
my
part
i
am
willing
to
be
landed
here
and
he
pointed
to
a
little
cove
on
the
tenean
shore
you
do
nt
say
you
have
got
enough
of
it
tom
said
paul
with
a
smile
enough
of
it
i
want
to
get
to
the
picnic
some
time
to
day
i
hope
you
do
nt
think
i
am
frightened
of
course
i
do
nt
you
dares
nt
be
frightened
after
all
your
big
talk
before
we
came
out
i
ll
give
up
on
that
paul
you
are
i
am
willing
to
say
that
and
stick
to
it
that
s
saying
a
good
deal
but
you
must
nt
suppose
i
am
afraid
of
course
not
you
re
only
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
the
picnic
that
s
the
idea
that
s
just
it
and
if
you
will
put
me
ashore
at
the
cove
i
will
be
just
as
much
obliged
to
you
as
though
you
carried
me
all
the
way
to
the
point
let
s
not
back
out
tom
i
do
nt
back
out
and
i
m
sure
you
do
nt
it
looks
a
little
like
backing
out
to
give
up
the
chase
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
if
i
am
i
sha
nt
be
satisfied
till
i
land
you
at
the
point
come
come
paul
do
nt
carry
the
joke
too
far
the
sea
is
getting
heavier
and
heavier
and
the
wind
blows
a
young
really
want
to
back
out
i
m
willing
i
do
nt
want
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
if
you
think
i
ca
nt
stand
it
as
long
as
you
can
you
are
mistaken
replied
thomas
proudly
and
taking
the
dipper
he
continued
to
bale
out
the
water
whistling
an
air
to
indicate
his
indifference
to
the
perils
that
surrounded
them
put
her
through
then
we
sha
nt
be
much
longer
if
we
do
nt
get
swamped
the
boat
was
now
standing
out
from
the
shore
and
while
thomas
was
still
busy
whistling
off
his
fears
a
violent
gust
of
wind
struck
the
sail
causing
the
boat
to
heel
over
so
far
that
she
drank
up
several
buckets
of
water
and
would
have
filled
if
the
sprit
had
not
broken
thus
removing
the
pressure
come
paul
i
have
got
enough
of
this
cried
thomas
uneasily
i
do
nt
think
you
will
be
able
to
get
any
more
of
ca
nt
carry
sail
any
longer
replied
paul
apparently
unmoved
by
the
accident
bale
her
out
as
fast
as
you
can
and
i
will
take
an
oar
and
keep
her
head
up
to
the
sea
what
will
you
do
now
asked
thomas
whose
courage
was
sorely
tried
by
the
perilous
situation
of
the
boat
get
the
water
out
and
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
answered
paul
who
though
he
had
already
decided
this
important
question
would
not
permit
his
passenger
to
enter
into
his
counsels
preferring
to
tantalize
him
by
his
mysterious
manner
let
us
get
ashore
paul
as
soon
as
possible
going
to
back
out
no
what
s
the
use
of
talking
in
that
way
about
backing
out
when
you
ca
nt
carry
sail
replied
thomas
whose
pride
was
still
unconquered
though
his
courage
was
rapidly
failing
him
i
shall
rig
a
new
sprit
there
s
it
is
just
the
right
length
i
ll
give
up
then
and
back
out
said
thomas
despairing
of
any
relief
from
the
misfortunes
that
had
befallen
the
boat
do
nt
back
out
on
my
account
i
will
put
you
ashore
at
the
point
if
you
say
the
word
replied
paul
satisfied
now
that
he
had
kept
his
promise
and
given
his
friend
enough
of
it
run
for
the
shore
paul
just
as
you
say
and
the
boatman
proud
of
the
triumph
he
had
won
over
his
boastful
companion
turned
the
boat
s
head
towards
the
shore
the
corner
of
the
sail
hung
down
for
the
want
of
a
sprit
to
support
it
but
as
they
had
the
wind
free
there
was
canvas
enough
to
drive
her
rapidly
towards
the
shore
while
they
were
still
half
a
mile
from
the
cove
thomas
called
paul
s
attention
to
a
horse
and
chaise
on
the
beach
from
which
a
man
was
making
violent
paul
hears
bad
news
who
is
it
tom
asked
paul
very
anxiously
i
do
nt
know
ca
nt
make
him
out
what
can
he
want
with
us
perhaps
your
mother
has
sent
him
after
her
runaway
boy
but
whoever
he
is
i
will
tell
him
you
are
a
fellow
of
the
right
spunk
who
can
it
be
what
matter
who
it
is
your
mother
wo
nt
whip
you
will
she
no
of
course
not
my
mother
do
nt
whip
me
i
thought
she
did
you
seem
so
much
afraid
of
her
i
am
not
afraid
of
her
if
you
are
there
is
nothing
else
that
can
frighten
you
i
mind
my
mother
because
she
is
my
mother
because
i
like
to
do
so
and
not
because
i
am
afraid
of
her
you
had
better
not
say
much
more
about
being
afraid
tom
said
thomas
smartly
if
you
was
nt
afraid
you
was
confoundedly
scared
replied
paul
whose
paradox
was
fully
appreciated
by
his
companion
look
here
paul
are
you
going
to
tell
the
fellows
that
i
was
scared
demanded
thomas
rather
in
a
beseeching
than
an
intimidating
tone
that
will
depend
on
circumstances
what
circumstances
you
may
as
well
understand
me
first
horror
and
my
eyes
bade
you
do
it
repeated
she
they
both
leaned
over
the
parapet
and
gazed
downward
as
earnestly
as
if
some
inestimable
treasure
had
fallen
over
and
were
yet
recoverable
on
the
pavement
below
was
a
dark
mass
lying
in
a
heap
with
little
or
nothing
human
in
its
appearance
except
that
the
hands
were
stretched
out
as
if
they
might
have
clutched
for
a
moment
at
the
small
square
stones
but
there
was
no
motion
in
them
now
miriam
watched
the
heap
of
mortality
while
she
could
count
a
hundred
which
she
took
pains
to
do
no
stir
not
a
finger
moved
you
have
killed
him
donatello
he
is
quite
dead
said
she
stone
dead
would
i
were
so
too
sternly
asked
donatello
still
in
the
glow
of
that
intelligence
which
passion
had
developed
in
him
there
was
short
time
to
weigh
the
matter
but
he
had
his
trial
in
that
breath
or
two
while
i
held
him
over
the
cliff
and
his
sentence
in
that
one
glance
when
your
eyes
responded
to
mine
say
that
i
have
slain
him
against
your
will
say
that
he
died
without
your
whole
consent
and
in
another
breath
you
shall
see
me
lying
beside
him
o
never
cried
miriam
my
one
own
friend
never
never
never
she
turned
to
him
the
guilty
bloodstained
lonely
woman
she
turned
to
her
fellow
criminal
the
youth
so
lately
innocent
whom
she
had
drawn
into
her
doom
she
pressed
him
close
close
to
her
bosom
with
a
clinging
embrace
that
brought
their
two
hearts
together
till
the
horror
and
agony
of
each
was
combined
into
one
emotion
and
that
a
speak
the
truth
said
she
my
heart
consented
to
what
you
did
we
two
slew
yonder
wretch
the
deed
knots
us
together
for
time
and
eternity
like
the
coil
of
a
serpent
they
threw
one
other
glance
at
the
heap
of
death
below
to
assure
themselves
that
it
was
there
so
like
a
dream
was
the
whole
thing
then
they
turned
from
that
fatal
precipice
and
came
out
of
the
courtyard
arm
in
arm
heart
in
heart
instinctively
they
were
heedful
not
to
sever
themselves
so
much
as
a
pace
or
two
from
one
another
for
fear
of
the
terror
and
deadly
chill
that
would
thenceforth
wait
for
them
in
solitude
their
deed
the
crime
which
donatello
wrought
and
miriam
accepted
on
the
instant
had
wreathed
itself
as
she
said
like
a
serpent
in
inextricable
links
about
both
their
souls
and
drew
them
into
one
by
its
terrible
contractile
power
it
was
closer
than
a
marriage
bond
so
intimate
in
those
first
moments
new
sympathy
annihilated
all
other
ties
and
that
they
were
released
from
the
chain
of
humanity
a
new
sphere
a
special
law
had
been
created
for
them
alone
the
world
could
not
come
near
them
they
were
safe
when
they
reached
the
flight
of
steps
leading
downward
from
the
capitol
there
was
a
faroff
noise
of
singing
and
laughter
swift
indeed
had
been
the
rush
of
the
crisis
that
was
come
and
gone
this
was
still
the
merriment
of
the
party
that
had
so
recently
been
their
companions
they
recognized
the
voices
which
a
little
while
ago
had
accorded
and
sung
in
cadence
with
their
own
but
they
were
familiar
voices
no
more
they
sounded
strangely
and
as
it
were
out
of
the
depths
of
space
so
remote
was
all
that
pertained
to
the
past
life
of
these
guilty
ones
in
the
moral
seclusion
that
had
suddenly
extended
itself
around
them
but
how
close
and
ever
closer
did
the
breath
of
the
immeasurable
waste
that
press
them
one
within
the
other
o
friend
cried
miriam
so
putting
her
soul
into
the
word
that
it
took
a
heavy
richness
of
meaning
and
seemed
never
to
have
been
spoken
before
o
friend
are
you
conscious
as
i
am
of
this
companionship
that
knits
our
heart
strings
together
i
feel
it
miriam
said
donatello
we
draw
one
breath
we
live
one
life
only
yesterday
continued
miriam
nay
only
a
short
half
hour
ago
i
shivered
in
an
icy
solitude
no
friendship
no
sisterhood
could
come
near
enough
to
keep
the
warmth
within
my
heart
in
an
instant
all
is
changed
there
can
be
no
more
loneliness
none
miriam
said
donatello
none
my
beautiful
one
responded
miriam
gazing
in
his
face
which
had
taken
a
higher
almost
an
heroic
aspect
from
the
strength
of
passion
none
my
innocent
one
one
wretched
and
worthless
life
has
been
sacrificed
to
cement
two
other
lives
for
evermore
for
evermore
miriam
said
donatello
cemented
with
his
blood
the
young
man
started
at
the
word
which
he
had
himself
spoken
it
may
be
that
it
brought
home
to
the
simplicity
of
his
imagination
what
he
had
not
before
dreamed
of
the
ever
increasing
loathsomeness
of
a
union
that
consists
in
guilt
cemented
with
blood
which
would
corrupt
and
grow
more
noisome
forever
and
forever
but
bind
them
none
the
less
strictly
for
that
forget
it
cast
it
all
behind
you
said
miriam
detecting
by
her
sympathy
the
pang
that
was
in
his
heart
the
deed
has
done
its
office
and
has
no
existence
any
more
they
flung
the
past
behind
them
as
she
counselled
or
else
distilled
from
it
a
fiery
intoxication
which
sufficed
to
carry
them
triumphantly
through
those
first
moments
of
their
doom
for
guilt
has
its
moment
law
is
ever
an
ecstatic
sense
of
freedom
and
thus
there
exhaled
upward
out
of
their
dark
sympathy
at
the
base
of
which
lay
a
human
corpse
a
bliss
or
an
insanity
which
the
unhappy
pair
imagined
to
be
well
worth
the
sleepy
innocence
that
was
forever
lost
to
them
as
their
spirits
rose
to
the
solemn
madness
of
the
occasion
they
went
onward
not
stealthily
not
fearfully
but
with
a
stately
gait
and
aspect
passion
lent
them
as
it
does
to
meaner
shapes
its
brief
nobility
of
carriage
they
trod
through
the
streets
of
rome
as
if
they
but
the
incident
of
the
confessional
if
known
as
probably
it
was
to
the
eager
propagandists
who
prowl
about
for
souls
as
cats
to
catch
a
mouse
would
surely
inspire
the
most
confident
expectations
of
bringing
her
over
to
the
faith
with
so
pious
an
end
in
view
would
jesuitical
morality
be
shocked
at
the
thought
of
kidnapping
the
mortal
body
for
the
sake
of
the
immortal
spirit
that
might
otherwise
be
lost
forever
would
to
be
infinitely
the
kindest
service
that
he
could
perform
for
the
stray
lamb
who
had
so
strangely
sought
his
aid
if
these
suppositions
were
well
founded
hilda
was
most
likely
a
prisoner
in
one
of
the
religious
establishments
that
are
so
numerous
in
rome
the
idea
according
to
the
aspect
in
which
it
was
viewed
brought
now
a
degree
of
comfort
and
now
an
additional
perplexity
on
the
one
hand
hilda
was
safe
from
any
but
spiritual
assaults
on
the
other
where
was
the
possibility
of
breaking
through
all
those
barred
portals
and
searching
a
thousand
convent
cells
to
set
her
free
kenyon
however
as
it
happened
was
prevented
from
endeavoring
to
follow
out
this
surmise
which
only
the
state
of
hopeless
uncertainty
that
almost
bewildered
his
reason
could
have
led
him
for
a
moment
to
entertain
a
communication
reached
him
by
an
unknown
hand
in
consequence
of
which
and
within
an
hour
after
receiving
it
he
took
his
way
through
one
of
the
gates
of
was
a
bright
forenoon
of
february
a
month
in
which
the
brief
severity
of
a
roman
winter
is
already
past
and
when
violets
and
daisies
begin
to
show
themselves
in
spots
favored
by
the
sun
the
sculptor
came
out
of
the
city
by
the
gate
of
san
sebastiano
and
walked
briskly
along
the
appian
way
for
the
space
of
a
mile
or
two
beyond
the
gate
this
ancient
and
famous
road
is
as
desolate
and
disagreeable
as
most
of
the
other
roman
avenues
it
extends
over
small
uncomfortable
paving
stones
between
brick
and
plastered
walls
which
are
very
solidly
constructed
and
so
high
as
almost
to
exclude
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
the
houses
are
of
most
uninviting
aspect
neither
picturesque
nor
homelike
and
social
they
have
seldom
or
never
a
door
opening
on
the
wayside
but
are
accessible
only
from
the
rear
and
frown
inhospitably
upon
the
traveller
through
iron
grated
windows
here
and
there
appears
a
dreary
inn
or
a
wine
shop
designated
by
the
withered
bush
beside
the
entrance
within
guests
refresh
themselves
with
sour
bread
and
goats
milk
cheese
washed
down
with
wine
of
dolorous
acerbity
at
frequent
intervals
along
the
roadside
up
rises
the
ruin
of
an
ancient
tomb
as
they
stand
now
these
structures
are
immensely
high
and
broken
mounds
of
conglomerated
brick
stone
pebbles
and
earth
all
molten
by
time
into
a
mass
as
solid
and
indestructible
as
if
each
tomb
were
composed
of
a
single
boulder
of
granite
when
first
erected
they
were
cased
externally
no
doubt
with
slabs
of
polished
marble
artfully
wrought
bas
reliefs
and
all
such
suitable
adornments
and
were
rendered
majestically
beautiful
by
grand
architectural
designs
this
antique
splendor
has
long
since
been
stolen
from
the
dead
to
decorate
the
palaces
and
churches
of
the
living
nothing
remains
to
the
dishonored
sepulchres
except
their
massiveness
even
the
pyramids
form
hardly
a
stranger
spectacle
or
are
more
alien
from
human
sympathies
than
the
tombs
of
the
appian
way
with
their
gigantic
height
breadth
and
solidity
defying
time
and
by
an
ordinary
earthquake
here
you
may
see
a
modern
dwelling
and
a
garden
with
its
vines
and
olive
trees
perched
on
the
lofty
dilapidation
of
a
tomb
which
forms
a
precipice
of
fifty
feet
in
depth
on
each
of
the
four
sides
there
is
a
home
on
that
funereal
mound
where
generations
of
children
have
been
born
and
successive
lives
been
spent
undisturbed
by
the
ghost
of
the
stern
roman
whose
ashes
were
so
preposterously
burdened
other
sepulchres
wear
a
crown
of
grass
shrubbery
and
forest
trees
which
throw
out
a
broad
sweep
of
branches
having
had
time
twice
over
to
be
a
thousand
years
of
age
on
one
of
them
stands
a
tower
which
though
immemorially
more
modern
than
the
tomb
was
itself
built
by
immemorial
hands
and
is
now
rifted
quite
from
top
to
bottom
by
a
vast
fissure
of
decay
the
tomb
hillock
its
foundation
being
still
as
firm
as
ever
and
likely
to
endure
until
the
last
trump
shall
rend
it
wide
asunder
and
dead
for
except
in
one
or
two
doubtful
instances
these
mountainous
sepulchral
edifices
have
not
availed
to
keep
so
much
as
the
bare
name
of
an
individual
or
a
family
from
oblivion
ambitious
of
everlasting
remembrance
as
they
were
the
slumberers
might
just
as
well
have
gone
quietly
to
rest
each
in
his
pigeon
hole
of
a
columbarium
or
under
his
little
green
hillock
in
a
graveyard
without
a
headstone
to
mark
the
spot
it
is
rather
satisfactory
than
otherwise
to
think
that
all
these
idle
pains
have
turned
out
so
utterly
abortive
about
two
miles
or
more
from
the
city
gate
and
right
upon
the
roadside
kenyon
passed
an
immense
round
pile
sepulchral
in
its
original
purposes
like
those
already
mentioned
it
was
built
of
great
blocks
of
hewn
stone
on
a
vast
square
foundation
of
rough
agglomerated
material
such
as
composes
the
mass
of
all
the
other
ruinous
tombs
but
whatever
might
be
the
cause
it
was
in
a
far
better
state
of
preservation
than
a
mediaeval
fortress
out
of
the
midst
of
which
so
long
since
had
time
begun
to
crumble
the
supplemental
structure
and
cover
it
with
soil
by
means
of
wayside
dust
grew
trees
bushes
and
thick
festoons
of
ivy
this
tomb
of
a
woman
had
become
the
citadel
and
donjon
keep
of
a
castle
and
all
the
care
that
cecilia
metella
s
husband
could
bestow
to
secure
endless
peace
for
her
beloved
relics
had
only
sufficed
to
make
that
handful
of
precious
ashes
not
ruddock
attends
to
these
things
by
the
way
ruddock
i
see
we
are
out
of
blanks
you
ve
had
to
write
the
whole
of
this
how
long
have
we
been
out
of
blanks
not
long
replied
the
confidential
clerk
i
did
nt
have
to
write
more
than
a
dozen
complete
i
have
plenty
now
do
you
mean
to
be
understood
mr
kilgore
that
you
have
blank
replies
to
such
applications
as
mine
inquired
the
doctor
in
undisguised
astonishment
certainly
sir
said
mr
kilgore
you
see
we
have
an
average
of
three
such
applications
as
yours
a
day
three
hundred
working
days
in
a
year
makes
it
necessary
to
send
nine
hundred
letters
well
we
have
so
much
to
do
that
the
blank
saves
time
s
really
quite
a
matter
of
economy
of
course
then
said
dr
gilbert
you
have
decided
on
my
daughter
s
book
without
giving
it
any
consideration
i
wish
you
to
see
it
and
personally
to
become
acquainted
with
its
merits
the
great
publisher
laughed
mr
ruddock
overheard
the
remark
and
laughed
too
bless
your
soul
sir
said
mr
kilgore
i
never
read
a
book
i
have
nt
time
somebody
reads
i
suppose
continued
the
doctor
and
i
wish
my
daughter
to
have
a
chance
my
literary
man
said
mr
kilgore
would
read
it
if
it
were
of
any
use
but
my
engagements
are
such
that
i
can
not
take
the
book
besides
the
novel
market
is
perfectly
flat
i
think
perhaps
kapp
demigh
might
do
something
for
you
what
class
of
books
does
the
young
man
who
has
just
left
you
produce
fitzgerald
the
most
popular
and
promising
novelist
of
the
day
great
faculty
for
hitting
the
popular
taste
just
in
the
bull
s
eye
just
in
the
bull
s
eye
and
mr
kilgore
rubbed
his
hands
pleasantly
together
and
told
over
a
package
of
letters
as
if
they
were
a
pack
of
cards
i
see
your
engagements
are
not
such
as
to
prevent
you
from
making
a
new
one
with
him
nor
the
novel
market
so
flat
as
to
fail
of
responding
to
him
said
the
doctor
with
a
bitter
tone
mr
kilgore
smiled
mr
ruddock
looked
up
and
smiled
also
you
are
sharp
said
mr
kilgore
you
are
hard
on
me
you
will
allow
me
to
return
the
compliment
and
repeat
the
accusation
responded
the
doctor
rising
angrily
to
his
feet
we
profess
to
understand
our
business
here
said
mr
kilgore
entirely
unruffled
ruddock
and
i
manage
to
get
along
in
our
small
way
responded
the
clerk
with
pleasant
irony
not
stopping
for
a
moment
in
his
work
yes
yes
in
our
small
way
repeated
mr
kilgore
and
then
he
began
to
bustle
about
his
desk
in
a
way
that
said
i
wish
this
old
fellow
would
take
his
leave
why
do
nt
he
go
dr
gilbert
was
not
accustomed
to
being
treated
in
this
way
at
all
and
it
irritated
him
exceedingly
he
turned
lingeringly
toward
the
door
then
hesitated
and
then
said
calmly
mr
kilgore
do
you
think
this
is
treating
my
daughter
fairly
why
bless
your
soul
my
good
friend
exclaimed
mr
kilgore
i
ve
been
treating
you
very
politely
to
save
your
feelings
i
have
told
you
that
my
engagements
are
such
that
i
can
not
take
your
book
and
that
the
novel
market
is
flat
now
if
you
want
the
truth
it
is
that
a
take
hold
of
a
book
that
will
sell
and
that
the
novel
market
is
always
flat
to
new
comers
there
you
have
the
whole
of
it
and
as
you
are
probably
going
the
rounds
here
in
new
york
i
ll
pay
you
something
handsome
if
you
find
a
single
publisher
who
will
give
you
the
real
reason
he
has
for
refusing
your
manuscript
i
thank
you
for
your
present
frankness
at
least
said
the
doctor
well
come
back
and
sit
down
said
mr
kilgore
warmly
as
a
new
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
ruddock
be
kind
enough
to
leave
us
till
i
call
you
sit
down
sir
sit
down
the
confidential
clerk
looked
up
surprised
took
up
some
of
his
papers
and
retired
you
say
said
mr
kilgore
drawing
his
chair
close
to
dr
gilbert
that
this
novel
is
written
by
your
daughter
is
she
an
obedient
daughter
well
replied
the
doctor
strong
will
but
she
is
mainly
obedient
fanny
is
a
good
girl
and
not
without
genius
i
think
d
n
the
genius
is
she
obedient
that
s
the
question
is
she
willing
to
honor
your
judgment
in
every
thing
i
ca
nt
say
that
she
is
in
fact
this
book
of
hers
was
written
against
my
will
and
i
am
only
sorry
at
this
moment
that
i
had
not
enforced
my
wishes
that
s
enough
replied
mr
kilgore
while
his
eye
flashed
angrily
i
would
nt
publish
her
book
if
i
knew
i
should
sell
a
million
copies
of
it
you
are
strangely
excited
said
dr
gilbert
and
you
will
allow
me
to
say
that
you
greatly
exaggerate
my
daughter
s
disposition
to
disobedience
yes
excited
yes
i
ve
seen
something
of
disobedient
daughters
when
your
fanny
snaps
her
fingers
in
your
face
and
raises
the
devil
with
all
your
arrangements
later
you
ll
be
excited
very
strangely
excited
yes
by
the
way
whom
are
you
going
to
now
with
your
book
i
have
kapp
demigh
and
ballou
gold
on
my
note
book
replied
dr
gilbert
good
houses
both
of
them
said
mr
kilgore
but
do
nt
go
beyond
them
or
you
ll
get
into
trouble
at
any
rate
keep
out
of
sargent
s
hands
the
ripest
young
scoundrel
that
ever
wore
a
sanctimonious
face
or
whined
at
a
prayer
meeting
i
know
him
he
used
to
be
a
clerk
of
mine
the
doctor
laid
the
name
of
sargent
carefully
away
in
his
mind
left
the
strangely
acting
publisher
as
soon
as
he
could
and
went
directly
to
the
city
hotel
to
think
over
his
morning
s
adventures
get
some
dinner
our
first
position
as
monsieur
cheffier
the
dancing
master
says
look
there
he
goes
shouted
half
a
score
of
eager
voices
and
the
fox
appeared
in
full
view
to
all
eyes
scampering
out
of
the
thicket
and
taking
a
direction
straight
for
us
ladies
your
whips
lash
him
as
he
passes
shouted
the
colonel
to
us
we
must
turn
him
back
and
not
let
him
get
into
the
wood
or
the
sport
is
up
the
fox
came
gallantly
on
as
if
either
he
did
not
care
for
us
or
did
not
see
us
the
colonel
kept
urging
us
to
whip
at
him
placed
our
horses
right
across
the
only
way
by
which
he
could
reach
the
wood
and
prepared
to
do
battle
bravely
we
being
the
only
persons
on
that
side
of
the
field
the
rest
of
the
party
having
spread
themselves
over
the
field
expecting
the
fox
to
emerge
from
cover
in
a
different
direction
from
that
which
he
took
i
must
confess
i
felt
some
trepidation
as
i
saw
the
fox
which
was
a
large
one
making
as
straight
as
an
arrow
for
my
horse
my
riding
whip
was
not
very
long
but
i
prepared
to
use
it
as
valiantly
as
i
could
he
makes
for
you
miss
kate
do
nt
let
him
pass
under
your
horse
shouted
the
colonel
in
three
leaps
the
fox
was
within
six
feet
of
my
steed
and
was
passing
or
rather
aiming
to
pass
under
him
when
i
hit
him
smartly
with
my
ivory
handled
whip
the
blow
had
the
effect
of
checking
his
leap
so
far
as
to
give
it
another
direction
and
showing
of
teeth
a
dreadful
horrid
scramble
with
sharp
claws
right
up
the
flank
of
my
horse
and
over
my
saddle
a
sweep
of
his
brush
in
my
face
and
he
was
off
upon
the
ground
on
the
other
side
with
my
green
veil
entangled
about
his
head
and
forefeet
we
have
him
you
ve
fought
bravely
miss
kate
he
s
meshed
shouted
several
of
the
gentlemen
was
any
thing
ever
done
handsomer
never
saw
a
bolder
leap
than
that
in
a
fox
the
fox
was
indeed
fairly
meshed
the
veil
blinding
and
fettering
him
so
hard
that
he
did
nothing
but
roll
over
and
over
spit
and
snarl
like
twenty
cats
tied
up
in
a
sack
the
colonel
leaped
from
his
horse
and
approached
him
with
his
whip
the
other
gentlemen
did
the
same
as
fast
as
they
reached
the
spot
the
negroes
yelled
and
laughed
with
obstreperous
joy
at
the
pickle
massa
fox
was
in
but
reynard
was
not
yet
captured
fearfully
that
he
released
one
foot
from
my
poor
torn
veil
and
thus
relieved
in
part
he
managed
by
the
most
extraordinary
somersets
to
travel
at
a
pace
difficult
for
the
gentlemen
to
keep
up
with
laughing
too
as
they
all
were
at
his
perplexity
which
was
comical
enough
the
progress
of
the
fox
was
a
one
legged
lope
a
roll
and
a
somerset
alternately
varied
by
a
yelp
at
every
new
change
in
his
extraordinary
locomotion
he
got
a
dozen
blows
with
the
whips
but
still
marvelously
kept
ahead
of
his
pursuers
till
at
length
he
tumbled
blindly
into
a
deep
hole
out
of
which
a
tree
had
been
taken
when
the
dogs
plunged
in
upon
him
and
strangled
him
the
brush
was
brought
to
me
as
a
trophy
the
gentlemen
declaring
that
i
was
his
captor
i
however
referred
that
honor
to
my
poor
veil
which
was
torn
and
soiled
most
pitiful
to
behold
the
colonel
has
since
that
adventure
fox
kate
letter
ix
my
dear
sir
i
do
not
recollect
whether
in
my
former
letter
i
have
mentioned
the
rural
little
gothic
chapel
which
is
on
the
estate
it
was
erected
at
the
private
expense
of
the
noble
hearted
christian
gentleman
who
is
its
proprietor
the
model
is
borrowed
from
an
exquisite
chapel
which
the
colonel
saw
on
the
estate
of
the
earl
of
c
when
he
was
in
england
the
situation
of
our
chapel
is
romantic
and
being
seen
from
all
parts
of
the
plantation
is
an
interesting
feature
in
the
scenery
it
is
about
fifty
five
feet
long
and
built
of
stone
with
turrets
and
mullioned
gothic
windows
of
stained
glass
and
a
floor
of
tennessee
marble
its
site
is
upon
the
verge
of
a
green
plantation
which
overhangs
the
brook
and
is
in
its
turn
overhung
by
a
projecting
spur
of
the
lion
s
cliff
majestic
oaks
embrace
it
and
ivy
is
trained
up
its
walls
a
broad
lawn
crossed
by
graveled
to
the
villa
one
to
the
next
plantation
and
one
to
the
african
village
where
the
slaves
reside
for
be
it
known
to
you
that
this
beautiful
chapel
the
cost
of
which
was
has
been
built
for
the
slaves
of
the
estate
the
body
of
the
chapel
is
reserved
for
them
while
in
a
gallery
above
the
entrance
are
four
pews
two
on
each
side
of
the
organ
in
which
the
colonel
s
family
and
sometimes
the
families
of
one
or
two
of
the
neighboring
planters
sit
during
service
this
is
performed
every
sabbath
morning
by
a
gray
headed
gentleman
who
acts
as
lay
reader
and
on
week
days
occupies
himself
in
teaching
the
classics
to
two
sons
of
a
gentleman
who
lives
two
miles
off
for
his
services
on
sunday
the
colonel
gives
him
a
salary
the
second
sunday
after
i
came
here
i
was
invited
to
attend
service
in
the
chapel
with
the
family
upon
entering
it
i
found
the
body
of
the
floor
occupied
by
the
black
men
the
utmost
decency
and
quiet
and
all
neatly
and
cleanly
attired
we
took
our
seats
in
the
gallery
while
isabel
placed
herself
at
the
organ
to
play
a
voluntary
until
the
old
gentleman
who
officiated
entered
i
had
time
to
look
at
the
interior
of
this
bijou
of
a
church
on
the
right
of
the
chancel
was
an
exquisite
group
of
statuary
executed
in
italy
expressly
opening
his
eyes
uttered
the
name
of
niniotan
i
am
here
before
you
replied
the
boy
niniotan
be
a
huron
warrior
be
as
oonomoo
has
been
never
take
the
scalp
of
a
foe
and
kill
none
except
in
honorable
warfare
live
and
die
a
christian
as
was
his
custom
when
in
his
own
tongue
so
that
the
missionary
was
the
only
one
beside
them
who
understood
it
languidly
shutting
his
eyes
again
oonomoo
said
read
out
of
good
book
the
good
man
was
pained
beyond
description
to
find
that
the
pocket
bible
which
he
always
carried
with
him
had
been
lost
during
his
hurried
approach
to
this
spot
but
fluellina
who
had
caught
the
words
said
it
is
in
my
bosom
the
missionary
reached
down
and
drew
it
forth
and
as
he
did
so
all
the
men
noticed
the
red
stains
upon
it
while
he
himself
felt
the
warm
fresh
blood
upon
his
hand
instinctively
he
opened
the
volume
at
the
fifteenth
chapter
of
corinthians
that
beautiful
letter
of
the
apostle
s
in
which
the
triumphant
and
glorious
resurrection
of
the
body
at
the
last
day
is
pictured
in
the
sublime
language
of
inspiration
as
is
the
earthy
such
are
they
also
that
are
earthy
and
as
is
the
heavenly
such
are
we
have
borne
the
image
of
the
earthy
we
shall
also
bear
the
image
of
the
heavenly
now
this
i
say
brethren
that
flesh
and
blood
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
neither
doth
corruption
inherit
incorruption
behold
i
shew
you
a
mystery
we
shall
not
all
sleep
but
we
shall
all
be
changed
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
at
the
last
trump
for
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
the
dead
shall
be
raised
incorruptible
and
we
shall
be
changed
for
this
corruptible
must
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
must
put
on
immortality
so
when
this
corruptible
shall
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written
death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
oh
death
where
is
thy
sting
oh
grave
where
is
thy
victory
the
hands
of
oonomoo
and
of
the
missionary
suddenly
closed
with
incredible
force
and
rising
to
the
sitting
position
as
if
assisted
by
an
invisible
arm
they
both
opened
their
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
and
fixing
them
for
a
moment
upon
the
clear
sky
above
sunk
slowly
and
quietly
back
dead
a
profound
stillness
reigned
for
several
minutes
after
it
was
certain
the
spirits
of
oonomoo
and
fluellina
had
departed
gently
removing
their
heads
from
his
lap
to
the
ground
the
missionary
arose
and
in
so
doing
broke
the
spell
that
was
resting
upon
all
niniotan
stood
like
a
statue
his
arms
folded
and
his
stony
gaze
fixed
upon
the
senseless
forms
of
his
parents
placing
his
hand
upon
his
head
the
man
of
god
addressed
him
in
the
tones
of
a
father
let
niniotan
heed
the
words
of
oonomoo
let
him
grow
up
a
christian
warrior
and
when
his
spirit
leaves
this
world
it
will
join
his
and
fluellina
s
in
the
happy
hunting
grounds
in
the
sky
niniotan
i
offer
you
to
remain
your
mother
was
brought
to
me
when
an
infant
and
i
have
educated
her
in
the
fear
of
god
will
you
go
with
me
the
boy
replied
in
his
native
dialect
niniotan
will
never
forget
the
words
of
oonomoo
his
heart
is
warm
toward
the
kind
father
of
fluellina
and
he
will
never
forget
him
the
woods
are
the
home
of
niniotan
the
green
earth
is
his
bed
and
the
blue
sky
is
his
blanket
niniotan
goes
to
them
illustration
niniotan
stood
like
a
statue
his
arms
folded
and
his
stony
gaze
fixed
upon
the
senseless
forms
of
his
parents
turning
his
back
upon
his
white
friends
the
young
warrior
walked
away
and
soon
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
arches
of
the
forest
he
kept
his
word
living
a
life
of
usefulness
as
had
oonomoo
being
the
unswerving
friend
of
the
whites
all
through
tecumseh
s
war
and
dying
less
than
ten
years
since
in
the
indian
territory
beyond
the
mississippi
loved
and
respected
by
the
friends
said
the
missionary
you
have
witnessed
a
scene
which
i
trust
will
not
be
lost
upon
you
live
and
die
in
the
simple
faith
of
this
untutored
indian
and
all
will
be
well
captain
added
the
speaker
addressing
captain
prescott
he
has
been
a
true
friend
to
our
race
for
years
and
we
must
do
him
what
kindness
we
can
if
we
leave
these
bodies
here
the
shawnees
will
return
and
mutilate
them
god
bless
me
it
sha
nt
be
done
it
sha
nt
be

form
a
litter
boys
form
a
litter
and
place
them
on
it
we
ll
bury
them
at
the
settlement
and
build
them
a
monument
a
thousand
feet
high
yes
sir
every
inch
of
it
a
few
minutes
later
the
party
bearing
among
them
the
bodies
of
oonomoo
and
fluellina
set
out
for
the
settlement
which
was
reached
just
as
the
sun
was
disappearing
in
the
west
the
lifeless
forms
were
morning
a
large
and
deep
grave
was
dug
in
a
cool
grove
just
back
of
the
village
into
which
the
two
bodies
suitably
inclosed
were
lowered
the
last
rites
were
performed
by
the
good
missionary
and
as
the
sods
fell
upon
the
coffins
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
numerous
assembly
the
avowal
of
captain
prescott
that
the
faithful
huron
should
have
a
monument
erected
to
his
memory
was
something
more
than
the
impulse
of
the
moment
knowing
the
affection
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
the
settlers
all
along
the
frontier
he
took
pains
to
spread
the
particulars
of
his
death
and
to
invite
contributions
for
the
purpose
mentioned
the
response
was
far
more
liberal
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
and
showed
the
vast
services
of
oonomoo
during
his
life
services
of
which
none
but
the
recipients
knew
anything
at
imagination
under
bridges
built
by
the
romans
and
repaired
by
later
heroes
past
cities
and
castles
whose
very
names
were
music
to
my
ears
and
each
of
which
was
the
subject
of
a
legend
there
were
ehrenbreitstein
and
rolandseck
and
coblentz
which
i
knew
only
in
history
they
were
ruins
that
interested
me
chiefly
there
seemed
to
come
up
from
its
waters
and
its
departing
for
the
holy
land
i
floated
along
under
the
spell
of
enchantment
as
if
i
had
been
transported
to
an
heroic
age
and
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
chivalry
soon
after
i
went
to
see
a
panorama
of
the
mississippi
and
as
i
worked
my
way
up
the
river
in
the
light
of
today
and
saw
the
steamboats
wooding
up
counted
the
rising
cities
gazed
on
the
fresh
ruins
of
nauvoo
beheld
the
indians
moving
west
across
the
stream
and
as
before
i
had
looked
up
the
moselle
now
looked
up
the
ohio
and
the
missouri
and
heard
the
legends
of
dubuque
and
of
wenona
s
cliff
still
thinking
more
of
the
future
than
of
the
past
or
present
i
saw
that
this
was
a
rhine
stream
of
a
different
kind
that
the
foundations
of
castles
were
yet
to
be
laid
and
the
famous
bridges
were
yet
to
be
thrown
over
the
river
and
i
felt
that
this
was
the
heroic
age
itself
though
we
know
it
not
for
the
hero
west
of
which
i
speak
is
but
another
name
for
the
wild
and
what
i
have
been
preparing
to
say
is
that
in
wildness
is
the
preservation
of
the
world
every
tree
sends
its
fibers
forth
in
search
of
the
wild
the
cities
import
it
at
any
price
men
plow
and
sail
for
it
from
the
forest
and
wilderness
come
the
tonics
and
barks
which
brace
mankind
our
ancestors
were
savages
the
story
of
romulus
and
remus
being
suckled
by
a
wolf
is
not
a
meaningless
fable
the
founders
of
every
state
which
has
risen
to
eminence
have
drawn
their
nourishment
and
vigor
from
a
similar
wild
source
it
was
because
the
children
of
the
empire
were
not
suckled
by
the
wolf
that
they
were
conquered
and
displaced
by
the
children
of
the
northern
forests
who
were
i
believe
in
the
forest
and
in
the
meadow
and
in
the
night
in
which
the
corn
grows
we
require
an
infusion
of
hemlock
spruce
or
arbor
vitae
in
our
tea
there
is
a
difference
between
eating
and
eagerly
devour
the
marrow
of
the
koodoo
and
other
antelopes
raw
as
a
matter
of
course
some
of
our
northern
indians
eat
raw
the
marrow
of
the
arctic
reindeer
as
well
as
various
other
parts
including
the
summits
of
the
antlers
as
long
as
they
are
soft
and
herein
perchance
they
have
stolen
a
march
on
the
cooks
of
paris
they
get
what
usually
goes
to
feed
the
fire
this
is
probably
better
than
stall
fed
beef
and
slaughterhouse
pork
to
make
a
man
of
give
me
a
wildness
whose
glance
no
civilization
can
endure
as
if
we
lived
on
the
marrow
of
koodoos
devoured
raw
there
are
some
intervals
which
border
the
strain
of
the
wood
thrush
to
which
i
would
migrate
wild
lands
where
no
settler
has
squatted
to
which
methinks
i
am
already
acclimated
the
african
hunter
cumming
tells
us
that
the
skin
of
the
eland
as
well
as
that
of
most
other
antelopes
just
killed
emits
the
most
delicious
perfume
of
trees
and
grass
i
would
so
much
a
part
and
parcel
of
nature
that
his
very
person
should
thus
sweetly
advertise
our
senses
of
his
presence
and
remind
us
of
those
parts
of
nature
which
he
most
haunts
i
feel
no
disposition
to
be
satirical
when
the
trapper
s
coat
emits
the
odor
of
musquash
even
it
is
a
sweeter
scent
to
me
than
that
which
commonly
exhales
from
the
merchant
s
or
the
scholar
s
garments
when
i
go
into
their
wardrobes
and
handle
their
vestments
i
am
reminded
of
no
grassy
plains
and
flowery
meads
which
they
have
frequented
but
of
dusty
merchants
exchanges
and
libraries
rather
a
tanned
skin
is
something
more
than
respectable
and
perhaps
olive
is
a
fitter
color
than
white
for
a
man
a
denizen
of
the
woods
the
pale
white
man
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
african
pitied
him
darwin
the
naturalist
says
a
white
man
bathing
by
the
side
of
a
tahitian
was
like
a
plant
bleached
by
the
gardener
s
art
compared
with
a
fine
ben
jonson
exclaims
how
near
to
good
is
what
is
fair
so
i
would
say
how
near
to
good
is
what
is
wild
life
consists
with
wildness
the
most
alive
is
the
wildest
not
yet
subdued
to
man
its
presence
refreshes
him
one
who
pressed
forward
incessantly
and
never
rested
from
his
labors
who
grew
fast
and
made
infinite
demands
on
life
would
always
find
himself
in
a
new
country
or
wilderness
and
surrounded
by
the
raw
material
of
life
he
would
be
climbing
over
the
prostrate
stems
of
primitive
forest
trees
hope
and
the
future
for
me
are
not
in
lawns
and
cultivated
fields
not
in
towns
and
cities
but
in
the
impervious
and
quaking
swamps
when
formerly
i
have
analyzed
my
partiality
for
some
farm
which
i
had
contemplated
purchasing
i
have
frequently
found
that
i
was
attracted
solely
by
a
few
square
rods
of
impermeable
and
unfathomable
bog
a
natural
sink
in
one
corner
of
it
that
was
the
subsistence
from
the
swamps
which
surround
my
native
town
than
from
the
cultivated
gardens
in
the
village
there
are
no
richer
parterres
to
my
eyes
than
the
dense
beds
of
dwarf
andromeda
cassandra
calyculata
which
cover
these
tender
places
on
the
earth
s
surface
botany
can
not
go
farther
than
tell
me
the
names
of
the
shrubs
which
grow
there
the
high
blueberry
panicled
andromeda
lambkill
azalea
and
rhodora
all
standing
in
the
quaking
sphagnum
i
often
think
that
i
should
like
to
have
my
house
front
on
have
seen
old
tacticians
marchales
and
feldzeugmeisters
in
europe
with
el
dorado
on
each
shoulder
and
golconda
on
the
left
breast
who
would
have
tied
up
that
train
into
knots
that
none
of
them
would
be
alexander
enough
to
cut
chapter
ix
sizzum
and
his
heretics
no
sooner
had
this
nomad
town
settled
itself
quietly
for
the
night
than
a
town
meeting
collected
in
the
open
of
the
amphitheatre

jake
brent
asked
you
ve
never
told
me
why
you
see
i
was
naturally
of
a
religious
nater
and
i
ve
tried
em
all
but
i
never
fell
foul
of
a
religion
that
had
real
proved
miracles
till
i
seed
a
man
born
dumb
what
was
cured
by
the
prophet
joseph
looking
down
his
throat
and
tellin
his
palate
to
speak
up
and
it
did
speak
up
did
that
there
palate
and
went
on
talkin
most
oncommon
it
s
onbeknown
tongues
it
talks
suthin
like
gibberidge
but
joseph
said
that
was
how
the
tongues
sounded
in
the
apossles
time
to
them
as
had
nt
to
that
there
miracle
i
d
seen
em
gettin
up
the
sham
kind
when
i
was
to
the
italian
convent
and
i
knowed
the
fourth
proof
article
i
may
talk
rough
about
this
business
but
brother
brent
knows
i
m
honest
about
it
jake
led
us
forward
and
stationed
us
in
posts
of
honor
before
the
crowd
of
auditors
presently
sizzum
appeared
he
had
taken
time
to
tone
down
the
pioneer
and
develop
the
deacon
in
his
style
and
a
very
sleek
personage
he
had
made
of
himself
he
was
clean
shaved
clean
shaving
is
a
favorite
coxcombry
of
the
deacon
class
his
long
black
hair
growing
rank
from
a
muddy
skin
was
sleekly
put
behind
his
ears
a
large
white
blossom
of
cravat
expanded
under
his
nude
beefy
chin
and
he
wore
a
black
dress
coat
creased
with
its
recent
packing
except
that
his
pantaloons
were
thrust
into
boots
with
the
maker
s
name
abel
cushing
lynn
mass
stamped
in
gold
on
a
go
to
meetin
costume
a
chadband
of
the
plains
he
took
his
stand
and
began
to
fulmine
over
the
assemblage
his
manner
was
coarse
and
overbearing
with
intervals
of
oily
persuasiveness
he
was
a
big
powerful
man
without
one
atom
of
delicacy
in
him
a
fellow
who
never
could
take
a
flower
or
a
gentle
heart
into
his
hand
without
crushing
it
by
a
brutal
instinct
a
creature
with
such
an
amorphous
beak
of
a
nose
such
a
heavy
lipped
mouth
and
such
wilderness
of
jaw
could
never
perceive
the
fine
savor
of
any
delicate
thing
coarse
joys
were
the
only
joys
for
such
a
body
coarse
emotions
the
pleasures
of
force
and
domination
the
only
emotions
crude
enough
for
such
a
soul
his
voice
was
as
repulsive
as
his
mien
and
manner
that
badly
modelled
nose
had
an
important
office
in
his
oratory
through
it
he
hailed
his
auditors
to
open
their
hearts
as
a
canal
boatman
hails
the
locks
with
a
canal
horn
of
bassoon
calibre
but
sometimes
took
the
channel
of
his
mouth
and
his
great
lips
rolled
the
words
over
like
fat
morsels
pah
how
the
recollection
of
the
fellow
disgusts
me
and
yet
he
had
an
unwholesome
fascination
which
compelled
us
to
listen
i
could
easily
understand
how
he
might
overbear
feeble
minds
and
wheedle
those
that
loved
flattery
he
had
some
education
travel
had
polished
his
base
metal
so
that
it
shone
well
enough
to
deceive
the
vulgar
or
the
credulous
he
did
not
often
allow
himself
the
broad
coarseness
of
his
brother
preachers
in
the
church
shall
i
let
him
speak
for
himself
does
any
one
wish
to
hear
the
inspirations
of
the
last
faith
humanity
has
chosen
for
its
guide
no
such
travesty
of
true
religion
is
very
sorry
comedy
very
tragical
farce
vulgar
rant
and
cant
and
a
muddle
of
texts
and
dogmas
are
disgusting
to
hear
and
would
be
weariness
to
repeat
sizzum
s
sermon
suited
his
mixed
character
he
was
aaron
and
joshua
high
priest
and
captain
combined
orders
for
to
morrow
he
warned
against
the
perils
of
disobedience
he
raved
of
the
joys
and
privileges
of
latter
day
saintship
on
earth
and
in
heaven
he
heaped
vindictive
and
truculent
anathemas
upon
gentiles
he
gave
his
audience
to
understand
that
he
held
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
if
they
yielded
to
him
without
question
they
were
safe
in
life
and
eternity
if
they
murmured
they
were
cast
into
outer
darkness
it
was
terrible
to
see
the
man
s
despotism
over
his
proselytes
a
rumble
of
amens
from
the
crowd
greeted
alike
every
threat
and
every
promise
sizzum
s
discourse
lasted
half
an
hour
he
dismissed
his
audience
with
an
amen
and
an
injunction
to
keep
closer
to
the
train
on
the
march
to
morrow
and
not
be
rabbling
off
to
catch
grasshoppers
because
they
were
bigger
and
handsomer
than
the
lancashire
kind
and
this
is
one
of
the
religions
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
such
a
man
is
its
spokesman
said
brent
to
me
as
the
meeting
broke
up
it
is
a
shame
to
all
churches
that
they
have
not
trained
men
to
judge
of
evidence
and
so
rendered
such
a
delusion
impossible
but
christianity
tolerates
and
ever
reveres
myths
and
mythic
histories
and
such
toleration
and
reverence
offer
premiums
on
the
invention
of
new
mythologies
like
this
we
in
our
churches
teach
that
phenomena
can
add
authority
to
truth
we
necessarily
invite
miracle
mongers
joe
smiths
pio
nonos
to
produce
miracles
to
sustain
lies
i
suppose
said
brent
that
superstition
must
be
the
handmaid
of
religion
except
in
minds
very
holy
of
hot
tea
and
a
biscuit
take
these
please
she
said
i
do
nt
think
i
can
glory
i
do
nt
want
anything
but
he
told
me
to
take
care
of
you
miss
faith
that
also
had
a
power
with
faith
because
he
had
said
that
she
drank
the
tea
and
then
lay
back
so
tired
i
waited
up
till
you
came
sir
because
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
said
glory
meeting
mr
armstrong
once
more
upon
the
doorstone
as
he
returned
a
second
time
from
the
fire
she
s
gone
to
sleep
and
is
resting
beautiful
you
are
said
the
minister
and
he
put
his
hand
forth
and
grasped
hers
as
he
spoke
now
go
to
bed
and
rest
yourself
it
was
reward
enough
from
the
plenitude
that
waits
on
one
life
falls
a
crumb
that
stays
the
craving
of
another

xxx
aunt
henderson
s
mystery
oh
the
little
birds
sang
east
and
the
little
birds
sang
west
and
i
said
in
underbreath
all
our
life
is
mixed
with
death
and
who
knoweth
which
is
best
oh
the
little
birds
sang
east
and
the
little
birds
sang
west
and
i
smiled
to
think
god
s
greatness
flowed
around
our
incompleteness
round
our
restlessness
his
rest
mrs
browning
so
the
dreams
depart
so
the
fading
phantoms
flee
and
the
sharp
reality
now
must
act
its
part
westwood
it
was
a
little
after
noon
of
the
next
day
when
mr
rushleigh
came
to
cross
corners
faith
was
lying
back
terror
excitement
and
fatigue
she
had
gone
through
in
the
large
easy
chair
which
had
been
brought
for
her
into
the
southeast
room
miss
henderson
had
been
removed
from
her
bed
to
the
sofa
here
and
the
two
were
keeping
each
other
quiet
company
neither
could
bear
the
strain
of
nerve
to
dwell
long
or
particularly
on
the
events
of
the
night
the
story
had
been
told
as
simply
as
it
might
be
and
the
rest
and
the
thankfulness
were
all
they
could
think
of
now
so
there
were
deep
thoughts
and
few
words
between
them
on
faith
s
part
a
patient
waiting
for
a
trial
yet
before
her
it
s
mr
rushleigh
come
over
to
see
miss
faith
shall
i
bring
him
in
asked
glory
at
the
door
will
you
mind
it
aunt
asked
faith
i
no
said
miss
henderson
will
you
mind
my
being
here
that
s
the
question
i
d
take
myself
off
without
asking
if
faith
there
is
something
i
have
to
say
to
mr
rushleigh
which
will
be
very
hard
to
say
but
no
more
so
because
you
will
be
by
to
hear
it
it
is
better
so
i
shall
only
have
to
say
it
once
i
am
glad
you
should
be
with
me
brave
little
faithie
said
mr
rushleigh
coming
in
with
hands
outstretched
not
ill
i
hope
only
tired
faith
answered
and
a
little
weak
and
foolish
as
the
tears
would
come
in
answer
to
his
cordial
words
i
am
sorry
miss
henderson
that
i
could
not
have
persuaded
this
little
girl
to
go
home
with
me
last
night
this
morning
rather
but
she
would
come
to
you
she
did
just
right
aunt
faith
replied
it
s
the
proper
place
for
her
to
come
to
not
but
that
we
thank
you
all
the
same
you
re
very
kind
kinder
than
i
his
seat
beside
her
mr
rushleigh
would
not
let
her
lead
him
that
way
yet
he
ignored
the
little
whisper
and
by
a
gentle
question
or
two
drew
from
her
that
which
he
had
come
especially
to
learn
and
speak
of
to
day
the
story
of
the
fire
and
her
own
knowledge
of
and
share
in
it
as
she
alone
could
tell
it
now
for
the
first
time
as
she
recalled
it
to
explain
her
motive
for
entering
the
mill
at
all
the
rough
conversation
she
had
overheard
between
the
two
men
upon
the
river
bank
suggested
to
faith
as
the
mention
of
it
was
upon
her
lips
a
possible
clew
to
the
origin
of
the
mischief
she
paused
suddenly
and
a
look
of
dismayed
hesitation
came
over
her
face
i
ought
to
tell
you
all
i
suppose
she
continued
but
pray
sir
do
not
conclude
anything
hastily
the
two
things
may
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
and
then
to
her
ears
pausing
timidly
to
look
up
in
her
listener
s
face
to
judge
of
its
expression
a
smile
there
surprised
her
see
how
truth
is
always
best
said
mr
rushleigh
if
you
had
kept
back
your
knowledge
of
this
you
would
have
sealed
up
a
painful
doubt
for
your
own
tormenting
that
man
james
regan
came
to
me
this
morning
there
is
good
in
the
fellow
after
all
he
told
me
just
as
you
have
and
as
hardy
did
the
words
he
spoke
in
passion
he
was
afraid
he
said
they
might
be
brought
up
against
him
and
so
he
came
to
own
up
and
account
for
his
time
and
to
beg
me
to
believe
that
he
never
had
any
definite
thought
of
harm
i
told
him
i
did
believe
it
and
then
the
poor
fellow
rough
as
he
is
turned
pale
and
burst
into
tears
last
night
gave
him
a
lesson
i
out
of
him
blasland
says
he
worked
like
five
men
and
a
horse
at
the
fire
faith
s
face
glowed
as
she
listened
at
the
nobleness
of
these
two
of
the
generous
christian
gentleman
of
the
coarse
workman
who
wore
his
nature
like
his
garb
the
worse
part
of
an
everyday
fire
and
loss
are
not
all
calamity
when
such
as
this
comes
of
them
her
own
recital
was
soon
finished
mr
rushleigh
listened
giving
his
whole
sympathy
to
the
danger
she
had
faced
his
fresh
and
fervent
acknowledgment
and
admiring
praise
to
the
prompt
daring
she
had
shown
as
if
these
things
and
naught
else
had
been
in
either
mind
at
these
thanks
at
this
praise
faith
shrank
oh
mr
rushleigh
she
interrupted
dunce
look
round
in
the
grass
joe
did
look
and
his
mouth
fell
open
not
less
than
a
dozen
indians
were
in
view
they
rose
from
their
coverts
but
without
arms
and
at
the
bidding
of
william
came
forward
with
every
manifestation
of
amity
still
joe
was
frightened
and
seemed
disposed
to
slink
behind
biddy
who
had
dismissed
her
fears
most
of
the
indians
were
aged
chieftains
and
prophets
and
all
were
decked
in
their
richest
habiliments
william
explained
to
those
who
were
not
familiar
with
the
indian
tongue
that
the
king
of
the
camanches
was
the
uncle
of
la
u
na
and
that
he
had
seen
him
during
his
captivity
and
had
been
protected
by
him
on
several
occasions
of
peril
little
charley
was
delighted
with
the
gaudy
trappings
of
the
chief
and
even
little
juliet
soon
dismissed
indians
to
accompany
the
party
to
the
house
and
partake
of
a
feast
william
who
interpreted
for
them
said
it
would
be
an
infraction
of
a
treaty
with
the
apaches
who
doubtless
kept
spies
always
in
the
vicinity
but
ask
them
said
glenn
if
they
will
receive
some
presents
from
us
glenn
had
provided
an
ample
store
of
them
gladly
said
william
after
communicating
the
inquiry
will
it
be
wrong
to
make
these
presents
to
day
glenn
asked
of
mr
roughgrove
no
my
son
i
think
not
if
it
were
necessary
we
should
be
compelled
to
destroy
life
on
the
sabbath
and
how
much
better
it
is
to
preserve
than
to
destroy
joe
said
glenn
writing
rapidly
with
his
pencil
on
a
piece
of
paper
run
home
and
bring
me
these
articles
i
m
lame
mr
glenn
said
joe
i
hurt
my
ankle
when
i
fell
in
the
my
discovery
of
the
indians
cease
your
jargon
said
mr
roughgrove
william
ask
the
red
eagle
how
long
he
will
tarry
in
this
neighborhood
the
reply
was
that
it
would
depend
on
the
movements
of
the
apaches
of
which
he
received
information
from
his
spies
every
day
it
was
uncertain
the
red
eagle
and
his
prophets
would
see
the
white
spirit
at
night
and
then
they
would
learn
more
the
white
spirit
said
william
they
inform
me
is
a
living
being
whom
they
can
see
and
touch
and
he
dwells
in
the
cave
but
if
you
have
no
objection
i
will
promise
to
meet
them
an
hour
hence
upon
the
brink
of
the
chasm
with
the
presents
this
was
agreed
to
and
joe
was
relieved
but
pretending
not
to
be
cognizant
of
the
agreement
he
set
off
limping
slightly
towards
the
valley
stop
joe
said
glenn
who
had
not
heard
his
excuse
with
the
presents
you
need
not
go
i
m
perfectly
willing
to
go
said
joe
only
i
ca
nt
run
very
fast
but
maybe
when
my
blood
gets
a
little
warm
the
lameness
will
leave
me
never
mind
i
say
we
have
made
other
arrangements
oh
very
well
then
i
ll
go
with
the
rest
as
joe
returned
towards
the
company
a
very
old
indian
whom
he
had
almost
trodden
on
in
the
rank
grass
without
seeing
him
rose
up
and
confronted
him
with
a
broad
smile
on
his
face
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
exclaimed
joe
me
talk
english
said
the
old
man
me
once
tie
you
to
tree
me
once
going
to
burn
you
and
the
long
brave
white
man
you
old
rascal
you
cried
joe
in
a
tremendous
rage
you
pulled
my
hair
too
threw
down
his
cap
and
began
to
strip
off
his
coat
when
he
was
interrupted
by
glenn
would
you
fight
a
man
over
a
hundred
years
old
asked
glenn
no
said
joe
putting
on
his
cap
and
coat
again
i
did
nt
know
he
was
that
old
you
never
can
tell
how
old
these
fellows
are
because
they
shave
off
their
hair
and
of
course
it
ai
nt
gray
but
mr
glenn
he
s
strong
he
s
the
one
who
pulled
my
hair
out
once
when
they
caught
sneak
and
me
in
the
woods
he
has
left
off
fighting
now
said
william
smiling
who
had
interpreted
joe
s
words
to
red
eagle
and
had
received
the
information
he
imparted
to
joe
in
return
he
is
a
prophet
or
priest
and
is
as
harmless
as
a
dove
but
as
wise
as
a
serpent
and
if
mr
glenn
had
nt
stopped
me
said
served
him
as
the
black
snake
served
the
rattle
snake
the
pipe
of
peace
was
then
smoked
even
in
the
prairie
and
the
company
from
the
valley
took
leave
of
the
children
of
the
forest
but
before
this
was
done
red
eagle
bestowed
several
beautiful
presents
on
la
u
na
and
mary
consisting
of
precious
stones
a
boon
he
alone
might
confer
to
the
children
some
stuffed
birds
of
exquisite
plumage
and
he
threw
around
biddy
s
neck
the
stuffed
skin
of
a
rattlesnake
och
st
peter
murther
take
the
nasty
varmint
away
cried
she
oh
misther
glenn
misther
william
saize
it
kill
it
it
s
not
a
snake
said
joe
its
only
a
stuffed
skin
of
one
and
a
fine
present
it
is
keep
it
biddy
it
ll
be
a
nice
thing
to
show
when
we
get
to
house
keeping
together
see
here
s
all
the
rattles
as
perfect
as
life
and
they
ll
please
the
children
striving
to
get
it
from
around
her
neck
but
fearing
to
touch
it
with
her
hands
to
the
infinite
diversion
of
the
indians
the
party
returned
without
delay
to
the
valley
they
had
intended
to
enter
the
cave
during
their
rambles
but
this
was
postponed
for
a
future
occasion
biddy
said
joe
when
they
were
about
to
pass
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
children
being
with
their
parents
some
distance
in
advance
would
nt
you
like
to
go
in
here
and
see
the
white
spirit
the
indians
talk
so
much
about
murther
no
i
m
frightened
most
into
fits
now
at
the
thoughts
of
the
things
oh
the
bloody
snakes
but
only
try
to
show
you
where
there
are
diseases
more
subtle
and
dangerous
than
any
that
vex
our
flesh
diseases
that
should
be
as
carefully
cured
if
curable
as
inexorably
prevented
from
spreading
as
any
malady
we
dread
a
paralyzed
will
a
morbid
mind
a
mad
temper
a
tainted
heart
a
blind
soul
are
afflictions
to
be
as
much
regarded
as
bodily
infirmities
nay
more
inasmuch
as
souls
are
of
greater
value
than
perishable
flesh
where
this
is
religiously
taught
believed
and
practised
marriage
becomes
in
truth
a
sacrament
blessed
of
god
children
thank
parents
for
the
gift
of
life
parents
see
in
children
living
satisfactions
and
rewards
not
reproaches
or
retributions
doubly
heavy
to
be
borne
for
the
knowledge
that
where
two
sinned
many
must
inevitably
suffer
you
try
to
tell
me
gently
faith
but
i
see
that
you
consider
me
one
of
the
innocent
unfortunates
who
have
no
right
to
marry
till
they
be
healed
perhaps
never
i
have
dimly
felt
this
during
the
past
year
have
no
child
to
reproach
me
hereafter
for
bequeathing
it
the
mental
ills
i
have
not
yet
outlived
dear
sylvia
you
are
an
exceptional
case
in
all
respects
because
an
extreme
one
the
ancient
theology
of
two
contending
spirits
in
one
body
is
strangely
exemplified
in
you
for
each
rules
by
turns
and
each
helps
or
hinders
as
moods
and
circumstances
lead
even
in
the
great
event
of
a
woman
s
life
you
were
thwarted
by
conflicting
powers
impulse
and
ignorance
passion
and
pride
hope
and
despair
now
you
stand
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
looking
wistfully
along
the
pleasant
one
where
adam
seems
to
beckon
while
i
point
down
the
rugged
one
where
i
have
walked
and
though
my
heart
aches
as
i
do
it
counsel
you
as
i
would
a
daughter
of
my
own
i
thank
you
i
will
follow
you
but
my
life
looks
very
barren
if
i
must
relinquish
my
desire
not
as
barren
as
if
you
possessed
mistake
could
you
have
loved
geoffrey
it
might
have
been
safe
and
well
with
you
loving
adam
it
is
neither
let
me
show
you
why
he
is
an
exception
like
yourself
perhaps
that
explains
your
attraction
for
each
other
in
him
the
head
rules
in
geoffrey
the
heart
the
one
criticises
the
other
loves
mankind
geoffrey
is
proud
and
private
in
all
that
lies
nearest
him
clings
to
persons
and
is
faithful
as
a
woman
adam
has
only
the
pride
of
an
intellect
which
tests
all
things
and
abides
by
its
own
insight
he
clings
to
principles
persons
are
but
animated
facts
or
ideas
he
seizes
searches
uses
them
and
when
they
have
no
more
for
him
drops
them
like
the
husk
whose
kernel
he
has
secured
passing
on
to
find
and
study
other
samples
without
regret
but
with
unabated
zeal
for
life
to
him
is
perpetual
progress
and
he
obeys
the
law
of
his
nature
as
steadily
as
sun
or
sea
what
more
faith
few
women
if
wise
would
dare
to
marry
this
man
noble
and
love
worthy
as
he
is
till
time
has
tamed
and
experience
developed
him
even
then
the
risk
is
great
for
he
demands
and
unconsciously
absorbs
into
himself
the
personality
of
others
making
large
returns
but
of
a
kind
which
only
those
as
strong
sagacious
and
steadfast
as
himself
can
receive
and
adapt
to
their
individual
uses
without
being
overcome
and
possessed
that
none
of
us
should
be
except
by
the
spirit
stronger
than
man
purer
than
woman
you
feel
though
you
do
not
understand
this
power
you
know
that
his
presence
excites
yet
wearies
you
that
while
you
love
you
fear
him
and
even
when
you
long
to
be
all
in
all
to
him
you
doubt
your
ability
to
make
his
happiness
am
i
not
right
i
must
say
yes
then
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
that
one
for
you
bright
at
its
beginning
dark
at
its
end
with
him
you
would
exhaust
yourself
in
passionate
endeavors
to
follow
where
he
led
he
would
not
know
this
you
would
not
confess
it
but
too
late
you
might
both
learn
that
you
were
too
young
too
ardent
too
frail
in
all
but
the
might
of
love
to
be
his
wife
it
is
like
a
woodbird
mating
with
an
eagle
straining
its
little
wings
to
scale
the
sky
with
him
blinding
itself
with
gazing
at
the
sun
striving
to
fill
and
warm
the
wild
eyrie
which
becomes
its
home
and
perishing
in
the
stern
solitude
the
other
loves
yet
too
fond
and
faithful
to
regret
the
safer
nest
among
the
grass
the
gentler
mate
it
might
have
had
the
summer
life
and
winter
flitting
to
the
south
for
which
it
was
designed
faith
you
frighten
me
you
seem
to
see
and
show
me
all
the
dim
forebodings
i
have
hidden
away
within
myself
because
i
could
you
learned
so
much
how
can
you
read
me
so
well
and
who
told
you
these
things
of
us
all
i
had
an
unhappy
girlhood
in
a
discordant
home
early
cares
and
losses
made
me
old
in
youth
and
taught
me
to
observe
how
others
bore
their
burdens
since
then
solitude
has
led
me
to
study
and
reflect
upon
the
question
toward
which
my
thoughts
inevitably
turned
concerning
yourself
and
your
past
geoffrey
told
me
much
but
adam
more
have
you
seen
him
has
he
been
here
when
faith
when
light
and
color
flashed
back
into
sylvia
s
face
and
the
glad
eagerness
of
her
voice
was
a
pleasant
sound
to
hear
after
the
despairing
accents
gone
before
faith
sighed
but
answered
fully
carefully
while
the
compassion
of
her
look
deepened
as
she
spoke
i
saw
him
but
a
week
ago
vehement
and
vigorous
as
ever
he
has
come
hither
often
during
the
winter
has
watched
you
unseen
and
brought
me
news
he
said
you
bade
him
hear
of
you
through
me
that
he
preferred
to
come
not
write
for
letters
were
often
rough
