me
that
she
and
daddy
named
me
dawn
because
i
was
born
at
the
break
of
day
that
was
the
first
of
a
thousand
lies
momma
and
daddy
would
tell
me
and
my
brother
jimmy
of
course
we
would
nt
know
they
were
lies
not
for
a
long
time
not
until
the
day
they
came
to
take
us
away
chapter
another
new
place
the
sound
of
dresser
drawers
being
opened
and
closed
woke
me
i
heard
momma
and
daddy
whispering
in
their
room
and
my
heart
began
to
thump
fast
and
hard
i
pressed
my
palm
against
my
chest
took
a
deep
breath
and
turned
to
wake
jimmy
but
he
was
already
sitting
up
in
our
sofa
bed
bathed
in
the
silvery
moonlight
that
came
pouring
through
our
bare
window
my
sixteen
year
old
brother
s
face
looked
chiseled
from
granite
he
sat
there
so
still
listening
i
lay
there
listening
with
him
listening
to
the
hateful
wind
whistle
through
the
cracks
and
crannies
of
this
small
small
rundown
town
just
outside
of
washington
d
c
we
had
been
here
barely
four
months
what
is
it
jimmy
what
s
going
on
i
asked
shivering
partly
from
the
cold
and
partly
because
deep
inside
i
knew
the
answer
jimmy
fell
back
against
his
pillow
and
then
brought
his
hands
behind
his
head
in
a
sulk
he
stared
up
at
the
dark
ceiling
the
pace
of
momma
s
and
daddy
s
movements
became
more
frenzied
we
were
gon
na
get
a
puppy
here
jimmy
mumbled
and
this
spring
momma
and
i
were
gon
na
plant
a
garden
and
grow
our
own
vegetables
i
could
feel
his
frustration
and
anger
like
heat
from
an
iron
radiator
what
happened
i
asked
mournfully
for
i
too
had
high
hopes
daddy
came
home
later
than
usual
he
said
a
prophetic
note
of
doom
in
his
voice
he
rushed
in
here
his
eyes
wild
you
know
bright
and
there
and
not
long
after
they
started
packing
might
as
well
get
up
and
get
dressed
jimmy
said
throwing
the
blanket
off
him
and
turning
to
sit
up
they
ll
be
out
here
shortly
tellin
us
to
do
it
anyway
i
groaned
not
again
and
not
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
jimmy
leaned
over
to
turn
on
the
lamp
by
our
pull
out
bed
and
started
to
put
on
his
socks
so
he
would
nt
have
to
step
down
on
a
cold
floor
he
was
so
depressed
he
did
nt
even
worry
about
getting
dressed
in
front
of
me
i
fell
back
and
watched
him
unfold
his
pants
so
he
could
slip
into
them
moving
with
a
quiet
resignation
that
made
everything
around
me
seem
more
like
a
dream
how
i
wished
it
were
i
was
fourteen
years
old
and
for
as
long
as
i
could
remember
we
had
been
packing
and
unpacking
going
from
one
place
to
another
it
always
seemed
that
just
when
my
a
new
school
and
finally
made
some
friends
and
i
got
to
know
my
teachers
we
had
to
leave
maybe
we
really
were
no
better
than
homeless
gypsies
like
jimmy
always
said
wanderers
poorer
than
the
poorest
for
even
the
poorest
families
had
some
place
they
could
call
home
some
place
they
could
return
to
when
things
went
bad
a
place
where
they
had
grandmas
and
grandpas
or
uncles
and
aunts
to
hug
them
and
comfort
them
and
make
them
feel
good
again
we
would
have
settled
even
for
cousins
at
least
i
would
have
i
peeled
back
the
blanket
and
my
nightgown
fell
away
and
exposed
most
of
my
bosom
i
glanced
at
jimmy
and
caught
him
gazing
at
me
in
the
moonlight
he
shifted
his
eyes
away
quickly
embarrassment
made
my
heart
pitterpatter
and
i
pressed
my
palm
against
the
bodice
of
my
nightgown
i
had
never
told
any
of
my
girlfriends
at
school
that
jimmy
and
i
shared
even
a
room
together
much
less
this
dilapidated
pull
out
bed
i
react
embarrassing
both
jimmy
and
me
even
more
i
brought
my
feet
down
on
the
freezing
cold
bare
wood
floor
my
teeth
chattering
i
embraced
myself
and
hurried
across
the
small
room
to
gather
up
a
blouse
and
a
sweater
and
a
pair
of
jeans
then
i
went
into
the
bathroom
to
dress
by
the
time
i
finished
jimmy
had
his
suitcase
closed
it
seemed
we
always
left
something
else
behind
each
time
there
was
only
so
much
room
in
daddy
s
old
car
anyway
i
folded
my
nightgown
and
put
it
neatly
into
my
own
suitcase
the
clasps
were
as
hard
as
ever
to
close
and
jimmy
had
to
help
momma
and
daddy
s
bedroom
door
opened
and
they
came
out
their
suitcases
in
hand
too
we
stood
there
facing
them
holding
our
own
why
do
we
have
to
leave
in
the
middle
of
the
night
again
i
asked
looking
at
daddy
and
wondering
if
leaving
would
make
him
angry
as
it
so
often
did
best
time
to
with
a
quick
order
not
to
ask
too
many
questions
jimmy
was
right
daddy
had
that
wild
look
again
a
look
that
seemed
so
unnatural
it
sent
shivers
up
and
down
my
spine
i
hated
it
when
daddy
got
that
look
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
rugged
features
a
cap
of
sleek
brown
hair
and
dark
coal
eyes
when
the
day
came
that
i
fell
in
love
and
decided
to
marry
i
hoped
my
husband
would
be
just
as
handsome
as
daddy
but
i
hated
it
when
daddy
was
displeased
when
he
got
that
wild
look
it
marred
his
handsome
features
and
made
him
ugly
something
i
could
nt
bear
to
see
jimmy
take
the
suitcases
down
dawn
you
help
your
momma
pack
up
whatever
she
wants
from
the
kitchen
i
glanced
at
jimmy
he
was
only
two
years
older
than
i
was
but
there
was
a
wider
gap
in
our
looks
he
was
tall
and
lean
and
muscular
like
daddy
i
was
small
with
chapter
one
lt
whitneyville
idaho
territory
april
the
keening
whine
of
the
train
whistle
deepened
emma
chalmers
despair
at
the
ending
of
anna
karenina
and
she
sniffled
as
she
slammed
the
book
closed
she
then
hastily
dried
her
eyes
with
a
wadded
handkerchief
trimmed
in
blue
tatting
and
smoothed
the
skirts
of
her
prim
brown
sateen
dress
grabbing
up
a
new
supply
of
posters
she
d
just
had
printed
over
at
the
newspaper
office
emma
dashed
for
the
door
the
whitneyville
lending
library
was
empty
and
she
did
nt
bother
to
lock
up
since
no
one
she
knew
would
have
stooped
so
low
as
to
steal
a
book
and
she
d
collected
only
two
cents
in
fines
she
saw
a
slim
figure
reflected
back
to
her
as
she
passed
the
spotless
windows
of
the
general
store
emma
quickened
her
steps
as
it
had
been
her
experience
that
some
of
the
conductors
and
stagecoach
drivers
would
evade
her
if
given
the
opportunity
as
she
passed
the
yellow
belly
saloon
with
its
peeling
sawdust
and
beer
and
sweat
came
out
to
wrap
themselves
around
her
like
an
insidious
vine
emma
broke
into
a
ladylike
sprint
clutching
her
posters
to
her
shapely
bosom
with
one
hand
and
keeping
her
skirts
out
of
the
dirt
and
tobacco
juice
on
the
sidewalk
with
the
other
her
bright
hair
pulled
into
a
single
thick
plait
swung
as
she
ran
the
railroad
yard
was
crowded
with
arriving
and
departing
passengers
most
were
human
but
there
were
some
pigs
and
horses
and
an
occasional
crate
of
squawking
chickens
emma
picked
her
way
through
the
throng
as
daintily
as
she
could
and
with
a
practiced
eye
sought
out
the
conductor
a
well
fed
man
with
a
ruddy
complexion
and
thick
white
hair
he
was
half
hidden
behind
a
shipment
of
canned
meats
bound
for
the
general
store
after
clearing
her
throat
a
sound
barely
discernible
in
the
din
emma
approached
good
afternoon
mr
lathrop
she
said
politely
miss
emma
mr
lathrop
answered
with
a
nod
of
his
bushy
head
i
m
afraid
there
s
no
news
today
it
just
seems
like
nobody
in
this
whole
part
of
the
country
knows
anything
about
your
sisters
even
though
she
d
expected
this
answer
after
all
she
d
gotten
virtually
the
same
one
every
week
for
nearly
thirteen
years
emma
was
stricken
for
a
moment
with
the
purest
of
sorrow
if
if
you
would
just
pass
these
bills
out
as
you
go
along
mr
lathrop
accepted
the
stack
of
crisply
printed
placards
and
held
one
up
with
great
ceremony
for
his
pensive
perusal
it
read
reward
cash
for
any
information
leading
to
the
location
of
miss
caroline
chalmers
dark
of
hair
and
eyes
or
miss
lily
chalmers
fair
and
having
brown
eyes
please
contact
miss
emma
chalmers
in
care
of
the
whitneyville
lending
library
whitneyville
idaho
territory
perhaps
i
should
have
said
thank
you
emma
fretted
bending
around
mr
lathrop
s
ample
shoulder
to
read
the
bold
print
plain
enough
that
you
d
be
grateful
for
any
help
miss
emma
she
sighed
sometimes
it
just
seems
hopeless
sort
of
like
the
ending
of
anna
karenina
have
you
read
that
book
mr
lathrop
he
looked
bewildered
not
so
as
i
remember
miss
emma
a
man
does
nt
get
much
chance
to
read
when
he
spends
his
days
on
the
rails
emma
nodded
soberly
as
she
handed
over
the
rest
of
the
posters
i
suppose
not
the
noise
would
be
powerfully
distracting
i
should
think
it
was
mr
lathrop
s
solemn
duty
to
see
that
pigs
and
people
found
their
proper
places
aboard
the
train
therefore
he
left
emma
her
posters
in
his
arms
after
favoring
her
with
a
little
tip
of
his
hat
every
christmas
emma
remembered
him
with
a
pair
of
knitted
socks
and
a
box
of
walnut
fudge
and
she
wondered
now
if
that
was
proper
recompense
for
a
man
who
had
tried
so
steadfastly
to
be
helpful
and
departing
passengers
for
she
d
never
stopped
hoping
to
find
one
of
her
sisters
among
them
walking
alongside
the
track
she
nearly
collided
with
a
ramp
extending
from
one
of
the
boxcars
not
to
mention
the
man
and
horse
coming
down
that
ramp
emma
gave
a
startled
gasp
and
leaped
backwards
while
the
man
smiled
at
her
from
the
saddle
and
touched
the
brim
of
his
battered
hat
he
looked
like
a
seedy
saddlebum
with
no
gentle
qualities
to
recommend
him
and
yet
emma
felt
a
not
unpleasant
tug
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
as
she
returned
his
regard
you
ought
to
look
where
you
re
going
she
said
crisply
controlling
his
mount
with
barely
perceptible
movements
of
his
gloved
hands
the
stranger
urged
the
nervous
horse
into
the
dirt
and
cinders
at
the
side
of
the
tracks
apparently
he
found
the
fact
that
emma
had
taken
umbrage
very
amusing
because
he
was
still
grinning
his
teeth
wickedly
white
against
a
sun
browned
beard
stubbled
face
he
gave
a
mocking
ladyship
he
said
then
he
let
out
a
low
hoot
of
laughter
and
rode
off
emma
smoothed
her
hair
then
sighed
as
she
lifted
her
skirts
and
started
back
the
way
she
d
come
it
seemed
to
her
that
no
one
bothered
to
cultivate
good
manners
any
longer
because
something
about
the
man
on
the
horse
had
disturbed
her
emma
forcibly
shifted
her
mind
to
the
search
for
her
sisters
even
if
she
came
face
to
face
with
lily
or
caroline
she
thought
in
despair
she
might
not
recognize
them
people
could
change
so
much
in
thirteen
years
they
would
be
grown
women
now
emma
did
not
come
out
of
her
reverie
until
she
was
passing
the
first
territorial
bank
through
the
window
she
spotted
fulton
whitney
who
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
aspired
to
be
her
husband
he
was
tall
and
blond
and
he
looked
very
handsome
in
his
gray
pin
striped
trousers
with
a
vest
over
his
white
linen
shirt
and
there
was
a
gentlemanly
garter
to
teach
girls
to
sit
up
straight
nurse
says
i
m
round
shouldered
and
she
puts
me
on
it
whenever
she
can
daine
shuddered
it
sounds
horrible
i
ve
never
heard
kally
princess
kalasin

such
a
thing
good
if
we
get
out
of
all
this
please
tell
my
nurse
the
princess
does
nt
have
one
anyway
i
left
through
the
secret
passage
in
the
family
wing
i
was
behind
yolane
s
study
when
i
heard
belden
yell
what
do
you
mean
he
s
gone
i
heard
tristan
and
yolane
say
be
quiet
and
i
stopped
there

spy
holes
in
all
the
rooms
so
i
could
see
and
hear
everything
it
was
them
and
the
others

and
gissa
and
they
were
nt
going

the
city

wrote
and
invited
them

out
cheese
and
a
sausage
cutting
off
portions
for
herself
and
for
maura
so
what
did
you
hear
tristan
told
belden
it
s
all
under
control
and
belden
said
tristan
told
him
master
numair
would
pass
out
from
the
nightbloom
in
his
wine
and
when
that
did
nt
work
tristan
said
there
was
no
way
master
numair
could
leave
the
valley
yolane
said
they
re
in
trouble
if
numair
warns
the
king
and
tristan
said
he
only
knows
tristan
and
alamid
and
gissa

here
he
said
they
ll
warn
the
other
con
conspirators
and
speed
up
the
rebellion

ll
strike
with
the
next
full
moon
not

brushes

and
ink

down
shaking
the
bottle
of
readymade
ink

main
points
of
what

said
thus
far

on
maura

some
water
belden
said
he
did
nt
like
how
this
is
going
and
tristan
told
the
mages
to
show
belden
how
they
d
ward
the
valley
and
they
left
after
that
yolane
said
she
hoped
this
would
work
tristan
said
as
long
as
she
keeps
up
her
end
she
ll
be
queen
by
the
first
snows
and
yolane
said
how
can
she
keep
her
bargain
when
the
next
shipment
is
sealed
in
with
us
tristan
said
they
ll
handle
that
when
the
shipment
s
ready
then
he
started
kissing
her
and
saying
what
a
fine
queen
she
d
make
and
i
left
i
snuck
out
of
the
castle
that
night
i
hoped
i
could
get
out
of
dunlath
before
they
closed
it
off
can
you
remember
anything
else
maura
shook
her
head
i
told
you

kept
going
over
it
in
my
head
out
what
s
this
shipment
they
talked
about
whatever
they
mine
up
in
the
north
part
of
the
valley
they
ve
been
sending
that
out
of
dunlath
all
summer
daine
put
her
things
away
and
tucked
her
notes
into
the
waistband
of
her
breeches
numair
has
to
know
all
this
he
can
warn
the
king
he
can
speak
over
distances
with
his
gift
the
younger
girl
sighed
i
wish
i
could
do
that
it
would
make
things
a
lot
easier
is
there
anyone
in
the
valley
who
can
maura
shook
her
head
just
tristan
and
his
friends
some
villagers
have
the
gift
but
it
s
like
mine
just
good
for
a
couple
of
things
and
nobody
can
far
speak
anyone
who
has
a
strong
gift

to
get
better
training

sighed
that
s
typical
one
last
thing

of

would
nt
tell
me

of
this

duty
to
the
crown
but
i
have
nt
she
rubbed
her
sleeve
over
her
eyes
touched
daine
gave
her
friend
a
quick
hug
all
right
i
have
to
take
this
to
numair
look
after
kitten
while
i
m
gone
wo
nt
you
cloud
also
stayed
behind
as
daine
returned
to
the
barrier
on
a
slope
nearby
the
girl
found
a
tumble
of
rock
one
huge
slab
of
which
formed
a
lean
to
against
its
fellows
she
hid
there
out
of
the
open
and
began
to
write
using
the
notes
she
had
taken
from
maura
to
that
she
added
the
news
that
the
barrier
enclosed
the
entire
valley
she
was
finishing
when
she
heard
the
high
singing
note
that
was
tkaa
s
presence
in
her
mind
peering
out
of
her
shelter
she
saw
the
basilisk
step
through
the
barrier
and
waved
him
up
to
her
hiding
place
he
says
he
can
not
break
this
spell
nu
wt
summon
more
help
daine
rewet
her
brush
and
added
a
further
note
to
her
letter
ca
nt
you
use
one
of
those
words
of
power
on
it
he
is
unusual
tkaa
remarked
as
daine
waited
for
her
ink
to
dry
when
i
crossed
the
barrier
he
thought
i
meant
to
attack
he
threw
fire
at
me
i
sang
the
rock
spell
without
thinking
i
am
not
at
my
best
when
i
am
rushed
a
note
that
might
have
been
amusement
entered
his
soft
mental
voice
he
became
stone
of
course
the
spell
never
fails
it
lasted
for
a
breath
and
then
he
shattered
it
as
if
all
i
had
done
was
pour
clay
on
him
and
bake
it
and
then
he
asked
me
to
do
it
again
to
see
of
he
could
break
the
spell
twice
daine
rubbed
her
aching
head
he
would
she
said
dryly
and
did
you
i
suggested
that
us
have
the
leisure
to
enact
them
properly
if
you
encounter
dragons
you
will
find
the
same
excuse
works
with
them
more
than
anything
dragons
and
mages
like
to
take
time
with
their
studies
well
thank
mithros
for
that
replied
the
girl
will
you
take
this
to
him
it
s
important
to
become
a
messenger
at
my
age
tkaa
remarked
shaking
his
head
daine
smiled
up
at
him
thank
you
i
am
grateful
for
your
help
there
was
affection
in
his
voice
when
he
get
up
and
call
him
and
tell
him
she
needed
help
he
d
come
home
and
together
they
d
figure
out
what
to
do
professional
help
maybe
or
something
just
as
simple
as
signing
up
for
a
course
in
something
unusual
at
the
university
or
dinner
out
and
a
movie
like
out
of
date
alka
seltzer
in
standing
water
whatever
became
of
delia
oh
her
shelf
life
expired
such
an
unshame
she
closed
her
eyes
and
pretended
to
sleep
sometime
later
she
pretended
to
visualize
the
view
from
the
window
overlooking
the
bus
stop
the
boys
capered
in
the
wet
and
the
dark
one
less
than
they
had
been
however
many
there
were
and
she
knew
they
were
aware
she
was
watching
they
d
been
aware
all
along
and
they
d
been
holding
her
their
aimless
movements
actually
an
arcane
little
raindance
meant
to
mesmerize
as
it
wove
a
pattern
that
worked
only
on
someone
who
had
receded
far
enough
so
far
that
joe
shook
her
arm
once
and
then
twice
so
she
pretended
to
wake
up
it
s
the
weather
joe
said
they
say
it
s
a
cycle
of
tropical
storms
affecting
the
northern
latitudes
happens
every
few
years
everyone
s
walking
around
with
their
eyes
glazed
and
their
mouths
hanging
open
but
it
ought
feel
like
a
new
person
trust
me
she
did
trust
him
delia
thought
her
unlife
was
completely
in
his
hands
or
had
been
until
it
had
started
slipping
through
his
fingers
what
would
happen
when
he
discovered
she
was
a
failed
human
being
or
rather
what
would
unhappen
she
got
up
from
the
easy
chair
and
went
to
the
window
peering
through
the
dribbles
of
rain
all
right
joe
said
after
a
long
pause
have
it
your
way
do
nt
do
anything
do
nt
be
anything
i
saw
you
had
that
book
out
you
did
nt
read
it
though
did
you
pat
cadigan
hi
v
no
she
said
in
a
small
voice
the
boys
were
showily
keeping
their
hacks
to
her
she
could
tell
by
the
way
their
silhouettes
bent
and
dipped
against
the
faint
shine
of
the
wet
pavement
all
right
he
said
again
there
s
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
deals
no
one
can
pull
you
out
of
this
until
you
reach
out
i
ve
thrown
you
a
rope
several
times
but
you
ve
refused
to
grab
onto
it
the
boys
made
a
momentary
tableau
around
the
bench
like
a
dance
troupe
pausing
at
a
rest
in
the
music
lightning
strobed
silently
their
face
were
turned
upward
to
the
window
now
and
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
rain
beaded
on
their
colorless
cheeks
it
s
not
refusal
joe
it
s
paralysis
he
did
nt
answer
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
turn
around
and
see
that
he
had
absurdly
fallen
asleep
his
ever
present
book
tented
over
his
crotch
delia
pressed
her
hands
against
her
mouth
locked
out
she
could
nt
get
back
in
now
if
she
tried
with
all
her
strength
the
rain
made
white
noise
against
the
windows
on
the
street
no
she
straightened
up
throwing
off
the
afghan
she
d
wrapped
around
her
shoulders
no
she
would
not
accept
state
of
un
she
would
fight
her
way
back
in
if
it
meant
she
had
to
die
in
the
attempt
but
she
would
die
real
yo
melodrama
that
s
right
you
wan
na
make
something
of
it
she
went
to
the
closet
by
the
front
door
and
yanked
out
the
first
coat
she
touched
an
old
army
surplus
jacket
of
joe
s
that
they
d
been
hanging
onto
for
no
reason
except
inertia
well
the
age
of
inertia
was
over
she
thought
as
she
thrust
herself
into
it
she
d
use
it
and
anything
else
she
d
use
everything
usable
and
anything
unusable
would
go
out
in
the
trash
she
paused
in
the
half
open
door
and
looked
back
at
joe
his
breathing
was
heavy
but
soft
not
quite
a
snore
then
she
stomped
out
afire
with
resolve
she
marched
down
seven
flights
of
stairs
rather
than
waiting
for
the
elevator
strode
through
the
empty
lobby
and
pushed
stiffarmed
out
the
security
door
the
rain
in
ultimate
anti
climax
had
catching
her
breath
they
only
came
out
in
the
rain
they
were
gone
now
and
just
what
had
she
thought
she
was
going
to
accomplish
anyway
confront
them
and
do
what
order
them
off
her
turf
and
forbid
them
ever
to
return
to
steal
her
soul
they
were
just
a
bunch
of
boys
in
the
goddamn
rain
and
she
was
a
crazy
person
with
symptoms
straight
out
of
the
paranoia
textbook
yes
doctor
boys
in
the
rain
have
been
stealing
my
soul
and
not
i
dirty
work
v
only
that
aliens
have
been
giving
me
sinus
headaches
and
the
pentagon
has
been
using
an
invisible
ray
that
s
disrupted
my
sex
life
too
which
was
worse
thinking
you
were
going
un
or
knowing
you
were
going
crazy
the
hair
on
the
back
of
her
neck
she
thought
might
have
been
standing
up
yes
it
very
well
might
have
now
attend
class
we
shall
take
our
first
steps
out
of
the
locked
ward
by
walking
to
that
it
is
only
a
bus
stop
where
nothing
ever
happens
except
that
perfectly
ordinary
people
wait
for
a
bus
sometimes
in
the
rain
and
it
is
not
significant
in
any
way
to
anyone
least
of
all
us
the
only
un
we
are
going
to
experience
is
that
of
going
uncrazy
she
reached
around
the
corner
hesitated
and
forced
herself
to
step
off
the
curb
and
cross
the
street
watching
the
bench
and
the
bus
stop
sign
grow
larger
as
she
approached
behind
her
she
could
almost
feel
the
lighted
rectangle
of
the
living
room
window
seven
stories
up
trained
on
her
like
a
gunsight
the
dividers
between
the
panes
acting
as
the
crosshairs
except
now
there
was
no
one
to
look
through
it
she
crossed
the
street
forever
and
reached
the
did
you
follow
him
last
night
christopher
pushed
his
hair
back
from
his
face
and
took
a
bite
of
mutton
before
he
answered
because
he
told
us
he
was
a
king
he
said
but
what
business
is
that
of
yours
christopher
shrugged
none
really
for
the
queen
will
seemed
about
to
say
something
christopher
looked
at
him
and
he
subsided
then
oh
why
not
he
said
aye
we
ll
let
everyone
in
london
in
on
the
secret
we
ll
all
be
conspirators
together
you
heard
of
course
that
someone
tried
to
kill
the
queen
yesterday
aye
tom
said
but
the
assassin
shot
an
actor
dressed
to
look
like
her
instead
his
friend
looked
a
little
surprised
and
tom
grinned
he
might
not
be
an
agent
of
the
queen
but
he
had
his
own
ways
of
gathering
information
will
and
i
were
there
christopher
said
surprising
tom
in
turn
queen
elizabeth
had
apparently
thought
it
amusing
to
trade
places
with
an
actor
in
a
masque
the
thought
saved
her
life
the
actor
was
killed
and
the
man
who
shot
her
captured
but
he
refuses
to
name
his
accomplices
but
surely
he
ca
nt
remain
silent
they
ve
tortured
him
he
s
said
nothing
but
the
odd
thing
one
of
several
odd
things
really
is
that
he
seemed
to
expect
the
audience
to
rise
up
against
the
queen
he
had
no
idea
how
much
her
subjects
love
her
and
the
other
odd
things
arthur
was
on
the
stage
with
him
the
assassin
brought
him
out
and
introduced
him
as
the
new
king
i
do
nt
know
if
the
plot
was
arthur
s
idea
arthur
he
would
nt
would
nt
he
well
perhaps
not
then
he
was
used
by
these
other
men
who
intended
to
put
him
on
the
throne
but
control
him
the
way
they
might
control
a
puppet
how
do
you
know
there
are
other
men
involved
perhaps
the
assassin
was
acting
alone
christopher
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
again
his
friend
had
been
forthcoming
so
far
tom
thought
he
had
been
surprised
at
how
much
kit
was
willing
to
he
start
to
dissemble
it
s
complicated
christopher
said
finally
i
saw
a
man
die
over
this
believe
me
there
are
others
involved
and
next
time
they
may
succeed
in
killing
the
queen
so
you
see
how
important
it
is
to
find
arthur
tom
nodded
now
that
you
know
will
said
will
you
help
us
of
course
tom
said
surprised
no
matter
how
open
kit
became
he
would
never
in
his
life
think
to
ask
for
help
he
began
to
warm
to
this
man
of
course
i
will
what
can
i
do
tell
us
if
you
see
arthur
will
said
try
to
keep
him
in
sight
if
he
comes
back
to
the
tavern
he
has
the
most
extraordinary
smile
tom
thought
aye
he
said
but
i
fear
he
s
gone
to
this
new
land
that
he
s
beyond
our
finding
him
christopher
returned
thought
over
what
he
had
said
feeling
faintly
surprised
that
he
had
told
tom
as
much
as
he
had
he
wondered
why
he
had
done
so
did
he
think
he
had
to
match
will
s
openness
with
his
own
but
will
had
been
right
tom
might
prove
useful
always
assuming
of
course
that
tom
stayed
in
this
world
and
did
not
follow
his
fancies
to
lubberland
or
wherever
he
thought
he
had
been
still
he
was
glad
that
he
had
not
mentioned
robert
poley
it
was
important
that
no
one
know
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
engaged
him
and
especially
important
that
will
not
discover
it
will
might
tell
his
brother
geoffrey
and
geoffrey
geoffrey
knew
something
he
should
nt
of
that
christopher
felt
certain
people
were
still
awake
at
the
palace
standing
and
talking
in
low
voices
candles
guttered
in
iron
coronas
he
heard
his
name
called
by
several
people
all
courtiers
he
barely
knew
there
had
been
fresh
gossip
since
the
drama
of
the
shaken
and
anxious
to
share
what
they
heard
sir
francis
walsingham
the
queen
s
principal
secretary
was
dead
fortunately
for
him
he
had
been
told
nothing
about
the
danger
the
queen
had
faced
and
so
had
died
peacefully
walsingham
dead
christopher
thought
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
to
his
room
he
was
too
tired
to
take
it
in
but
the
confusion
at
court
meant
that
he
would
not
be
expected
to
do
any
work
for
a
few
days
he
could
find
a
quiet
place
and
think
about
what
he
had
learned
the
next
day
he
made
his
way
to
the
gallery
and
sat
on
one
of
the
cushioned
benches
overlooking
the
courtyard
morning
light
came
in
through
the
leaded
windows
illuminating
each
of
the
courtiers
passing
in
colors
as
bright
as
an
old
manuscript
did
walsingham
s
death
mean
that
his
work
here
was
finished
he
knew
almost
nothing
about
poley
s
arrangements
with
the
principal
secretary
but
if
he
discovered
the
plotters
he
would
certainly
be
kept
on
gratefully
rewarded
by
whoever
work
quickly
though
before
someone
newly
come
to
power
decided
he
was
un
necessary
well
then
what
did
he
know
a
man
had
shot
someone
he
believed
to
be
the
queen
an
assassin
who
acted
for
a
group
of
conspirators
or
did
he
what
if
tom
of
all
people
had
been
right
what
if
the
man
had
acted
on
his
own
behalf
what
evidence
did
he
have
for
a
conspiracy
after
all
besides
the
fact
that
poley
had
told
him
there
was
one
of
course
there
was
the
note
he
had
seen
in
the
black
boar
and
a
note
implied
traffic
between
two
people
at
least
all
is
in
readiness
it
had
said
our
king
awaits
but
it
had
been
poley
who
had
shown
him
the
note
nay
that
was
ridiculous
why
would
poley
fabricate
a
conspiracy
to
make
himself
more
useful
to
the
principal
secretary
the
queen
faced
enough
dangers
as
he
had
seen
without
having
to
invent
any
had
taken
part
in
it
outside
and
sat
down
on
the
top
step
he
reached
for
jada
s
hand
and
together
they
leaned
back
against
the
warm
red
bricks
of
the
church
they
smiled
as
mr
freean
much
and
who
had
died
a
war
hero
they
listened
to
the
pulsating
music
of
ravensfield
entertaining
its
young
sustaining
its
old
and
calling
home
all
its
departed
it
was
more
than
music
to
dance
to
ravensfield
music
it
was
a
paean
of
honor
to
the
departed
and
for
the
living
a
reinforcement
of
their
pact
with
life
listening
to
the
surging
music
jada
could
almost
understand
how
it
would
be
possible
for
a
dancing
couple
to
forget
a
baby
sleeping
in
the
cloakroom
as
the
silver
moon
slid
across
the
night
sky
the
ravensfield
orchestra
played
slower
and
slower
all
too
soon
the
melody
of
the
last
dance
began
masie
macentire
spoke
softly
into
the
microphone
and
now
goodnight
sweetheart
in
the
pale
moonlit
night
jada
starr
and
mr
free
man
sat
out
the
last
dance
on
the
top
step
of
the
church
you
would
have
liked
my
boy
mr
freeman
said
looking
into
the
night
and
too
liked
you
very
much
he
sighed
then
turned
to
jada
cute
as
a
bug
you
are
in
your
aunt
s
old
party
dress
thank
you
mr
freeman
jada
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulder
i
know
i
would
have
liked
your
son
i
would
have
liked
him
very
much
that
fourth
of
july
night
in
ravensfield
jada
would
remember
always
she
could
have
sat
forever
on
the
church
steps
listening
to
the
haunting
melodies
of
the
orchestra
listening
to
the
gentle
memories
of
mr
freeman
because
starr
freeman
was
there
with
her
but
day
follows
night
and
in
ravensfield
it
was
a
rainy
day
rain
fell
for
five
continuous
days
uncle
mac
fussed
with
his
machinery
in
the
quonset
and
looked
through
mail
order
catalogs
with
aunt
may
con
tented
when
will
this
rain
stop
jada
asked
in
exasperation
she
sat
on
aunt
may
s
bed
looking
out
the
misty
bedroom
window
only
the
red
poppies
pushing
gray
world
soon
uncle
mac
answered
as
soon
as
the
alfalfa
understands
it
is
to
start
growing
again
and
the
green
wheat
decides
it
is
time
to
ripen
it
will
stop
soon
the
first
day
of
the
rain
aunt
may
asked
jada
to
bring
out
her
white
satin
sheets
and
her
fuchsia
bed
jacket
and
to
wash
her
hair
after
the
hair
washing
jada
had
to
change
aunt
may
and
herself
but
aunt
may
looked
divine
just
in
time
for
visitors
in
fact
since
all
the
visitors
arrived
wet
and
wrinkled
aunt
may
looked
better
than
anyone
jada
collected
umbrellas
at
the
front
door
and
kept
the
floor
mop
handy
she
served
cupcakes
and
posturn
and
she
sat
next
to
uncle
mac
and
enjoyed
the
company
aunt
may
was
genuinely
entertaining
and
she
had
the
visitors
in
fine
spirits
before
they
left
whether
they
had
their
first
crop
of
hay
stacked
or
not
you
are
a
vision
of
springtime
may
bishop
in
no
time
at
all
no
time
at
all
i
am
happy
you
think
so
aunt
may
murmured
the
freemans
arrived
somber
and
wet
with
neither
umbrellas
nor
galoshes
jada
followed
them
with
the
mop
to
aunt
may
s
bedroom
it
has
been
sixteen
years
may
mrs
freeman
said
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
she
propped
her
patent
leather
purse
on
her
lap
then
folded
her
arms
over
it
and
it
seems
like
only
yesterday
aunt
may
sank
into
her
pillows
uncle
mac
and
mr
freeman
nodded
their
heads
solemnly
i
relived
it
all
again
at
the
dance
the
other
night
mr
freeman
said
seemed
as
if
young
jada
here
was
your
rosanne
she
looks
just
like
her
she
does
nt
look
a
thing
like
rosanne
mrs
free
man
said
emphatically
tall
with
frizzy
hair
i
have
been
telling
hyram
that
for
two
days
but
he
just
keeps
thinking
it
was
rosanne
she
looked
at
jada
and
frowned
she
has
rosanne
s
ways
uncle
mac
said
kindly
rosanne
was
a
beauty
mrs
freeman
declared
she
heaved
a
sigh
and
continued
with
difficulty
they
were
so
much
in
love
and
so
young
with
so
much
to
look
forward
to
how
could
the
good
lord
let
it
happen
to
our
starr
mrs
freeman
wept
openly
and
although
she
accepted
the
handkerchief
mr
freeman
offered
she
twisted
it
between
her
fingers
and
let
her
tears
roll
down
her
thin
cheeks
mr
freeman
cleared
his
throat
is
she
coming
home
this
summer
we
always
look
forward
to
her
visits
just
as
if
she
were
our
own
daughter
we
have
always
considered
her
our
daughter
mrs
freeman
added
starr
would
have
wanted
us
to
she
is
coming
home
the
end
of
this
month
uncle
mac
said
with
her
husband
and
children
you
understand
aunt
a
fine
man
but
there
will
never
be
any
one
except
starr
of
course
we
know
she
was
heartbroken
mrs
freeman
said
but
what
else
could
a
young
girl
do
trying
to
piece
her
life
together
oh
it
was
a
shock
that
telegram
she
continued
i
will
never
forget
it
i
was
home
alone
when
mr
blakely
called
from
town
i
knew
what
was
in
that
telegram
before
he
read
it
he
knew
also
and
his
voice
was
trembling
he
said
i
am
afraid
i
have
bad
news
for
you
mrs
freeman
is
your
husband
in
and
i
said
no
mr
blakely
just
read
it
to
me
mr
freeman
reached
over
and
touched
her
hand
and
our
boy
starr
his
voice
was
muffled
his
name
on
a
bronze
monument
in
front
of
the
city
hall
and
a
gold
star
for
our
window
that
is
all
jada
looked
in
anguish
mac
mrs
freeman
and
mr
freeman
all
closed
faces
and
she
realized
that
this
same
conversation
had
been
repeated
before
this
same
scene
played
before
many
many
times
she
slid
from
her
chair
excuse
me
she
whispered
leaving
the
room
no
one
familiar
types
of
stores
woven
rugs
silver
concha
belts
turquoise
jewelry
and
pottery
for
money
to
buy
everything
from
food
and
tires
to
tools
and
seed
it
was
hard
to
imagine
growing
things
here
july
thought
as
he
looked
out
the
window
the
land
was
dry
and
harsh
yet
mysteriously
beautiful
as
the
light
fell
across
the
country
the
mountains
appeared
sharp
against
the
sky
the
light
kept
changing
the
mountains
buff
colored
minutes
before
began
to
turn
a
dusky
mauve
the
van
wound
through
canyons
dotted
with
pinon
trees
then
up
again
to
higher
land
where
strange
rock
formations
writhed
out
of
the
ground
like
fantastic
beasts
occasional
road
signs
indicated
a
creek
or
a
wash
which
putnam
explained
was
a
dried
up
streambed
in
this
empty
land
that
seemed
to
have
no
boundaries
the
natural
features
became
the
reference
points
and
the
names
for
places
there
was
a
chaco
wash
and
a
tsaya
wash
and
a
red
wash
and
places
with
strange
sounding
names
like
tsoodzil
that
linked
the
land
to
the
the
children
that
new
world
was
a
white
man
s
name
for
a
very
old
place
this
world
had
been
here
long
long
before
the
spanish
and
the
europeans
came
to
explore
it
a
hogan
putnam
exclaimed
our
first
hogan
we
re
in
navajo
country
for
sure
he
slowed
the
van
down
and
pointed
out
the
window
the
land
fell
away
into
a
shallow
basin
a
dirt
road
wound
off
toward
a
cluster
of
rocks
that
popped
out
of
the
ground
like
giant
elephant
legs
and
cast
long
shadows
in
the
afternoon
light
where
the
shadows
ended
was
a
dome
shaped
cabin
made
of
logs
putnam
pulled
the
car
to
the
side
of
the
road
so
they
could
have
a
better
look
see
it
s
an
octagon
eight
sides
putnam
said
there
s
the
smoke
hole
in
the
center
no
smoke
though
nobody
home
i
guess
do
the
indians
live
in
them
liberty
asked
yes
town
they
drove
on
more
rocks
with
flat
table
like
surfaces
on
top
climbed
out
of
the
broken
land
we
re
getting
closer
to
tres
arroyos
you
can
tell
by
all
these
mesas
put
said
what
are
mesas
charly
asked
these
rock
formations
put
pointed
out
the
window
they
look
like
big
flat
tabletops
lifting
high
up
from
the
ground
some
of
them
are
so
big
that
whole
villages
are
built
on
top
of
them
the
navajos
live
in
the
hogans
they
re
basically
loners
some
of
them
still
herd
sheep
in
the
lonely
stretches
of
high
desert
country
the
pueblos
live
in
the
rock
and
adobe
villages
often
tending
communally
owned
fields
suddenly
putnam
swerved
the
van
sharply
onto
the
shoulder
of
the
road
what
in
the
world
shrieked
madeline
a
ruin
right
on
schedule
ruin
you
nearly
wrecked
the
car
and
ruined
your
family
madeline
was
irritated
look
it
is
a
ruin
oh
gasped
liberty
in
front
of
them
was
an
expanse
of
rugged
broken
land
that
ended
at
a
red
rock
cliff
face
under
its
overhang
a
jumble
of
large
cubes
seemed
to
hang
in
midair
and
between
the
cubes
were
many
levels
connected
by
terraces
it
s
an
anasazi
cliff
dwelling
madeline
s
voice
swelled
with
delight
she
rolled
down
the
window
and
stuck
her
head
out
a
genuine
ruin
and
a
lovely
one
at
that
they
drove
closer
and
got
out
of
the
car
to
get
a
better
look
compared
to
the
scale
of
the
cliff
and
the
immense
arch
of
the
sky
the
pueblo
looked
like
a
miniature
village
constructed
from
children
s
building
blocks
the
simple
geometric
shapes
were
arranged
in
a
pleasing
pattern
of
terraces
that
followed
the
contours
of
the
land
and
the
mountains
can
we
go
explore
liberty
asked
then
all
the
twins
began
clamoring
please
please
we
want
s
getting
late
madeline
said
yes
it
is
turning
chilly
and
we
do
have
more
driving
to
do
put
added
charly
said
the
final
words
it
s
educational
part
of
the
southwest
curriculum
the
four
twins
said
at
once
and
looked
at
zanny
on
all
their
adventures
zanny
dreamed
up
special
courses
to
fit
the
particular
place
the
starbucks
were
living
this
time
it
would
be
the
southwest
curriculum
with
the
focus
on
the
native
americans
of
the
four
corners
area
the
region
where
the
corners
of
new
mexico
colorado
utah
and
arizona
came
together
this
was
the
land
where
the
pueblos
and
the
navajo
still
lived
where
the
anasazi
known
as
the
ancient
ones
had
lived
and
then
mysteriously
vanished
almost
two
hun
dred
years
before
columbus
arrived
in
the
west
indies
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
zanny
zanny
looked
at
madeline
madeline
looked
at
put
and
they
all
started
line
over
broken
ground
which
was
dotted
with
silvery
green
sagebrush
and
spires
of
bristling
cactus
toward
the
cliff
that
seemed
to
change
color
in
the
setting
sun
the
rock
turned
from
soft
red
to
rose
to
deep
amber
and
finally
to
dusky
purple
the
family
stood
in
the
lavender
shadows
of
the
overhanging
cliff
they
had
climbed
up
onto
a
terrace
and
although
they
were
cold
not
one
twin
dared
show
it
it
was
a
strange
place
this
ruin
the
small
windows
pierced
in
the
two
foot
thick
adobe
walls
seemed
like
ghost
eyes
from
a
time
long
long
ago
what
had
the
ghost
eyes
seen
children
playing
on
these
terraces
what
a
neat
place
to
live
so
high
up
you
could
reach
out
your
window
and
touch
a
cloud
it
s
like
a
city
in
the
sky
the
telepathic
channels
were
busy
as
the
children
tried
to
imagine
how
people
had
lived
in
this
odd
place
look
over
there
kids
zanny
said
pointing
to
a
high
see
those
pictures
on
the
rock
oh
yeah
july
said
softly
almost
straight
above
them
carved
into
the
rock
was
a
series
of
shapes
some
simple
geometric
ones
others
the
contours
of
animals
i
see
a
frog
molly
exclaimed
i
think
i
see
the
hearing
chamber
stately
stone
and
warm
dark
wood
seats
upholstered
in
dark
faux
leather
bithras
allen
and
myself
deliberately
dressed
in
conservative
martian
fashions
alice
on
her
freshly
polished
carriage
with
our
synthetic
clothing
and
unaltered
physiques
we
must
have
resembled
hicks
in
a
litvid
comedy
but
we
were
greeted
respectfully
by
five
senators
from
the
standing
committee
on
solar
system
and
nearearth
space
light
conversation
with
the
senators
and
a
few
of
their
staff
the
air
was
polite
but
formal
again
i
sensed
something
amiss
as
did
bithras
whose
nostrils
flared
as
he
took
his
seat
behind
a
long
maple
table
allen
leaned
over
and
asked
me
why
are
nt
we
testifying
before
the
whole
committee
i
did
not
know
i
sat
to
the
left
of
bithras
in
a
hard
wooden
chair
allen
sat
to
his
right
alice
was
connected
to
the
senate
thinker
harold
s
who
had
served
the
senate
for
sixty
years
the
gallery
was
empty
obviously
this
would
be
a
closed
hearing
senator
kay
juarez
sommers
of
new
mexico
chair
of
the
committee
gaveled
the
hearing
into
order
i
welcome
our
distinguished
guests
from
mars
you
do
nt
know
how
odd
that
is
for
an
old
terrie
like
myself
to
say
even
today
maybe
i
need
some
enhancements
to
the
imagination
certainly
some
of
my
colleagues
think
so
she
when
appearance
seemed
an
arbitrary
choice
small
and
wiry
clean
simple
features
smooth
voiced
dressing
hard
in
blacks
and
grays
senator
juarez
sommers
had
not
chosen
any
easy
roads
in
her
life
and
she
had
eschewed
obvious
transform
designs
also
attending
the
hearing
today
were
senators
john
mendoza
of
utah
tall
chocolate
skinned
severely
handsome
and
stocky
senator
david
wang
of
california
white
blond
with
golden
skin
a
fairly
obvious
transform
and
senator
joe
kim
of
green
idaho
of
middle
height
grayhaired
wearing
an
expression
of
perpetual
suspicion
or
perhaps
it
was
discernment
mr
majumdar
as
you
can
see
this
is
a
closed
hearing
juarez
sommers
began
we
ve
chosen
key
members
of
the
standing
committee
to
hear
your
testimony
we
ll
speak
directly
since
our
time
is
limited
we
re
curious
as
to
how
much
progress
mars
will
make
toward
unification
in
the
next
five
years
we
face
major
obstacles
bithras
said
not
all
of
them
caused
bithras
explained
the
complex
interactions
of
binding
multiple
finances
and
politics
martian
resources
were
about
two
percent
developed
earth
based
corporations
with
bm
subsidiaries
and
lunar
based
bms
controlled
fifteen
percent
of
martian
capital
and
ten
percent
of
developed
resources
mars
based
bms
frequently
sought
capital
from
triple
sources
off
mars
establishing
temporary
liaisons
even
giving
the
outside
sources
some
say
in
their
internal
affairs
it
seemed
everybody
had
a
finger
in
the
martian
pie
organizing
so
many
disparate
interests
was
more
than
difficult
it
was
nightmarish
and
it
was
made
worse
by
the
reluctance
of
healthy
and
profitable
bms
to
submit
to
central
authority
do
martian
bms
feel
they
have
inalienable
rights
corporate
rights
as
p
it
were
no
matter
what
the
needs
of
their
individual
members
asked
senator
mendoza
of
utah
nothing
so
arrogant
bithras
said
binding
multiples
operate
more
like
groups
of
small
businesses
and
families
than
worker
owned
earthstyle
corporations
family
members
are
all
shareholders
but
they
can
not
sell
their
shares
to
any
outside
special
election
or
birth
transfer
through
marriage
or
election
removes
you
from
one
bm
and
places
you
in
another
within
the
family
there
is
exchange
of
work
credits
only
no
money
as
such
all
investments
outside
the
family
are
directed
by
the
syndic
s
financial
managers
the
senators
appeared
bored
bithras
concluded
quickly
i
m
sure
you
re
familiar
with
the
principles
they
re
the
same
on
the
moon
and
in
the
belts
as
well
being
aware
of
a
pattern
should
imply
being
able
to
change
it
said
mendoza
our
witness
has
just
admitted
to
us
that
there
is
reluctance
said
senator
wang
of
california
glancing
at
his
colleagues
with
raised
eye
brows
mr
majumdar
s
own
binding
multiple
has
been
reluctant
to
cooperate
with
attempts
to
unify
said
juarez
sommers
perhaps
he
can
give
us
insight
into
both
the
reluctance
and
the
proposed
nurturing
of
a
new
social
pattern
bithras
tilted
his
head
to
one
reluctant
witness
we
have
worked
long
and
hard
to
determine
our
own
destiny
we
behave
as
strong
willed
individuals
within
an
atmosphere
determined
by
mutual
advantage
we
are
naturally
not
inclined
to
place
our
destinies
and
lives
in
the
hands
of
agencies
who
do
not
answer
directly
to
us
your
binding
multiples
have
lived
under
this
illusion
for
decades
said
senator
joe
kim
of
green
idaho
are
you
telling
us
this
is
truly
how
mars
works
each
individual
interacting
directly
with
family
authorities
no
bithras
said
surely
you
have
a
system
of
justice
that
all
bms
subscribe
to
how
do
you
treat
your
untherapied
your
ill
adapted
have
nt
we
strayed
from
the
subject
a
bit
senator
bithras
asked
smiling
humor
me
kim
said
looking
down
at
the
slate
before
him
iithras
humored
him
they
have
rights
if
their
maladaptation
is
severe
their
families
persuade
them
to
seek
aid
therapy
if
that
seems
crime
transcends
family
boundaries
they
can
be
brought
before
council
judges
but
martians
are
not
enamored
of
therapy
mendoza
said
staring
at
us
one
by
one
some
of
us
in
utah
share
their
doubts
we
do
nt
embrace
the
concept
as
a
fashion
bithras
clarified
neither
do
we
oppose
it
on
principle
we
think
perhaps
an
improvement
in
the
mentality
of
martians
as
individuals
might
lead
to
a
greater
acceptance
of
more
efficient
social
organization
juarez
sommers
said
glancing
at
mendoza
with
some
irritation
the
senator
is
privileged
to
think
that
bithras
said
quietly
that
line
of
questioning
was
dropped
the
senators
paused
for
a
few
seconds
tuning
in
to
harold
s
perhaps
then
resumed
the
questioning
you
re
no
doubt
aware
that
the
major
alliances
of
earth
have
expressed
unhappiness
with
martian
backwardness
juarez
sommers
said
there
s
our
tongues
in
the
company
of
strangers
referring
to
our
love
of
which
they
were
ignorant
but
this
time
it
seemed
the
word
had
slipped
out
of
nina
s
mouth
without
any
intention
of
me
to
bring
up
the
izmailovi
zoo
what
could
i
be
thinking
of
afterward
she
told
me
that
she
had
been
so
shocked
by
her
father
s
execution
that
she
could
not
speak
for
a
month
it
was
then
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
return
to
poland
it
was
in
and
everyone
predicted
that
after
the
war
poland
would
he
under
russian
influence
she
hoped
that
they
would
open
the
ix
rders
and
allow
her
to
return
to
the
land
of
her
birth
i
found
it
strange
that
she
should
see
fit
to
tell
me
this
it
amounted
after
all
to
an
admission
that
she
had
had
no
intention
of
waiting
for
me
i
said
nothing
what
did
it
matter
now
exactly
when
she
had
decided
to
break
off
relations
with
me
suddenly
she
asked
me
about
galina
nikolayevna
and
yefim
i
was
very
surprised
i
had
no
idea
that
she
knew
about
the
episode
in
question
the
miserable
meeting
on
my
way
to
the
front
took
on
a
grudge
she
had
not
hesitated
to
take
her
revenge
on
me
even
though
i
was
on
my
way
from
siberia
to
the
western
front
she
had
not
even
thought
that
i
deserved
to
know
what
i
was
being
punished
for
and
she
still
had
the
nerve
to
blame
me
for
not
taking
the
child
s
feelings
into
account
i
said
nothing
i
adopted
her
own
superior
attitude
toward
sins
made
obsolete
by
the
law
of
limitations
she
spoke
about
galina
nikolayevna
and
yefim
as
if
they
were
characters
in
a
story
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
they
were
mentioned
only
in
passing
in
order
to
clarify
a
point
why
she
had
considered
that
she
was
entitled
to
plan
her
return
to
poland
without
taking
me
into
account
there
was
a
relaxed
expression
on
her
face
but
she
could
nt
fool
me
the
tension
was
apparent
in
her
fingers
which
were
tightly
locked
together
she
was
pleased
with
the
way
the
meeting
had
gone
she
had
expected
worse
i
had
not
been
aggressive
except
for
the
remark
about
the
monkey
in
the
moscow
zoo
which
seemed
to
her
completely
out
of
context
nina
saw
that
she
could
rely
on
me
there
was
no
danger
of
anonymous
letters
to
her
husband
from
my
quarter
nor
did
my
occupation
pose
a
threat
a
translator
from
hebrew
into
russian
was
not
likely
to
make
a
lot
of
enemies
and
nevertheless
there
was
a
feeling
of
unfinished
business
in
the
air
the
meeting
had
not
solved
anything
we
had
seen
each
other
learned
what
had
changed
and
what
had
not
changed
and
so
we
were
still
tied
together
by
an
indissoluble
bond
in
a
moment
of
goodwill
after
we
had
spoken
kindly
of
departed
friends
i
asked
her
and
now
what
for
a
moment
she
thought
that
i
wanted
to
set
a
date
for
another
meeting
she
embarked
on
a
long
explanation
of
all
the
difficulties
in
which
this
would
involve
her
i
cut
her
short
this
was
not
what
i
had
had
in
her
free
of
me
entirely
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
said
this
formality
did
not
bother
me
in
the
least
but
in
her
world
among
the
people
she
knew
nina
looked
at
me
coldly
our
marriage
is
not
valid
she
said
and
there
is
thus
no
need
for
a
divorce
for
a
moment
i
was
full
of
rage
what
do
you
mean
not
valid
because
we
never
got
married
according
to
the
law
of
moses
and
israel
yes
in
other
words
from
their
point
of
view
you
are
permitted
even
to
a
cohen
and
i
simply
never
existed
at
all
my
irony
made
no
impression
on
her
but
when
i
added
in
that
case
why
was
it
necessary
to
sweep
me
under
the
rug
she
tensed
although
she
held
her
tongue
until
you
learned
the
laws
you
must
have
entangled
yourself
in
a
pretty
web
of
lies
that
grew
more
indifferent
from
one
moment
to
the
next
and
why
should
i
have
lied
so
that
people
would
think
you
were
a
widow
to
avoid
complications
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
never
lied
i
was
certain
that
you
had
been
executed
she
said
calmly
you
were
certain
i
even
saw
a
certificate
confirming
it
a
certificate
who
could
have
shown
you
any
such
certifi
cate
leopold
the
pole
i
never
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
leopold
sherrer
he
was
the
editor
of
a
polish
journal
a
tall
frail
man
with
sparse
hair
and
skinny
arms
and
exceptionally
refined
manners
interested
in
yiddish
literature
he
would
visit
the
editorial
office
rummage
about
in
the
archives
and
engage
in
polemics
with
the
poets
once
he
came
down
to
the
printing
press
to
look
for
something
since
we
had
already
met
at
minkovsy
s
we
got
habit
to
drop
in
to
visit
me
we
became
friends
to
the
extent
that
it
was
possible
to
make
friends
with
a
stranger
in
those
suspicious
days
he
flattered
me
calling
me
the
philosopher
of
the
lead
cauldron
and
this
was
nothing
to
be
sneezed
at
for
he
himself
was
a
graduate
of
the
institute
of
philosophy
the
polish
speakers
were
lavish
in
their
praises
his
essays
on
aesthetics
were
philosophical
gems
in
the
course
of
time
he
fell
into
the
habit
of
accompanying
me
home
he
would
kiss
nina
s
hand
pat
olga
on
the
head
and
take
his
leave
nina
was
truly
lovely
in
those
days
blooming
gay
always
excited
if
she
heard
a
concert
read
a
book
saw
something
in
the
street
she
had
to
share
her
experiences
with
others
leopold
sherrer
would
listen
to
her
and
nod
his
head
he
never
flirted
with
her
he
never
gave
her
admiring
looks
made
bines
said
ya
ll
be
well
camouflaged
with
that
i
ca
nt
go
downtown
without
a
shotgun
rils
said
staring
at
lucy
no
you
should
nt
go
walking
around
town
without
one
that
s
no
good
is
it
rils
looked
at
him
quickly
ya
ca
nt
have
my
shotgun
but
i
ll
see
about
one
bines
said
see
if
i
can
get
you
one
he
said
nothing
more
while
rils
told
his
story
of
being
in
kingston
penitentiary
the
only
problem
now
was
money
could
bines
get
him
some
money
i
do
nt
know
if
i
can
get
ya
no
money
bines
said
but
there
was
all
this
jewellery
that
he
had
he
had
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jewellery
some
and
he
would
give
it
to
bines
for
six
hundred
dollars
do
nt
want
it
jerry
said
sparks
flew
out
of
a
chimney
two
or
three
houses
down
and
snapped
off
in
the
air
a
bargain
a
bargain
rils
said
his
voice
carrying
a
tone
of
being
stung
do
nt
want
it
bines
said
do
nt
trust
me
do
nt
want
it
why
do
nt
you
i
was
your
friend
when
you
needed
one
i
was
there
when
you
needed
me
do
nt
want
it
bines
had
met
him
in
calgary
for
when
you
go
anywhere
in
the
middle
of
the
night
who
do
you
go
to
but
to
those
who
will
have
you
alvin
had
been
going
back
and
forth
carting
things
to
rils
and
the
old
dog
followed
him
up
and
down
stairs
and
now
sat
wagging
its
tail
at
the
door
it
would
hobble
back
downstairs
when
alvin
went
on
it
and
fed
it
toast
and
jam
and
called
it
sugar
foot
and
no
matter
how
deeply
it
slept
once
alvin
left
the
room
it
would
lift
itself
up
and
hobble
behind
him
only
to
lie
down
again
where
alvin
sat
that
the
old
dog
did
this
hopping
along
on
its
lame
feet
and
wagging
its
matted
tail
looking
up
shamefully
from
one
person
to
another
as
if
trying
to
find
a
human
it
could
understand
bothered
bines
that
is
he
could
not
stand
to
think
that
rils
would
torment
alvin
in
front
of
his
old
lame
dog
or
the
dog
in
front
of
alvin
bines
glanced
over
at
lucy
and
then
at
alvin
as
rils
told
a
joke
that
was
not
so
much
off
colour
as
childish
rils
said
he
wanted
to
go
by
christmas
eve
but
he
had
a
few
people
to
take
care
of
and
some
money
to
collect
christmas
eve
rils
said
that
ll
give
us
time
jerry
tossed
his
head
pitifully
looked
up
at
him
thumping
its
tail
downstairs
alvin
begged
bines
to
take
him
away
he
ca
nt
stay
here
alvin
said
you
have
to
take
him
he
s
your
friend
your
friend
your
friend
alvin
was
close
to
tears
and
it
was
sad
to
see
him
crying
in
front
of
his
children
hazel
stood
behind
him
now
and
could
feel
his
legs
trembling
as
he
tried
to
smile
the
old
dog
came
over
and
sat
near
them
and
gave
a
sad
whine
when
it
yawned
bines
sighed
and
looked
at
lucy
she
too
seemed
to
be
worried
because
the
man
upstairs
was
crazy
he
keeps
talking
about
going
out
and
killing
an
old
woman
or
two
he
says
the
world
would
be
better
off
without
a
few
old
women
or
about
getting
the
pillars
back
i
do
nt
know
why
he
talks
like
that
for
she
said
and
we
have
a
house
filled
with
little
kids
here
if
bines
said
as
if
to
reassure
them
well
that
s
all
right
for
you
to
say
but
it
s
us
who
ll
be
dead
alvin
said
jesus
we
have
little
girls
here
alvin
whispered
i
might
turn
him
in
is
what
i
might
do
no
bines
said
go
get
him
tell
him
to
come
with
me
bines
once
again
felt
the
power
of
his
own
personality
surge
through
him
because
of
what
he
had
just
said
but
he
also
had
nowhere
to
take
rils
he
had
burned
his
camp
for
one
reason
only
so
he
would
have
no
hiding
place
to
offer
now
to
protect
others
he
felt
he
must
find
one
rils
made
bines
wait
as
he
argued
about
leaving
no
i
do
nt
want
you
to
go
it
is
nt
me
alvin
said
but
you
d
be
safer
with
jerry
they
came
down
the
stairs
twenty
minutes
sheet
and
carrying
two
teacups
in
his
hand
to
take
into
the
kitchen
like
a
man
who
does
nt
want
some
guest
and
makes
the
appropriate
gesture
to
clean
up
in
front
of
him
when
he
has
hope
enough
in
his
leaving
rils
expression
had
changed
he
kept
looking
at
bines
one
moment
and
then
looking
away
abruptly
whenever
bines
glanced
at
him
he
would
notice
rils
eyes
flit
past
him
as
cold
in
their
blueness
as
bines
eyes
ever
were
it
was
a
look
of
absolute
certainty
of
his
betrayal
at
the
hands
of
others
and
instead
of
making
him
afraid
it
gave
him
a
frightening
inquisitorial
appearance
as
if
he
were
keeping
score
bines
called
rils
percy
a
term
of
affection
only
a
few
people
maintained
with
him
and
they
left
and
walked
out
into
the
iron
smelling
snow
their
first
falling
out
had
been
over
the
tractor
trailer
the
man
said
and
now
they
had
come
to
the
second
falling
out
as
soon
as
they
got
outside
you
could
feel
the
dark
the
lumber
sat
off
along
the
wharf
covered
by
snow
all
the
buildings
were
dark
their
slanted
roofs
casting
shadows
on
the
white
earth
as
it
was
when
jerry
was
a
little
boy
the
argument
came
because
mr
rils
wanted
to
rob
mr
pillar
that
was
the
statement
given
by
lucy
savoie
to
constable
petrie
in
her
meeting
with
him
on
january
the
idea
jerry
had
was
to
get
rils
some
money
and
to
get
him
off
said
to
no
one
in
particular
the
other
faculty
members
present
looked
at
him
in
a
way
that
said
so
what
michael
went
to
see
arthur
and
explained
to
him
the
rather
neat
and
profound
role
the
pond
played
in
the
traditions
of
the
campus
it
was
nt
much
in
hundred
feet
long
by
fifty
feet
wide
but
it
was
home
for
little
geezers
with
orange
legs
who
looked
at
michael
when
he
walked
by
and
went
quack
when
he
grinned
and
said
hello
to
them
it
was
also
a
place
for
moonlight
walks
and
tender
thoughts
a
place
where
ten
thousand
engagement
rings
had
been
slipped
over
shaking
fingers
through
the
years
not
to
mention
various
other
assignations
getting
a
little
more
carnal
late
at
night
when
michael
looked
out
his
office
window
he
could
see
the
ducks
on
their
pond
a
block
away
and
often
he
had
found
solace
in
that
when
dealing
with
education
gone
ber
serk
but
guys
like
arthur
j
wilcox
have
no
appreciation
for
tradition
it
s
not
tangible
enough
michael
talked
hard
but
it
did
nt
register
arthur
just
kept
saying
but
michael
we
need
a
new
building
what
about
the
ducks
michael
was
angry
where
will
they
go
are
we
going
to
build
a
new
eighteen
million
dollar
pond
for
either
you
could
see
it
on
his
face
that
and
the
plain
wish
michael
would
just
go
away
and
leave
him
alone
with
his
blueprints
michael
was
pretty
sure
he
would
nt
have
raised
as
much
hell
about
the
duck
pond
as
he
did
if
he
slow
waltz
in
cedar
bend
had
nt
been
half
crazed
with
sorting
out
his
feelings
in
those
days
trying
to
push
jellie
far
back
and
out
of
his
mind
and
failing
in
that
attempt
he
worked
his
way
up
through
the
provost
who
did
nt
understand
ducks
any
better
than
arthur
stomping
past
clarice
s
desk
on
his
way
out
of
the
provost
s
office
he
turned
around
then
talked
with
her
for
a
moment
next
he
made
an
appointment
to
see
the
president
michael
laid
out
his
case
move
the
building
keep
the
duck
pond
the
prez
was
smooth
years
of
dealing
with
demented
faculty
and
recalcitrant
alumni
who
stapled
their
checkbooks
shut
when
they
saw
him
coming
had
provided
him
with
a
sheen
and
style
worthy
your
point
of
view
slithering
public
relations
man
professor
tillman
i
do
understand
your
concerns
tradition
is
important
i
agree
with
you
but
in
evolving
times
we
must
sometimes
cast
off
our
old
traditions
and
establish
new
ones
i
like
ducks
too
in
fact
i
m
a
member
of
ducks
unlimited
and
go
duck
hunting
every
fall
michael
was
wondering
if
in
addition
to
professional
incompetence
and
moral
degradation
presidential
dismemberment
was
sufficient
cause
for
loss
of
tenure
one
of
the
best
students
michael
ever
had
went
on
to
law
school
and
stayed
in
cedar
bend
after
grad
uating
michael
called
him
gene
what
can
be
done
to
prevent
these
clowns
from
pouring
cement
over
ducks
and
tradition
gene
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
radical
causes
so
he
looked
into
it
he
called
back
in
two
days
flat
out
saying
the
building
could
nt
be
halted
by
legal
robert
james
waller
chicanery
something
to
do
with
state
law
and
a
board
of
education
screw
em
gene
i
m
going
to
plant
myself
right
in
the
middle
of
that
pond
and
make
em
drag
me
out
with
chains
michael
i
ll
defend
you
free
of
charge
if
you
do
it
but
you
re
going
to
lose
you
ll
be
better
off
spending
your
time
looking
for
another
home
for
the
ducks
knowing
bureaucrats
hate
bad
publicity
more
than
anything
else
michael
wrote
a
long
article
for
the
university
newspaper
making
what
he
thought
was
a
powerful
and
eloquent
plea
to
save
the
duck
pond
that
started
a
fair
amount
of
debate
over
the
whole
affair
which
drove
arthur
dotty
arthur
went
completely
out
of
his
mind
when
the
longhairs
from
the
student
socialist
brigade
made
up
signs
reading
save
the
ducks
and
began
marching
around
bingley
hall
in
their
birkenstocks
recruiters
from
the
fortune
who
were
on
campus
interviewing
savvy
students
told
arthur
they
were
looking
for
good
corporate
citizens
not
radicals
he
took
them
over
to
the
faculty
club
for
periodic
outbreaks
coming
down
to
us
as
a
result
of
universities
being
too
lenient
in
the
sixties
and
it
would
soon
be
over
afterward
he
took
the
recruiters
to
his
office
unrolled
his
blueprints
and
showed
them
all
the
wonderful
space
the
new
building
would
have
for
interview
rooms
they
liked
that
a
lot
better
the
university
newspaper
was
flooded
for
a
few
days
with
letters
pro
and
con
one
of
the
bookstores
slow
waltz
in
cedar
bend
printed
up
t
shirts
with
the
logo
ducks
not
cement
and
sold
them
for
twelve
dollars
each
proving
once
again
capitalism
can
profit
even
from
the
concerns
of
its
enemies
michael
was
surprised
to
see
jellie
write
a
letter
to
the
newspaper
in
support
of
his
position
it
was
a
nice
letter
and
he
knew
it
probably
caused
her
trouble
at
home
since
jimmy
had
dropped
by
to
talk
with
him
about
the
issue
and
seemed
utterly
amazed
or
perhaps
bewildered
that
michael
could
get
so
worked
up
over
eight
or
ten
ducks
but
nobody
except
michael
and
the
earthmoving
machinery
was
carted
into
position
on
the
back
of
big
muddy
trucks
gambling
on
having
a
mild
winter
the
contractors
would
begin
digging
on
the
following
monday
michael
was
sure
the
tame
ducks
would
nt
know
how
to
handle
the
filling
of
their
pond
and
contacted
the
humane
society
he
and
the
society
put
a
notice
in
the
paper
saying
anyone
who
wanted
to
help
in
getting
the
ducks
moved
should
show
up
early
saturday
morning
and
be
prepared
to
get
wet
light
frost
lay
upon
the
grass
of
autumn
when
michael
rode
the
shadow
through
early
light
and
would
be
better
off
auditioning
with
barnum
and
bailey
than
trying
to
go
to
i
u
but
i
was
not
in
the
college
advisement
business
thank
god

said
macguire
in
a
deep
voice
he
tilted
his
head
and
eyed
greer
lovingly

laughter
erupted
from
the
gallery
miss

protested
greer
with
a
shake
of
her
straight
perfectly

blond
hair

opened
his

wide
at
greer
and
she
tsked
miss
dawson
miss
ferrell
gestured
to
greer
to
continue
greer

sigh

worthy
of
any
martyr

year

macguire

sloped
downward
i

snapped
miss

two
more
people
up
here
and
heather
coopersmith
what
school
interview
do
you
want
to
role

julian
julian
shuffled
between
the
desks
he
flopped
into
the
chair
formerly
occupied
by
macguire
ran
his
hand
nervously
through
his
mowed
hair
and
said
cornell
for
food
science
all
right
said
miss
ferrell
heather
she
said
to
au
drey
s
daughter
a
dark
haired
girl
with
her
mother
s
face
pinktinted
glasses
and
thin
pale
lips
let
him
ask
the
questions
this
is
not
fair
greer
dawson
was
miffed
i
did
nt
really
get
a
chance
that
s
true
she
did
nt
piped
up
her
father
you
will
you
will
said
miss
ferrell
dismissively
this
is
a
learning
experience
for
everybody
but
the
period
s
almost
over
greer
cried
miss
ferrell
opened
her
eyes
wide
the
sherbet
colored
dress
trembled
sit
down
greer
all
right
about
cornell
from
the
gallery
came
the
cry
ask
her
about
home
ec
can
i
learn
to
be
a
smart
caterer
here
julian
flushed
a
painful
shade
my
heart
turned
over
julian
touched
his
tongue
to
his
top
lip
i
do
nt
want
to
do
this
now
the
exasperated
miss
ferrell
surrendered
all
right
go
hack
to
your
desks
everybody
during
the
ensuing
chairscraping
and
body
squishing
she
said
people
do
you
think
this
is
some
kind
of
joke
she
put
her
hands
on
her
sherbet
clad
hips
i
m
trying
to
help
you
she
panned
the
classroom
she
looked
like
a
parisian
model
who
had
been
told
to
do
peeved
and
the
class
was
taking
her
about
that
seriously
to
my
great
relief
the
bell
rang
miss
ferrell
called
out
okay
drafts
of
personal
essays
before
you
leave
people
i
fled
to
a
corner
to
avoid
the
press
of
jostling
teenage
ferrell
was
slapping
papers
around
on
her
desk
looking
thoroughly
disgusted
quel
dommage
i
said
approaching
her
what
a
pity
oh
i
did
nt
see
you
here
she
riffled
papers
on
top
of
her
roll
book
it
s
always
like
this
until
a
few
days
before
the
deadlines
what
can
i
help
you
with
did
you
come
to
see
me
there
s
no
french
club
today
no
i
was
here
to
see
the
headmaster
forgive
me
i
just
wanted
to
drop
in
because
actually
arch
loves
french
club
but
he
s
having
trouble
with
his
schoolwork
she
looked
up
quickly
did
you
hear
about
this
morning
she
drew
back
her
tiny
body
framed
by
a
rumpled
poster
of
the
eiffel
tower
on
one
side
and
a
framed
picture
of
the
arc
de
triomphe
on
the
other
when
i
shook
my
head
she
walked
with
a
tick
tock
of
little
heels
over
to
the
door
and
closed
it
yes
i
said
mr
perkins
told
me
about
arch
about
his
academic
and
social
problems
come
to
think
of
it
he
d
only
mentioned
the
schoolwork
mess
did
he
tell
you
about
this
morning
no
i
said
carefully
just
that
arch
was
flunking
a
class
just
this
is
worse
than
that
worse
miss
ferrell
eyed
me
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
judge
whether
i
could
take
whatever
it
was
she
had
to
say
i
asked
what
happened
to
arch
this
morning
we
had
an
assembly
the
student
body
needed
to
know
about
keith
her
abrupt
tone
betrayed
no
feeling
when
it
was
over
i
m
sorry
to
say
arch
had
a
rather
strenuous
disagreement
with
someone
i
closed
my
eyes
for
being
basically
a
kind
and
mature
kid
arch
seemed
to
be
getting
into
quite
a
few
disagreements
lately
i
wondered
what
do
you
know
we
ve
just
had
someone
throw
a
rock
through
one
of
our
windows
and
maybe
later
arch
came
and
told
me
he
d
gotten
into
a
fight
with
a
seventh
grader
a
boy
who
is
frequently
in
trouble
the
other
boy
apparently
said
keith
was
a
tattler
puzzling
most
seventhgraders
do
nt
even
know
seniors
is
that
all
no
when
arch
arrived
at
his
locker
he
found
a
nasty
surprise
i
went
to
check
and
there
was
something
there
what
you
d
better
let
me
show
you
i
put
my
own
lock
on
the
locker
so
it
should
be
undisturbed
she
peeked
out
into
the
hallway
the
students
had
settled
into
the
new
class
period
so
we
were
able
to
make
it
down
to
the
row
of
making
her
an
offer
sir
robert
came
along
and
fell
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
and
won
her
for
himself
the
colonel
married
guy
s
s
all
there
is
to
it
julian
wondered
he
pictured
the
colonel
and
lady
fontclair
leaving
the
gun
room
arm
in
arm
lady
tarleton
s
insinuating
voice
rang
in
his
ears
touching
is
nt
it
how
fond
they
are
of
one
another
look
here
said
macgregor
when
you
said
you
could
make
a
case
against
all
the
fontclairs
except
hugh
you
ca
nt
have
meant
to
include
lady
fontclair
among
your
suspects
yes
i
did
but
we
ll
pass
over
her
if
you
d
rather
no
let
s
hear
what
you
ve
got
to
say
i
d
just
as
soon
know
the
worst
you
know
i
like
her
too
you
do
nt
like
anybody
and
you
do
nt
trust
anybody
i
ca
nt
afford
no
what
s
the
use
he
rose
would
you
rather
i
put
an
end
to
this
discussion
and
this
visit
look
not
in
so
many
words
then
sit
down
and
behave
yourself
you
ought
to
know
better
than
to
take
to
heart
what
i
say
when
i
m
in
a
temper
julian
smiled
and
sat
down
again
the
case
against
lady
fontclair
it
s
not
a
strong
one
if
sir
robert
is
telling
the
truth
he
left
her
alone
for
only
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
the
period
between
half
past
four
and
six
she
was
nt
entirely
alone
even
for
that
short
time
miss
fontclair
passed
through
the
conservatory
and
spoke
with
her
there
might
just
have
been
time
for
lady
fontclair
to
let
the
girl
in
through
the
conservatory
windows
bring
her
to
my
room
and
kill
her
but
even
assuming
she
could
do
it
it
s
devilish
hard
to
imagine
that
she
would
then
why
not
rule
her
out
well
there
are
some
disturbing
facts
lady
fontclair
says
you
ve
taught
her
a
good
deal
about
medicine
that
means
she
has
some
knowledge
of
anatomy
and
probably
is
nt
as
squeamish
as
most
of
us
would
be
about
cutting
into
human
flesh
and
she
must
know
the
house
and
its
routine
better
than
anyone
it
was
most
likely
she
who
decided
which
room
i
would
have
and
she
repeatedly
urged
hugh
to
take
me
out
for
a
long
ride
late
yesterday
afternoon
clearing
the
way
for
her
to
kill
the
girl
in
your
room
while
you
were
out
kestrel
i
know
her
the
same
as
you
know
your
servant
she
would
nt
do
a
thing
like
that
i
could
imagine
her
firing
a
gun
or
raising
a
knife
against
oh
say
a
housebreaker
who
threatened
her
children
but
if
nothing
else
she
d
never
plan
a
murder
at
bellegarde
and
take
the
risk
that
anyone
in
her
family
or
even
any
of
her
servants
would
take
the
blame
for
it
this
might
not
have
been
a
planned
crime
but
i
admit
what
about
sir
robert
is
he
on
your
list
of
suspects
yes
but
i
grant
you
the
odds
are
lombard
street
to
ninepence
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
he
has
an
alibi
for
most
of
the
period
in
question
assuming
he
and
lady
fontclair
are
nt
lying
to
shield
each
other
and
given
his
sense
of
right
and
justice
it
s
devilish
hard
to
imagine
him
committing
a
crime
like
this
what
is
nt
so
hard
to
imagine
is
that
he
thinks
or
fears
one
of
his
family
is
guilty
the
question
is
does
he
have
a
particular
one
in
mind
and
how
far
would
he
go
to
protect
that
person
i
do
nt
like
to
think
of
the
dilemma
he
d
face
if
he
thought
the
murderer
was
one
of
his
own
family
it
may
be
worse
than
that
you
know
how
could
it
possibly
be
worse
it
may
not
be
only
one
of
them
two
or
more
together
macgregor
clutched
at
his
hair
see
here
kestrel
is
nt
it
just
possible
this
is
all
the
work
of
some
aggrieved
labourer
attacking
the
local
squire
it
happens
you
know
though
it
has
nt
happened
around
alderton
for
lord
knows
how
many
years
i
do
nt
know
much
about
those
sorts
of
rural
conflicts
but
would
nt
there
have
been
a
threatening
note
left
behind
a
demand
for
redress
well
probably
macgregor
heaved
a
sigh
and
resumed
his
pacing
finally
there
s
miss
fontclair
there
s
a
good
deal
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
her
she
admits
to
having
passed
close
to
my
old
room
at
about
twenty
minutes
past
five
she
had
her
sketching
box
with
her
which
contains
a
small
but
very
sharp
knife
that
she
uses
to
sharpen
her
pencils
she
s
been
very
frank
about
all
this
that
may
mean
she
has
nothing
to
hide
it
may
also
mean
she
s
trying
to
disarm
us
with
third
possibility
she
may
be
trying
to
draw
suspicion
away
from
someone
else
who
i
do
nt
know
the
most
obvious
person
he
thought
would
be
lady
fontclair
whom
isabelle
said
she
had
met
in
the
conservatory
when
she
came
in
through
the
french
windows
but
suppose
isabelle
had
been
lying
suppose
lady
fontclair
had
not
been
in
the
conservatory
while
sir
robert
was
gone
suppose
that
instead
of
seeing
her
there
isabelle
had
seen
her
a
little
while
later
outside
julian
s
room
he
went
on
of
course
as
a
suspect
miss
fontclair
presents
a
number
of
problems
she
was
outdoors
for
the
most
of
the
time
in
which
the
girl
could
have
been
killed
she
might
have
brought
the
girl
in
with
her
through
the
conservatory
windows
but
in
that
case
we
have
to
posit
some
sort
of
conspiracy
between
her
and
lady
fontclair
who
says
she
came
in
alone
she
might
have
let
the
girl
in
through
the
front
door
at
about
that
time
they
might
all
have
missed
one
another
but
it
seems
farfetched
and
there
she
said
to
me
babies
stay
just
the
same
i
thought
a
lot
about
the
two
of
them
both
past
sixty
and
finally
getting
to
have
a
baby
of
their
own
i
was
glad
for
them
i
could
see
it
was
no
burden
but
still
i
wished
it
was
nt
my
baby
they
had
at
the
end
of
the
day
rose
and
i
went
over
to
june
s
and
took
sissy
back
june
acted
like
we
were
tearing
her
heart
out
of
her
chest
she
ll
be
back
in
the
morning
june
said
first
thing
rose
said
june
watched
us
walk
back
toward
our
house
beside
the
hotel
this
is
nt
right
i
said
to
rose
sissy
fussing
a
little
in
my
arms
leaving
i
feel
sure
cecilia
got
more
attention
today
than
most
children
get
in
a
lifetime
i
just
do
nt
like
it
i
said
she
stopped
in
the
snow
halfway
between
saint
elizabeth
s
and
our
house
we
looked
at
each
other
in
the
darkness
the
stars
behind
her
head
looked
like
a
decoration
for
rose
i
m
tired
she
said
quietly
and
i
did
nt
say
see
there
i
told
you
and
i
did
nt
say
that
s
what
you
get
i
said
come
on
then
let
s
get
you
home
the
next
morning
when
i
was
on
the
second
floor
finishing
up
work
on
a
sink
flat
on
my
back
and
staring
up
at
the
curved
underside
of
a
washbowl
mother
corinne
came
in
son
she
said
i
wo
nt
have
this
i
sighed
sat
up
and
wiped
my
hands
i
d
gotten
good
at
being
careful
not
to
hit
my
head
she
s
not
a
resident
anymore
she
should
nt
be
here
she
s
my
wife
now
mother
then
she
should
stay
at
home
as
your
wife
im
none
too
pleased
about
the
way
all
of
this
went
it
was
nt
the
time
to
talk
to
you
before
but
i
ll
have
you
know
this
is
a
great
disappointment
to
me
i
trusted
you
son
if
i
d
known
you
were
going
to
be
picking
out
girls
for
yourself
i
would
have
dismissed
you
years
ago
i
stood
up
because
mother
corinne
used
her
size
to
bully
people
since
we
both
know
that
s
not
so
i
think
it
best
we
just
do
nt
get
into
it
she
flushed
a
little
bit
the
point
of
this
conversation
is
your
wife
s
continuing
to
work
in
our
kitchen
which
is
unsatisfac
tory
the
thing
you
had
to
do
if
you
were
going
to
deal
with
mother
corinne
was
forget
about
her
being
a
nun
i
stuff
took
all
her
guff
for
years
because
she
was
supposed
to
be
a
woman
of
god
you
had
to
deal
with
her
as
straight
as
she
dealt
with
you
or
you
were
dead
in
the
water
the
way
i
hear
it
told
the
food
went
downhill
fast
with
rose
gone
sister
evangeline
ca
nt
do
it
anymore
she
has
nt
been
able
to
for
years
and
she
ca
nt
have
a
different
girl
coming
and
going
for
each
meal
she
needs
someone
to
look
after
her
and
she
wants
that
someone
to
be
rose
as
for
my
feelings
i
d
tend
to
agree
with
you
she
s
not
getting
paid
and
she
s
working
like
a
horse
which
do
nt
make
much
sense
to
me
i
d
say
we
should
all
be
thankful
for
what
s
set
before
us
mother
corinne
mulled
on
this
for
a
minute
she
was
not
one
to
set
her
teeth
so
far
into
something
that
she
could
nt
let
go
when
presented
with
the
truth
if
she
s
not
asked
to
be
here
but
if
she
wants
to
help
for
a
while
she
said
then
i
suppose
that
could
be
arranged
but
her
daughter
will
have
to
stay
at
home
this
is
no
place
for
children
surely
even
you
would
be
able
to
understand
that
i
understand
that
fine
i
said
sissy
is
staying
with
june
clatterbuck
then
this
conversation
is
concluded
she
said
except
for
this
when
you
want
to
get
rid
of
rose
you
go
tell
rose
not
me
i
turned
the
cold
water
faucet
water
came
out
fixed
it
i
said
mother
corinne
nodded
toward
the
sink
and
left
me
there
i
did
nt
scare
her
and
i
did
nt
try
to
we
d
been
around
each
other
for
so
long
and
we
both
admitted
at
least
to
ourselves
that
we
were
dependent
me
on
the
work
and
her
on
the
worker
but
from
anybody
and
if
you
tried
to
tell
her
what
to
do
chances
were
she
was
going
to
tell
you
to
go
to
hell
sissy
was
pure
joy
as
smart
and
loving
a
child
as
god
s
made
being
around
so
many
people
while
she
was
growing
up
made
her
friendly
children
are
like
pups
sister
evangeline
told
me
the
more
people
picking
them
up
and
playing
with
them
the
more
people
they
ll
grow
up
liking
in
their
life
by
the
time
she
was
three
she
d
started
coming
over
to
saint
elizabeth
s
for
lunch
and
when
she
was
four
she
was
pretty
much
around
all
the
time
it
happened
gradually
so
that
even
mother
corinne
was
used
to
her
she
still
went
over
to
june
s
every
day
but
it
was
almost
like
she
was
too
busy
to
spend
the
whole
day
with
one
person
all
the
girls
wanted
their
time
with
her
they
wanted
to
brush
her
hair
and
read
her
stories
they
wanted
to
get
to
be
mothers
in
their
own
right
at
the
hotel
she
was
the
center
of
the
world
and
it
made
her
sweet
where
another
child
might
have
turned
spoiled
with
all
the
excitement
that
came
from
spending
her
days
at
saint
elizabeth
s
sissy
must
have
found
the
evenings
dull
two
quiet
parents
and
a
little
house
her
mother
read
cookbooks
at
the
kitchen
table
or
did
a
chapter
one
lt
st
james
keep
bavia
what
the
deuce
is
she
doing
up
there
rafael
st
james
prince
of
bavia
demanded
bending
as
far
out
his
chamber
window
as
he
could
without
plunging
headfirst
into
the
empty
moat
a
light
and
drizzling
rain
was
falling
that
gloomy
evening
in
late
may
but
he
could
see
all
too
clearly
annie
trevarren
a
lithe
barefooted
figure
clad
in
a
pair
of
kidskin
breeches
and
a
flowing
shirt
that
might
have
been
pinched
from
his
own
wardrobe
was
embracing
the
face
of
a
gargoyle
on
the
crumbling
parapet
of
the
south
tower
rafael
felt
an
inward
wrench
at
the
sight
of
her
a
tug
born
of
something
other
than
fear
for
her
safety
beside
him
his
eighteen
year
old
sister
phaedra
fidgeted
and
wrung
her
hands
annie
wanted
a
clear
view
of
the
lake
she
said
as
if
that
were
reason
enough
to
risk
life
and
limb
you
must
nt
be
angry
rafael
runs
in
the
trevarren
family
you
know
he
cursed
miss
annie
trevarren
and
her
alleged
adventurous
nature
as
he
whirled
away
from
the
window
and
sprinted
across
the
room
toward
the
yawning
doors
which
stood
a
little
ajar
because
of
phaedra
s
abrupt
entrance
the
princess
scurried
along
behind
him
moving
as
rapidly
as
her
cumbersome
skirts
would
allow
and
prattling
the
whole
way
rafael
ran
down
the
hall
toward
the
enclosed
staircase
in
the
southern
most
corner
of
the
keep
annie
occasionally
does
impulsive
things
but
she
invariably
regrets
them
later
and
makes
up
for
her
errors
quite
nicely
and
she
is
extremely
practical
in
most
instances
rafael
ignored
his
sister
s
breathless
blatherings
in
defense
of
her
friend
and
schoolmate
and
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
directing
his
thoughts
to
annie
hold
on
you
little
fool
just
hold
on
his
bodyguard
and
childhood
friend
edmund
barrett
reached
the
stairs
at
the
same
moment
as
rafael
it
was
plain
from
the
consternation
in
the
other
man
s
normally
trevarren
s
predicament
or
had
seen
it
for
himself
let
me
handle
this
your
highness
he
began
barrett
tended
to
address
rafael
formally
in
any
emergency
rafael
shook
his
head
and
pushed
past
barrett
to
mount
the
spiral
steps
he
was
still
the
master
of
st
james
keep
however
tenuous
his
hold
on
the
rest
of
the
country
might
be
and
thus
responsible
for
the
safety
of
those
within
its
ancient
walls
not
to
mention
the
young
woman
s
parents
patrick
and
charlotte
trevarren
were
among
his
most
valued
friends
what
would
he
say
to
them
if
annie
fell
to
her
death
that
they
still
had
four
daughters
left
and
should
nt
trouble
themselves
over
the
loss
of
the
eldest
the
little
minx
was
a
guest
in
his
house
had
been
for
a
week
and
it
was
his
responsibility
to
look
after
her
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
was
open
of
course
and
rafael
stepped
cautiously
over
the
threshold
annie
stood
several
yards
away
embracing
the
gargoyle
with
both
arms
her
red
gold
hair
tumbled
down
her
back
and
curled
in
the
moist
air
do
nt
worry
annie
phaedra
called
from
just
behind
the
prince
s
right
shoulder
rafael
will
save
you
be
quiet
and
stay
back
rafael
hissed
assessing
the
state
of
the
parapet
itself
the
rain
smelling
of
settled
dust
cooled
his
skin
to
annie
he
said
do
nt
move
apparently
st
aspasia
s
academy
for
young
women
of
quality
where
both
annie
and
phaedra
had
spent
the
past
few
years
learning
manners
and
deportment
had
served
at
least
some
part
of
its
purpose
even
in
that
dire
situation
and
it
was
dire
for
the
girl
was
standing
on
loose
pebbles
and
very
little
else
she
smiled
bravely
and
nodded
though
she
was
pale
and
trembling
i
wo
nt
she
promised
in
a
stoic
tone
rafael
indulged
a
perverse
desire
to
look
down
the
brick
dusk
and
a
number
of
spectators
had
congregated
their
torches
making
spots
of
fire
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
offered
a
silent
prayer
to
a
god
who
had
long
since
abandoned
him
then
eased
out
onto
the
ledge
some
of
the
stone
fell
away
beneath
his
feet
and
he
leaned
back
against
the
moss
slickened
wall
arms
spread
wide
breathing
deeply
should
the
trevarren
chit
be
fortunate
enough
to
survive
this
folly
he
reflected
he
might
well
murder
her
himself
do
be
careful
annie
counseled
as
though
he
were
the
one
who
needed
rescuing
rafael
felt
color
surge
up
his
neck
and
pulse
along
his
jawline
as
he
moved
closer
to
her
ever
so
slowly
progressing
by
inches
and
fractions
of
inches
i
was
nt
planning
to
hang
by
my
feet
or
do
handstands
miss
trevarren
he
replied
reasonably
this
was
no
time
or
place
after
all
to
lose
his
temper
if
they
were
both
lucky
he
would
have
he
vowed
to
himself
he
d
deliver
a
lecture
this
little
hellion
would
never
forget
after
that
he
might
just
throw
her
into
the
dungeon
or
hang
her
up
by
her
thumbs
he
reached
annie
s
side
on
the
strength
of
these
fantasies
and
slipped
one
arm
around
her
waist
all
right
miss
trevarren
he
said
quietly
with
a
calmness
he
did
nt
feel
release
your
hold
on
the
masonry
if
you
will
and
we
ll
start
back
it
s
going
to
be
a
slow
process
though
no
sudden
moves
or
we
ll
both
be
splattered
on
the
stones
of
the
courtyard
understood
remarkably
he
felt
her
bristle
ever
so
slightly
against
his
rib
cage
believe
me
your
highness
she
said
with
stiff
dignity
your
instructions
were
quite
clear
rafael
risked
a
step
holding
his
breath
rejoicing
inwardly
when
the
parapet
held
he
muttered
something
meaningless
even
to
himself
and
they
progressed
another
wall
then
tumbled
soundlessly
through
space
the
mist
had
turned
to
hard
rain
soaking
annie
s
clothes
and
hair
extinguishing
the
torches
below
and
making
the
stones
of
the
narrow
walkway
slippery
as
well
a
half
james
had
been
gone
finn
had
written
another
three
pages
of
his
essay
and
had
composed
the
covering
letter
no
doubt
james
would
be
upset
that
he
intended
to
run
an
errand
particularly
this
errand
before
going
home
damn
had
he
not
taken
so
much
wine
last
night
he
would
ve
been
able
to
get
up
earlier
to
finish
picking
up
the
house
earlier
and
to
make
his
stop
before
coming
to
the
airport
but
if
there
had
to
be
a
showdown
then
there
would
be
a
showdown
this
was
his
only
life
and
there
was
only
so
much
of
it
left
he
could
nt
concentrate
on
timon
of
athens
at
last
passengers
with
suitcases
and
garment
bags
began
straggling
down
the
long
passage
from
the
gates
to
the
security
station
no
one
had
even
bothered
to
announce
the
arrival
the
slipshod
way
everything
was
run
these
days
would
make
a
saint
querulous
yet
he
must
nt
visit
this
querulousness
on
james
who
would
need
his
support
now
his
canvas
duffel
bag
slung
from
his
shoulder
and
in
his
other
hand
what
a
net
bag
of
oranges
finn
gave
him
a
brotherly
one
armed
hug
james
bent
to
lay
the
oranges
on
the
floor
straightened
up
gripped
the
back
of
finn
s
neck
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
this
is
new
york
city
said
james
remember
forgive
an
old
man
said
finn
giving
his
still
one
armed
hug
another
pump
when
ye
git
my
age
sonny
if
said
james
finn
let
go
james
s
tan
he
noticed
was
even
deeper
than
when
he
d
left
so
something
more
had
been
going
on
apparently
than
just
the
compulsive
tv
watching
and
the
silent
family
dinners
he
d
re
created
so
amusingly
on
the
phone
ah
nature
s
bounty
said
finn
bending
to
pick
up
the
oranges
my
mother
insisted
said
james
both
of
us
well
well
well
said
finn
god
and
sinners
reconciled
but
would
nt
pink
grapefruit
have
been
more
appropriate
james
began
walking
the
sight
of
his
firm
buttocks
under
his
white
shorts
made
finn
suddenly
furious
your
tan
looks
splendid
he
said
catching
up
so
how
are
the
beach
girls
down
there
really
stacked
i
ll
bet
james
stopped
people
went
by
on
both
sides
paying
no
attention
hey
finn
said
james
why
do
nt
you
give
it
a
rest
o
k
i
m
just
really
not
up
to
it
it
s
been
a
bad
week
yes
i
can
see
it
must
have
been
hell
said
finn
appalled
that
he
could
nt
shut
up
i
do
nt
believe
this
is
happening
said
james
i
ve
been
off
the
plane
for
two
minutes
and
already
we
re
in
sorry
jamie
said
finn
i
do
nt
know
what
the
hell
s
wrong
with
me
can
we
not
stand
here
in
the
middle
of
all
this
sorry
here
he
touched
james
s
shoulder
to
guide
him
we
re
parked
down
this
way
they
walked
a
few
steps
towards
the
escalator
and
james
stopped
again
look
he
said
would
you
rather
i
just
took
a
cab
into
the
city
and
got
out
of
your
life
jamie
i
m
truly
because
i
do
nt
seem
to
be
making
you
very
happy
and
you
re
driving
me
out
of
my
mind
you
re
shouting
said
finn
what
these
people
have
never
seen
a
pair
of
bickering
faggots
before
well
he
was
shouting
now
at
any
rate
james
said
finn
for
christ
s
sake
said
james
well
my
parents
have
a
pool
man
in
their
backyard
which
is
where
i
sat
for
nine
days
man
watching
game
shows
with
my
mother
she
keeps
a
tv
out
there
so
she
can
work
on
her
tan
she
looks
like
distressed
leather
my
father
meanwhile
sits
in
the
den
with
the
blinds
closed
watching
i
kid
you
not
old
super
bowl
games
on
his
vcr
he
s
got
tapes
of
all
but
four
of
however
fucking
many
super
bowls
there
are
and
he
s
scared
shitless
and
he
eats
so
much
valium
his
flesh
is
turning
to
balsa
wood
i
m
so
sorry
said
finn
look
said
james
do
you
mind
very
much
if
we
get
out
of
here
in
the
parking
garage
finn
unlocked
the
passenger
door
first
james
in
turn
reached
over
and
unlocked
the
driver
s
door
which
finn
took
as
a
sign
of
conciliation
he
decided
not
to
and
stroked
the
back
of
james
s
head
james
allowed
it
when
they
came
out
into
the
sunlight
it
was
still
only
five
o
clock
finn
put
on
the
air
conditioning
james
had
taught
him
that
it
was
more
fun
to
keep
the
windows
open
when
the
air
was
on
even
though
it
was
nt
fuel
efficient
on
the
grand
central
traffic
in
the
other
direction
was
motionless
but
inbound
it
was
moving
right
along
i
hate
to
backseat
drive
said
james
but
should
nt
we
be
in
the
other
lane
ordinarily
said
finn
but
i
need
to
make
a
quick
stop
off
in
midtown
for
what
finn
drew
a
long
breath
let
it
out
for
something
you
do
nt
approve
of
he
said
oh
said
james
he
looked
at
his
watch
you
know
it
s
going
to
take
hours
to
get
in
and
out
of
manhattan
at
this
time
your
way
i
m
sorry
said
finn
i
ll
make
this
as
quick
as
i
possibly
can
but
i
get
to
the
city
so
seldom
that
i
really
must
nt
pass
up
the
chance
so
this
is
why
you
were
so
anxious
to
come
down
and
pick
me
up
said
james
tell
me
something
do
you
ever
think
your
tastes
might
be
a
little
depraved
we
ve
been
over
this
said
finn
well
let
me
put
it
in
another
light
for
you
said
james
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
it
might
be
insulting
to
me
they
were
caught
behind
a
huge
yellow
school
bus
the
lanes
on
either
side
were
nt
another
black
pasty
morning
shrouded
the
camp
and
nacho
like
always
was
up
early
getting
ready
for
his
job
as
a
porter
in
the
library
i
saw
him
with
a
can
of
magic
shaving
powder
he
shaved
about
every
fourth
day
but
the
job
was
a
daily
thing
and
at
least
twice
a
week
the
librarian
threatened
to
write
him
up
over
his
beard
stubble
usually
with
a
guard
present
finally
he
would
shave
i
never
liked
that
aspect
of
working
either
just
tighter
confinement
around
the
rules
of
prison
like
a
hat
size
that
was
constantly
being
reduced
but
i
knew
nacho
he
had
lived
across
from
me
in
the
dorm
for
close
to
a
year
one
of
the
first
things
i
had
noticed
were
the
two
teardrops
he
had
green
teardrops
tattooed
below
the
corner
of
his
left
eye
each
drop
represented
five
years
in
stir
he
also
had
a
large
cobra
coiled
in
the
small
of
his
back
of
his
neck
his
arms
were
designed
with
affiliation
symbols
club
symbols
and
during
the
lockdowns
when
separated
from
his
homeboys
we
sometimes
kicked
it
together
but
since
i
was
nt
working
i
had
nacho
get
me
up
that
morning
for
breakfast
he
d
said
that
the
school
across
from
the
library
might
be
looking
for
another
porter
the
plan
was
to
check
it
out
with
him
after
chow
the
rest
of
the
dorm
just
snored
contentedly
like
apes
stretched
out
in
a
tropical
lull
i
lay
in
bed
scratching
not
at
all
eager
to
work
or
to
hustle
up
one
of
their
jobs
i
knew
that
porters
were
a
special
type
of
janitor
who
hung
out
a
lot
on
the
job
after
they
cleaned
and
mopped
and
did
the
rest
of
their
schedule
they
were
often
contacts
between
yards
running
a
sort
of
messenger
service
for
small
favors
no
room
for
scrubs
in
this
line
of
work
but
most
of
them
had
been
fucked
over
at
one
fresh
from
the
academy
who
confused
prison
with
the
duties
of
a
high
school
hall
monitor
yet
nacho
had
tried
to
school
me
the
previous
night
he
explained
it
this
way
capone
atwood
all
them
old
gangsters
used
to
be
porters
now
you
have
crips
and
el
rukins
bloods
who
are
porters
yeah
i
had
told
him
shit
he
said
it
s
an
honorable
tradition
a
tough
tradition
he
then
leaned
a
little
closer
i
heard
that
james
brown
worked
as
a
porter
the
godfather
ese
a
real
classy
bro
in
the
union
i
had
told
him
all
right
i
might
become
a
porter
but
as
usual
i
was
thinking
about
my
own
ass
we
were
in
a
high
medium
institution
and
you
got
fucked
around
badly
if
you
did
nt
hire
on
somewhere
they
started
by
having
you
rake
rocks
on
the
track
by
the
dorms
which
enclosed
took
an
amount
of
good
time
and
put
you
on
the
shotgun
crew
when
you
told
them
to
jam
that
crew
you
were
taken
off
the
yard
placed
in
a
higher
super
maximum
run
and
given
a
cell
with
some
headcase
i
knew
there
were
plenty
of
nuts
around
our
camp
and
felt
no
need
to
be
on
a
permanent
lockdown
basis
with
one
so
i
figured
the
sensible
thing
would
be
to
cover
myself
to
just
fart
along
with
the
game
until
i
made
a
lower
security
yard
and
since
jobs
meant
bosses
and
authority
i
also
thought
it
would
be
sensible
to
work
as
little
as
possible
it
was
barely
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
nacho
came
back
wearing
blue
striped
boxers
scuffling
the
floor
with
his
shower
shoes
he
dumped
the
shaving
material
on
his
bed
and
sat
down
opened
his
locker
i
saw
the
roll
on
his
stomach
and
the
old
knife
wound
which
glowed
like
cartilage
upon
his
left
side
someone
had
once
caught
him
from
behind
or
the
other
about
who
had
the
claim
to
a
job
opening
i
exhaled
sawdust
from
the
last
of
my
cigarette
thinking
of
breakfast
peeling
slowly
at
first
from
my
sheets
to
get
dressed
our
shirts
were
blue
the
air
was
black
my
rug
was
a
towel
i
had
folded
under
the
bunk
and
the
dorm
was
freezing
when
you
had
hot
arizona
skin
i
got
into
my
clothes
as
quickly
as
possible
the
light
from
the
bathroom
like
a
white
frosting
on
my
eyes
i
glanced
at
grissom
my
cellmate
as
i
tied
on
my
boots
he
was
all
right
he
just
snored
under
the
hairy
black
blanket
nacho
still
sat
on
his
bed
in
his
boxers
unfolding
t
shirts
his
television
on
i
tucked
in
my
shirt
and
called
him
a
cold
calloused
motherfucker
he
put
his
teeth
together
and
hissed
at
the
wall
five
minutes
he
said
adjusting
the
volume
on
his
set
always
this
nervous
bit
of
him
but
i
need
some
air
i
wan
na
breathe
air
again
su
aliento
huele
a
mielda
he
said
your
breath
smells
like
shit
no
doubt
i
put
my
jacket
on
and
went
outside
spitting
at
the
trash
can
that
stood
near
our
walk
i
glanced
at
the
sky
the
world
up
there
was
like
an
asphalt
parachute
rugged
wet
charcoal
the
yard
and
the
trailers
looked
worse
like
filmed
reports
i
d
seen
of
outback
nicaragua
the
smarter
convicts
wore
stocking
caps
going
into
and
coming
out
of
the
chowhall
i
drifted
looking
for
my
breath
against
the
clouds
and
porters
went
through
this
shit
every
morning
nacho
came
out
jacketless
wearing
his
shades
fuck
he
said
cold
out
here
but
all
he
did
was
shrug
we
footed
it
the
short
distance
to
the
chowhall
there
was
a
short
line
when
we
arrived
we
walked
up
the
cattle
at
the
corner
to
the
right
it
was
spacious
almost
elevated
in
there
though
a
hundred
steel
tables
were
cemented
in
the
floor
each
table
was
fitted
with
four
attached
stools
and
glowed
under
these
snarling
length
long
fixtures
my
mother
stumbles
going
through
the
door
and
mr
arnette
catches
her
leads
her
inside
then
he
comes
back
out
grunts
and
sits
down
on
the
porch
step
what
have
looking
through
this
i
say
holding
up
the
album
he
is
quiet
for
a
moment
then
he
says
you
ever
see
your
father
he
says
it
almost
as
an
afterthought
but
to
something
that
was
nt
said
he
says
it
like
we
ve
been
on
the
porch
together
all
night
discussing
my
father
for
hours
like
he
was
really
one
of
the
family
just
in
here
i
say
think
he
s
still
a
good
looking
guy
dashing
i
imagine
i
say
he
snorts
out
a
laugh
why
d
you
marry
her
i
hear
myself
ask
he
leans
back
rests
his
head
on
the
wood
inches
from
my
feet
company
he
says
he
yawns
and
i
can
see
him
now
too
safety
glass
that
still
shatters
he
begins
to
snore
mr
arnette
i
say
i
reach
down
he
does
nt
move
i
go
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
their
bedroom
door
is
closed
and
i
imagine
my
mother
is
in
about
the
same
shape
as
he
is
but
that
they
will
sleep
it
off
in
different
places
with
dreams
of
different
people
s
arms
when
i
open
my
door
my
mother
is
standing
in
my
room
the
empty
bottle
of
xanax
in
one
hand
the
other
hand
palm
up
as
if
she
were
questioning
someone
even
before
i
arrived
wait
a
minute
i
say
just
wait
i
knew
it
she
says

was
something
wrong

my
room

the
cigarette
between
my
fingers
and
reach
for
another
one
she
sits
down
on
the
bed

hurt
people
she
says

pills
because

nt
want
you
to
hurt
me
i

bed
and
stands
up

my
mother
standing
on
the
front
porch
as
i
get
out
of
my
first
police
car
only
fourteen
braces
squeezing
my
teeth
she
stares
at

in
disbelief
when

police

her
that

caused
over
a
thousand
dollars
in
damage
at
the
record

mr

on
the
top
of
the
head
presses
her
lips
into
his
hair
for
a
long
time
until
he
moves
away
what

that

i
can
tell
it
does
nt
have
to
be
for
anything

she
says
she
smiles
at

for
a
moment
as

mother

through

his
eyebrows
i
d
like
to
see
them
i
say
i
hear
my
mother
s
car
start
up
in
the
driveway
lust
one
time
see
them
together
be
a
fly
on
the
wall
we
can
be
flies
together
he
says
it
is
not
a
long
drive
only
a
few
miles
much
too
close
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
for
something
that
seems
like
it
must
be
another
world
mr
arnette
stays
a
few
cars
behind
her
then
drives
past
the
motel
after
she
pulls
into
the
lot
he
drives
around
the
block
twice
the
three
times
what
are
you
waiting
for
i
ask
him
a
reason
not
to
do
used
to
grab
us
by
the
hair
on
the
back
of
our
necks
tilting
our
heads
so
we
looked
into
his
face
i
want
you
to
look
at
me
when
i
talk
to
you
that
was
about
the
worst
of
it
until
del
started
getting
into
trouble
and
by
that
time
my
father
s
blows
were
nt
enough
del
would
laugh
he
would
strike
back
it
was
then
that
my
father
finally
decided
to
turn
him
over
to
the
authorities
he
had
no
other
choice
he
said
he
must
have
believed
it
he
was
nt
despite
his
temper
a
bad
man
a
bad
parent
he
d
seemed
so
kindly
sometimes
so
fatherly
especially
with
del
i
remember
watching
them
from
my
window
some
autumn
mornings
watching
them
wade
through
the
high
weeds
in
the
stubble
field
out
behind
our
house
walking
toward
the
hill
with
their
shotguns
pointing
at
the
ground
their
steps
slow
synchronized
once
i
d
gone
upstairs
and
heard
them
laughing
in
del
s
and
my
bedroom
i
just
stood
there
outside
the
doorway
watching
as
my
father
job
their
talk
easy
happy
this
was
what
i
thought
of
that
night
we
were
talking
i
thought
of
my
own
son
the
innocent
baby
i
loved
so
much
and
it
chilled
me
to
think
that
things
could
change
so
much
that
del
s
closeness
to
my
father
could
turn
in
on
itself
transformed
into
the
kind
of
closeness
that
thrived
on
their
fights
on
the
different
ways
del
could
push
my
father
into
a
rage
that
finally
my
father
would
feel
he
had
no
choices
left
we
looked
at
each
other
my
father
and
i
what
are
you
thinking
i
said
softly
but
he
just
shook
his
head
del
and
i
had
never
been
close
we
had
never
been
like
friends
or
even
like
brothers
yet
after
that
day
on
the
elevator
i
came
to
realize
that
there
had
been
something
between
us
there
had
been
something
that
could
be
taken
away
he
stopped
talking
to
me
altogether
for
a
while
in
the
if
we
even
looked
at
each
other
more
than
two
or
three
times
though
we
shared
the
same
room
for
a
while
i
slept
on
the
couch
i
was
afraid
to
go
up
to
our
bedroom
i
can
remember
those
first
few
nights
waiting
in
the
living
room
for
my
father
to
go
to
bed
the
television
hissing
with
laughter
the
furniture
the
table
the
floors
seemed
to
shudder
as
i
touched
them
as
if
they
were
just
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
burst
apart
i
d
go
outside
sometimes
though
that
was
really
no
better
it
was
the
period
of
late
summer
when
thunderstorms
seemed
to
pass
over
every
night
the
wind
came
up
the
shivering
tops
of
trees
bent
in
the
flashes
of
heat
lightning
there
was
no
way
out
of
the
situation
i
d
created
i
could
see
that
days
and
weeks
stretched
out
in
front
of
me
more
than
a
month
before
school
started
by
that
time
i
thought
maybe
it
the
whole
series
of
bad
things
that
had
happened
another
layer
of
paint
that
would
eventually
be
covered
over
by
a
new
one
forgotten
if
he
really
had
pushed
me
that
was
what
would
have
happened
it
would
have
been
like
the
time
he
tried
to
choke
me
or
the
time
he
tried
to
drive
the
car
off
the
hill
once
those
incidents
were
over
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
this
was
the
last
time
there
was
always
the
hope
that
everything
would
be
beer
now
in
retrospect
it
would
nt
have
been
so
hard
to
recant
there
would
have
been
a
big
scene
of
course
i
would
have
been
punished
humiliated
i
would
have
had
to
endure
my
brother
s
triumph
my
parent
s
disgust
but
i
realize
now
that
i
would
nt
have
been
so
bad
i
might
have
finally
told
the
truth
too
if
del
had
reacted
the
way
i
expected
i
imagined
that
there
would
be
a
string
of
confrontations
in
protest
with
my
father
i
figured
he
would
nt
give
up
but
he
did
after
that
night
he
did
nt
try
to
deny
it
anymore
for
a
while
i
even
thought
that
maybe
he
had
begun
to
believe
that
he
pushed
me
he
acted
like
a
guilty
person
eating
his
supper
in
silence
walking
noiselessly
through
the
living
room
his
shoulders
hunched
like
a
traveler
on
a
snowy
road
my
parents
seemed
to
take
this
as
penitence
they
still
spoke
sternly
but
their
tone
began
to
be
edged
by
gentleness
a
kind
of
forgiveness
did
you
take
out
the
trash
they
would
ask
another
potato
and
they
would
wait
for
him
to
quickly
nod
he
was
truly
sorry
they
thought
everything
was
finally
going
to
be
o
k
he
was
shaping
up
at
these
times
i
noticed
something
in
his
eyes
a
kind
of
sharpness
a
subtle
shift
of
the
iris
he
would
lower
his
head
to
me
his
face
seemed
to
flicker
with
hidden
mysterious
thoughts
when
i
finally
began
to
sleep
in
our
room
again
he
pretended
i
was
nt
there
i
would
come
in
almost
as
quiet
as
he
himself
had
become
to
find
him
sitting
at
our
desk
or
on
his
bed
peeling
off
a
sock
with
such
slow
concentration
that
it
might
have
been
his
skin
it
was
as
if
there
were
an
unspoken
agreement
between
us
i
no
longer
existed
he
would
nt
look
at
me
but
i
could
watch
him
for
as
long
as
i
wanted
i
would
pull
the
covers
over
myself
and
just
lie
there
observing
as
he
went
about
doing
whatever
he
was
doing
as
if
oblivious
he
listened
to
a
tape
on
his
headphones
flipped
through
a
magazine
did
sit
ups
sat
staring
out
the
window
turned
out
the
light
and
all
that
time
his
face
remained
neutral
impassive
once
he
even
chuckled
to
himself
at
a
book
he
was
reading
when
crazy
angles
to
one
another
to
accommodate
the
dividing
curtains
he
set
up
his
wife
with
a
sitz
bath
in
the
narrow
bathroom
through
the
curtains
he
could
hear
a
nurse
scolding
one
of
the
new
mothers
you
have
to
change
him
she
said
it
s
your
responsibility
the
walls
of
the
bathroom
were
green
and
when
the
door
opened
and
his
wife
came
out
from
her
sitz
bath
and
maneuvered
herself
into
bed
her
section
of
the
room
was
washed
with
a
greenish
light
he
tucked
her
in
and
asked
if
she
wanted
her
teddy
bear
she
shook
her
head
no
he
was
not
allowed
to
stay
in
any
of
the
parents
rooms
because
they
had
all
been
previously
booked
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
stay
in
his
wife
s
room
he
found
a
small
waiting
room
across
from
blanket
from
his
wife
s
bag
the
room
was
airless
and
dark
and
cold
and
he
did
not
think
he
could
sleep
he
woke
to
the
feeling
of
someone
recovering
him
with
the
blanket
is
that
you
he
said
what
time
is
it
a
quarter
to
four
he
made
himself
get
up
into
the
cold
room
he
walked
out
into
the
hallway
with
her
there
were
still
skins
of
little
puddles
where
he
d
dropped
the
ice
as
they
hurried
along
the
corridor
to
the
icn
he
asked
her
if
she
d
heard
anything
nothing
she
said
their
baby
s
side
of
the
nursery
was
well
lit
in
an
enclosed
room
off
to
the
right
a
woman
in
blue
scrubs
bent
over
a
spiral
notebook
with
a
four
color
pen
she
looked
up
nodded
at
the
parents
and
scrawled
on
a
ruled
line
they
washed
their
hands
for
one
minute
and
pulled
on
the
sterile
yellow
gowns
he
put
his
baby
they
stood
by
the
side
of
the
bed
her
belly
was
puffed
up
and
her
chest
fluttered
in
regular
wingbeats
as
the
respirator
fed
her
air
a
dark
ring
of
crusted
blood
had
formed
around
the
white
tube
at
her
umbilicus
her
cheeks
pursed
against
the
white
adhesive
tape
and
dried
perspiration
left
a
film
around
her
eyes
and
on
her
forehead
at
two
of
the
iv
insertions
one
at
the
foot
and
one
on
the
hand
little
bulbs
of
orange
light
had
been
attached
in
an
almost
ornamental
fashion
you
can
touch
her
someone
said
behind
them
and
talk
to
her
too
she
ll
recognize
your
voices
it
was
the
doctor
leaning
against
his
sink
the
mother
reached
out
and
stroked
an
unmarred
length
of
the
baby
s
arm
when
she
was
finished
the
father
felt
along
the
soft
skin
patches
flaking
with
a
layer
of
birth
fluid
you
re
the
only
ones
who
touch
her
who
wo
nt
hurt
her
us
touches
her
he
smiled
apologetically
it
s
to
start
an
iv
or
suction
the
breathing
tube
the
mother
bent
down
to
the
baby
hi
sweetie
she
said
how
is
she
doing
the
father
said
the
pictures
were
not
good
the
doctor
looked
at
both
of
them
as
the
mother
turned
from
the
baby
but
she
s
shown
great
resiliency
her
heart
is
normal
she
s
urinating
which
means
her
kidneys
are
in
order
he
pointed
at
the
respirator
settings
you
can
see
for
yourself
she
needs
a
hundred
percent
oxygen
eighty
breaths
a
minute
she
s
not
processing
it
that
well
we
ll
have
to
wait
and
see
she
s
not
stable
the
mother
said
she
s
critical
the
doctor
said
how
many
cases
of
this
do
you
see
a
year
the
father
said
the
doctor
shrugged
happens
next
the
mother
said
we
ll
have
to
see
the
father
touched
his
daughter
s
arm
gently
scraped
away
some
of
the
flaking
an
alarm
gonged
the
father
was
horrified
the
woman
in
blue
scrubs
came
out
from
her
office
and
shut
the
sound
off
looked
around
at
the
father
and
the
mother
and
the
doctor
i
do
nt
think
you
should
touch
the
baby
she
said
they
can
touch
the
baby
the
doctor
said
she
pulled
up
a
high
cushioned
chair
on
wheels
and
sat
next
to
the
bed
with
her
notebook
where
were
we
the
doctor
said
the
father
was
torn
between
wanting
to
be
with
the
baby
as
closely
as
he
could
to
let
her
know
he
was
there
and
wanting
to
listen
to
the
doctor
the
mother
lay
a
pinky
in
the
baby
s
hand
and
the
baby
squeezed
it
her
face
grimacing
around
the
white
tape
another
alarm
beeped
and
clicked
it
off
do
you
have
any
family
here
the
doctor
said
to
the
parents
no
the
mother
said
they
re
all
on
the
east
coast
they
ll
be
coming
out
the
father
added
quickly
good
the
doctor
said
he
started
to
leave
then
tapped
the
white
index
card
on
the
side
of
the
warming
bed
that
said
baby
girl
keenan
let
us
know
when
you
name
her
he
said
when
he
was
gone
the
woman
in
scrubs
looked
up
from
her
book
i
did
nt
mean
to
be
rude
she
said
it
s
just
better
for
the
baby
if
she
rests
as
quietly
as
possible
she
got
up
and
retreated
to
the
little
office
behind
the
glass
windows
they
stood
by
the
baby
in
the
mother
s
bag
in
her
room
was
a
list
of
a
half
dozen
boys
and
girls
names
but
they
had
for
the
boy
emery
for
the
girl
after
the
mother
s
grandfather
the
girl
lay
there
in
sleep
with
her
knees
at
a
slightly
jaunty
angle
as
if
perhaps
she
could
push
herself
up
and
run
off
the
father
did
nt
want
to
name
her
just
yet
to
name
her
would
be
to
somehow
condemn
her
he
felt
superstitious
just
as
he
d
been
about
calling
the
grandparents
he
felt
it
was
better
to
wait
until
everything
was
in
the
state
it
ought
to
be
he
could
feel
the
pressure
of
his
wife
beside
him
wanting
of
his
father
s
debts
within
two
years
daniel
said
there
was
cool
admiration
in
his
voice
he
rebuilt
his
father
s
fortune
from
scratch
it
s
now
far
larger
than
it
was
before
edward
rain
disappeared
which
should
tell
you
something
about
oliver
poor
oliver
annie
whispered
he
must
have
been
emotionally
devastated
when
his
father
vanished
daniel
frowned
in
alarm
now
annie
the
shame
and
humiliation
would
have
been
intolerable
to
a
man
like
that
annie
continued
thoughtfully
he
s
obviously
been
scarred
for
life
no
wonder
he
s
not
very
outgoing
hold
it
right
there
daniel
ordered
don
t
even
think
about
it
about
what
annie
asked
innocently
about
trying
to
rescue
oliver
rain
he
is
definitely
not
another
wounded
stray
male
you
can
add
to
your
everyone
needs
to
be
rescued
at
one
time
or
another
daniel
not
rain
daniel
said
flatly
that
man
can
take
care
of
himself
trust
me
annie
did
not
see
or
hear
from
rain
again
until
two
weeks
later
he
had
called
the
day
after
daniel
s
private
plane
went
down
in
the
ocean
on
a
flight
to
alaska
that
had
been
a
month
ago
in
october
rain
had
asked
her
very
gently
if
she
needed
help
of
any
kind
caught
up
in
the
chaos
of
the
situation
struggling
to
deal
with
reporters
and
the
authorities
who
were
conducting
the
search
and
rescue
operation
as
well
as
trying
to
console
joanna
annie
had
been
tense
and
distracted
she
had
brusquely
told
oliver
rain
that
she
did
not
need
his
assistance
it
was
only
as
she
hung
up
the
phone
that
she
belatedly
recalled
the
fact
that
rain
was
her
brother
s
chief
creditor
now
that
daniel
had
disappeared
rain
was
a
potential
threat
if
he
chose
to
call
fledgling
company
lacked
leadership
lyncroft
unlimited
would
go
under
there
was
simply
no
way
to
pay
off
oliver
rain
at
this
point
but
it
was
nt
rain
who
had
turned
out
to
be
the
immediate
threat
it
was
a
coalition
of
suppliers
and
the
other
investors
all
of
whom
panicked
when
they
realized
that
daniel
was
no
longer
at
the
helm
of
his
company
barry
cork
daniel
s
trusted
assistant
did
the
best
he
could
to
reassure
everyone
that
business
was
going
on
as
usual
but
no
one
believed
him
a
few
days
later
rain
had
called
again
perhaps
we
had
better
talk
he
said
quietly
about
what
annie
demanded
knowing
full
well
what
he
wanted
to
discuss
lyncroft
s
future
lyncroft
is
doing
just
fine
thank
you
barry
cork
has
everything
under
control
my
brother
will
be
rescued
any
day
now
and
everything
will
go
back
to
normal
i
m
sorry
ms
lyncroft
but
you
must
face
i
do
nt
believe
that
and
neither
does
his
fiance
we
re
going
to
hold
lyncroft
together
until
he
returns
annie
gripped
the
phone
cord
and
tried
to
keep
her
voice
calm
and
confident
i
appreciate
your
concern
but
nothing
has
changed
at
the
company
everything
s
under
control
i
see
there
was
a
long
silence
on
the
line
i
hear
rumors
that
some
of
your
brother
s
other
creditors
are
starting
to
press
for
a
sale
or
merger
nonsense
strictly
rumors
i
ve
explained
to
all
ofthem
that
things
are
fine
and
that
we
expect
daniel
to
return
soon
there
was
another
thoughtful
silence
as
you
wish
please
feel
free
to
call
me
if
the
other
investors
become
difficult
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
annie
had
hung
up
the
phone
feeling
more
uneasy
than
ever
lyncroft
unlimited
was
a
family
owned
corporation
no
one
except
family
members
could
hold
stock
in
the
firm
daniel
had
been
intent
on
there
were
only
two
members
of
the
lyncroft
family
annie
and
her
brother
that
made
annie
daniel
s
sole
inheritor
two
weeks
ago
rain
had
again
contacted
her
instead
of
talking
about
the
fate
of
lyncroft
unlimited
he
had
explained
that
he
was
requesting
her
services
in
a
professional
capacity
he
wanted
her
to
provide
the
finishing
touches
for
the
rooms
in
his
new
penthouse
annie
was
still
not
quite
sure
why
she
had
accepted
the
job
she
certainly
had
more
than
enough
to
do
without
taking
time
out
of
her
frantic
days
to
provide
personal
consultation
to
a
client
but
today
was
her
fourth
visit
to
the
twenty
sixth
floor
of
the
downtown
seattle
high
rise
thus
far
it
had
followed
the
same
pattern
as
the
previous
visits
it
was
nt
easy
getting
to
oliver
rain
first
she
had
to
get
past
the
doorman
in
the
lobby
of
the
building
there
was
a
special
code
that
had
to
be
punched
into
the
elevator
control
panel
in
order
to
get
to
the
twenty
sixth
floor
when
she
arrived
robot
of
a
man
known
only
as
bolt
he
appeared
to
be
a
combination
of
butler
and
chauffeur
annie
wondered
if
he
was
also
a
bodyguard
in
his
own
way
bolt
was
almost
as
interesting
as
his
employer
he
looked
to
be
somewhere
in
his
early
fifties
every
time
annie
had
seen
him
he
had
been
wearing
a
formal
dark
suit
his
pale
blue
eyes
betrayed
no
emotion
of
any
kind
his
thinning
hair
was
razored
to
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
all
over
his
head
there
was
a
mechanical
quality
about
bolt
that
made
annie
wonder
if
he
was
part
machine
she
had
visions
of
him
plugging
himself
into
an
electrical
outlet
each
night
to
recharge
his
batteries
she
got
the
distinct
impression
he
did
not
approve
of
her
on
that
first
visit
bolt
had
shown
her
into
the
study
with
a
minimum
of
words
tea
had
been
brought
in
on
a
tray
annie
had
waited
nervously
for
rain
to
bring
up
the
subject
of
her
missing
brother
but
he
had
proceeded
to
after
the
first
consultation
annie
had
begun
to
look
forward
to
these
quiet
serene
interludes
during
the
time
she
was
safely
secluded
here
in
rain
s
study
drinking
his
exotic
aromatic
d
like
to
know
what
made
me
like
i
am
in
every
aspect
until
i
was
seven
years
old
i
was
the
happiest
child
on
the
planet
my
parents
and
sister
and
i
lived
next
door
to
two
houses
filled
with
cousins
and
aunts
and
uncles
and
a
couple
of
sets
of
grandparents
it
was
heaven
i
was
the
ringleader
of
the
bunch
ordering
everyone
about
telling
them
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
my
creativity
was
truly
appreciated
well
maybe
not
appreciated
by
everyone
there
was
the
time
i
saw
my
grandmother
twist
the
head
off
a
chicken
so
i
told
my
cousin
we
ought
to
help
nana
and
twist
the
heads
off
all
the
chickens
there
we
were
no
more
than
five
years
old
chickens
tucked
between
our
scraped
knees
and
twisting
and
twisting
and
twisting
my
grandmother
came
out
of
the
house
with
a
load
of
wash
and
there
were
all
her
chickens
their
heads
cocked
to
one
side
listing
drunkenly
about
the
yard
temper
of
my
grandmother
i
do
nt
know
how
my
cousin
and
i
escaped
alive
but
those
wonderful
years
ended
soon
enough
when
my
mother
decided
she
d
had
enough
of
her
mother
in
law
s
renowned
temper
my
mother
who
could
defeat
any
temper
with
her
rock
hard
stubbornness
on
one
fateful
day
informed
my
father
that
she
had
bought
a
piece
of
land
and
he
was
going
to
build
her
a
house
on
it
in
my
parents
household
we
all
liked
to
pretend
that
my
father
was
the
one
who
made
the
rules
i
think
the
rule
he
made
was
give
mama
what
she
wants
or
she
ll
make
life
hell
for
all
of
us
whatever
his
thoughts
he
was
nt
fool
enough
to
say
no
to
my
mother
when
she
had
that
look
in
her
eye
whatever
the
philosophy
behind
it
the
result
was
the
same
we
moved
in
that
one
day
i
lost
all
those
cousins
and
grandparents
i
lost
the
chickens
and
the
cows
and
the
possum
that
lived
in
a
barrel
in
chiggers
and
i
lost
apple
trees
to
climb
in
one
day
i
went
from
being
the
champion
of
all
a
person
of
prime
importance
to
being
the
toolong
in
a
matter
of
hours
i
went
from
having
the
most
exciting
life
in
the
world
to
having
a
life
of
supreme
dullness
my
mother
and
sister
were
cut
out
of
the
same
cloth
they
were
good
good
good
good
what
is
more
boring
than
good
my
mother
was
always
saying
do
nt
eat
too
much
chocolate
it
ll
make
you
sick
or
i
ca
nt
look
at
that
right
now
i
have
too
much
work
to
do
or
hayden
you
can
not
read
that
book
now
you
have
nt
finished
cleaning
the
bathroom
on
and
on
she
went
there
was
a
right
time
and
a
wrong
time
for
everything
but
as
far
as
i
could
tell
the
right
time
for
exuberance
never
came
did
nt
people
ever
want
to
do
something
that
was
nt
on
world
who
actually
wanted
to
eat
as
much
chocolate
as
i
could
hold
and
damn
the
consequences
looking
back
i
think
that
some
people
are
afraid
to
break
out
of
the
rules
maybe
they
re
afraid
that
if
they
break
the
rules
they
ll
lose
all
self
control
and
become
something
horrible
in
my
mother
s
case
that
would
be
a
woman
with
a
dirty
bathroom
floor
whatever
was
behind
it
all
again
the
result
was
the
same
i
was
put
in
a
bubble
of
isolation
and
left
there
alone
i
had
to
try
to
remember
to
sit
up
straight
walk
sedately
and
never
never
be
rambunctious
i
tried
but
it
s
difficult
to
control
yourself
when
you
re
a
child
i
guess
an
awful
lot
of
me
slipped
out
because
i
heard
the
phrase
you
know
how
you
are
a
few
million
times
sometimes
i
got
the
feeling
that
my
parents
thought
that
if
they
did
nt
keep
me
under
rigid
control
every
minute
of
every
day
that
i
d
lose
it
altogether
just
plain
never
stop
maybe
they
feared
not
being
able
to
reel
me
back
in
if
they
just
let
me
go
ahead
and
be
myself
now
that
i
m
an
adult
and
know
all
about
adult
things
uh
huh
sure
i
know
that
my
parents
were
not
creative
and
i
was
if
they
bought
something
that
needed
assembly
they
read
the
box
and
put
it
together
in
the
way
the
manufacturer
wanted
them
to
if
i
bought
something
i
felt
that
reading
the
instructions
was
cheating
and
if
i
could
nt
put
it
together
easily
it
was
quite
ordinary
for
me
to
jump
up
and
down
on
the
box
and
say
all
the
dirty
words
i
knew
which
thankfully
were
nt
many
my
punishment
for
box
jumping
or
any
infraction
of
the
peace
rules
was
to
be
talked
to
for
my
own
good
never
in
my
life
have
i
understood
that
phrase
when
someone
says
this
is
for
your
own
good
it
always
always
always
means
that
someone
is
power
so
anyway
how
did
i
survive
these
spirit
killers
how
did
i
survive
being
dragged
to
the
preacher
so
he
could
talk
to
me
because
i
was
different
how
did
i
survive
hearing
my
mother
ask
my
relatives
if
they
had
any
idea
what
she
could
do
with
me
i
did
the
best
i
could
by
escaping
into
a
land
of
stories
i
read
incessantly
when
my
mother
made
me
vacuum
the
bedroom
i
shared
with
my
sister
she
was
more
concerned
with
the
length
of
time
i
spent
vacuuming
than
with
how
clean
the
floor
was
after
i
was
finished
all
she
ever
checked
was
to
see
that
the
light
bulbs
were
spotless
so
i
learned
to
clean
the
bulbs
then
i
d
get
in
the
closet
with
a
book
a
flashlight
and
the
vacuum
and
sit
down
for
a
forty
five
minute
read
beady
eyes
glittered
with
malice
heh
heh
heh
elias
examined
the
bird
with
interest
i
sense
some
hostility
here
he
always
acts
like
that
charity
made
a
face
he
knows
it
irritates
me
and
after
all
i
ve
done
for
him
too
you
d
think
that
bird
would
show
some
gratitude
otis
cackled
again
i
took
him
in
after
hayden
died
you
know
charity
explained
he
was
extremely
depressed
moped
around
let
his
feathers
go
lost
his
appetite
it
was
terrible
he
was
in
such
bad
shape
i
was
afraid
to
leave
him
alone
during
the
day
he
sat
on
the
coatrack
in
my
back
room
office
i
kept
his
cage
in
my
bedroom
at
night
i
m
sure
he
s
grateful
elias
bird
that
bird
does
nt
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
crazy
otis
sidled
along
the
tree
limb
muttering
with
evil
glee
you
do
nt
know
how
lucky
you
were
otis
charity
said
no
one
else
on
the
pier
was
willing
to
take
charge
of
you
more
than
a
couple
of
people
suggested
that
we
try
to
sell
you
to
some
unsuspecting
tourist
and
one
individual
who
shall
go
unnamed
wanted
to
call
the
pound
and
have
you
taken
away
but
i
was
too
softhearted
to
allow
that
i
gave
you
shelter
food
free
rides
on
yappy
s
carousel
what
did
i
get
in
return
nothing
but
nasty
complaints
heh
heh
heh
otis
flapped
his
clipped
wings
take
it
easy
otis
elias
reached
out
with
one
long
fingered
hand
and
scratched
the
bird
s
head
an
obligation
exists
until
it
is
repaid
you
owe
her
crazy
otis
grumbled
but
he
stopped
chortling
contented
stupor
as
elias
stroked
his
feathers
amazing
charity
said
the
only
other
person
that
bird
ever
treated
as
an
equal
was
hayden
stone
everyone
else
is
just
so
much
old
newspaper
beneath
crazy
otis
s
grubby
claws
otis
and
i
had
a
long
talk
after
newlin
brought
him
over
here
yesterday
elias
said
he
and
i
have
decided
that
we
can
share
this
shop
together
that
s
a
relief
to
tell
you
the
truth
when
i
sent
newlin
down
here
with
that
nasty
beast
i
expected
you
to
refuse
to
take
him
in
all
fairness
crazy
otis
is
nt
your
responsibility
just
because
you
took
over
charms
virtues
does
nt
mean
you
have
to
take
charge
of
him
elias
gave
her
a
long
considering
look
otis
was
nt
your
responsibility
either
but
you
took
him
in
and
gave
him
a
home
for
the
past
two
months
there
was
nt
much
else
i
could
do
hayden
was
even
if
he
was
a
little
weird
the
fact
that
you
liked
hayden
did
nt
mean
that
you
had
to
take
care
of
otis
unfortunately
it
did
charity
sighed
somehow
crazy
otis
has
always
seemed
like
one
of
the
family
here
on
the
pier
a
particularly
unpleasant
relative
i
admit
one
i
d
prefer
to
keep
stashed
out
of
sight
in
the
attic
but
nevertheless
a
relation
and
you
know
what
they
say
about
your
relations
you
ca
nt
choose
them
you
have
to
take
what
you
get
i
understand
elias
stopped
rubbing
otis
s
head
and
picked
up
the
teapot
again
you
do
nt
have
to
keep
him
you
know
charity
said
in
a
burst
of
rash
honesty
he
s
not
a
very
lovable
bird
as
you
said
he
s
family
parrots
like
otis
have
long
life
spans
you
ll
be
saddled
with
him
for
years
cheered
by
the
fact
that
elias
was
not
going
to
change
his
mind
on
the
subject
otis
is
settled
now
about
this
situation
with
far
seas
yes
all
of
the
rents
on
the
pier
are
due
to
be
renegotiated
before
the
end
of
september
today
is
the
fourth
of
august
we
ve
got
to
act
quickly
just
what
action
do
you
plan
to
take
elias
set
down
the
teapot
as
i
said
we
want
to
approach
far
seas
as
a
united
front
charity
realized
with
a
start
that
she
was
staring
at
his
hands
they
were
very
interesting
hands
powerful
hands
imbued
with
a
striking
utterly
masculine
grace
a
united
front
elias
watched
her
as
she
hurriedly
raised
her
gaze
from
his
hands
to
his
face
right
united
she
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
the
color
of
the
sea
during
a
storm
a
bleak
steel
gray
her
fingers
clenched
around
the
clipboard
to
lock
in
long
term
leases
at
reasonable
rents
before
the
corporation
realizes
what
s
happening
here
in
whispering
waters
cove
what
is
happening
here
elias
s
mouth
curved
faintly
aside
from
the
impending
arrival
of
our
visitors
from
outer
space
i
see
you
ve
already
met
some
of
the
voyagers
it
s
a
little
hard
to
miss
them
on
the
street
true
charity
shrugged
they
re
quite
an
embarrassment
to
the
town
council
most
of
the
members
think
the
voyagers
give
whispering
waters
cove
a
bad
image
but
like
the
mayor
says
one
way
or
another
the
cult
should
be
gone
by
the
middle
of
august
what
happens
then
have
nt
you
heard
charity
grinned
gwendolyn
pitt
the
leader
of
the
group
has
told
her
followers
that
the
alien
spaceships
will
arrive
at
midnight
on
the
fifteenth
to
take
them
all
away
on
an
extended
tour
of
the
galaxy
during
said
tour
everyone
and
philosophical
enlightenment
i
ve
been
told
it
s
difficult
to
mix
the
two
yeah
well
evidently
the
aliens
have
mastered
the
problem
as
you
can
imagine
the
town
council
is
hoping
that
when
nothing
happens
that
night
the
voyagers
will
figure
out
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
hoax
and
will
leave
whispering
waters
cove
bright
and
early
on
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth
in
my
experience
people
tend
to
cling
to
a
belief
even
when
they
are
confronted
with
clear
evidence
that
it
s
false
well
it
wo
nt
bother
me
or
anyone
else
here
on
the
pier
if
some
of
them
decide
to
stay
in
the
area
charity
admitted
most
of
the
or
like

even
in

the

his

called

bernardo
took
only
coke
with
his
peanuts
so
esteban
did
the
same
though
he
felt
entitled
to
drink
whatever
he
wanted
because
this
was
a
significant
day
the
start
of
a
new
life
and
the
airline
ticket
had
cost
him
so
much
he
owed
his
charged
by
dona
adela
suarez
for
getting
him
the
job
after
two
months
on
the
urus
he
d
be
able
to

back
and
there
d
still
be
four
months
to
go
then
he
d
be
able
to
sign
on
for
a
whole
other
year

his
capitan
was
happy
enough
with
his
work

best
years
of

life

the
way
they
did
those

on

at

in

bernardo
looked
directly
at
esteban
the
forced
vehemence
of
his
expression
contradicted
by
the
clouded
softness
of
viejo
looked
away
his
tios
always
talked
like
that
if
not
quite
as
screwily
what
was
it
to
him
what
viejos
thought
except
chocho
why
did
they
always
seem
to
think
he
needed
to
hear
strong
opinions
and
that
he
must
be
full
of
strong
opinions
about
the
same
things
they
always
had
strong
opinions
about
seething
he
barely
listened
while
bernardo
chattered
on
about
his
years
working
as
a
chauffeur
in
managua
the
families
he
d
driven
for
including
one
related
to
the
petrocelis
bernardo
had
nt
touched
the
lunch
that
had
been
served
in
the
middle
of
his
life
story
esteban
had
glumly
passed
up
wine
again
but
now
the
viejito
punctured
the
wrapping
of
his
crackers
with
his
plastic
fork
carefully
peeled
yellow
wax
from
his
tablet
of
cheese
and
cut
the
cheese
into
thin
slivers
which
he
arrayed
over
two
crackers
it
was
all
he
ate
then
he
was
talking
about
his
daughters
again
esteban
devouring
the
gravy
soaked
beef
that
was
as
mushy
as
eggplant
in
just
a
few
forkfuls
viejo
s
youngest
daughter
looked
like
and
who
d
fixed
the
middle
one
leaving
her
with
child
when
she
was
what
fourteen
or
so
bernardo
said
that
his
daughters
paychecks
were
worthless
now
vaya
pues
like
everyone
s
he
felt
he
d
become
a
burden
to
them
disgracefully
he
had
nt
had
any
work
in
nearly
two
years
since
the
last
family
he
d
worked
for
had
suddenly
gone
to
live
in
venezuela
but
he
d
been
going
to
see
dona
adela
suarez
once
a
month
ever
since
pleading
with
her
to
convince
capitan
constantino
malevante
to
find
a
place
for
him
on
a
crew
despite
his
age
with
the
money
he
earns
on
this
voyage
muchacho
he
s
going
to
buy
two
chicken
incubators
then
he
ll
no
longer
be
a
burden
to
his
daughters
he
ll
have
a
dignified
old
age
because
people
always
need
chickens
and
eggs
especially
now
when
sometimes
in
managua
you
ca
nt
buy
a
chicken
or
even
an
egg
anywhere
son
a
country
running
out
of
chickens
he
brought
his
fist
down
onto
the
armrest
and
fell
silent
a
moment
the
shadow
of
a
crow
at
the
first
gesture
of
morning
flies
began
stirring
inman
s
eyes
and
the
long
wound
at
his
neck
drew
them
and
the
sound
of
their
wings
and
the
touch
of
their
feet
were
soon
more
potent
than
a
yardful
of
roosters
in
rousing
a
man
to
wake
so
he
came
to
yet
one
more
day
in
the
hospital
ward
he
flapped
the
flies
away
with
his
hands
and
looked
across
the
foot
of
his
bed
to
an
open
triple
hung
window
ordinarily
he
could
see
to
the
red
road
and
the
oak
tree
and
the
low
brick
wall
and
beyond
them
to
a
sweep
of
fields
and
flat
piney
woods
that
stretched
to
the
western
horizon
the
view
was
a
long
one
for
the
flatlands
the
hospital
having
been
built
on
the
only
swell
within
eyeshot
but
it
was
too
early
yet
for
a
vista
the
window
might
as
well
have
been
painted
grey
had
it
not
been
too
dim
inman
would
have
read
to
pass
the
time
until
breakfast
of
settling
his
mind
but
he
had
burned
up
the
last
of
his
own
candles
reading
to
bring
sleep
the
night
before
and
lamp
oil
was
too
scarce
to
be
striking
the
hospital
s
lights
for
mere
diversion
so
he
rose
and
dressed
and
sat
in
a
ladderback
chair
putting
the
gloomy
room
of
beds
and
their
broken
occupants
behind
him
he
flapped
again
at
the
flies
and
looked
out
the
window
at
the
first
smear
of
foggy
dawn
and
waited
for
the
world
to
begin
shaping
up
outside
the
window
was
tall
as
a
door
and
he
had
imagined
many
times
that
it
would
open
onto
some
other
place
and
let
him
walk
through
and
be
there
during
his
first
weeks
in
the
hospital
he
had
been
hardly
able
to
move
his
head
and
all
that
kept
his
mind
occupied
had
been
watching
out
the
window
and
picturing
the
old
green
places
he
recollected
from
home
childhood
places
the
damp
creek
bank
where
indian
pipes
grew
the
corner
of
a
meadow
favored
by
brown
and
black
caterpillars
in
the
and
from
which
he
often
watched
his
father
driving
cows
down
to
the
barn
at
dusk
they
would
pass
underneath
him
and
then
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
listen
as
the
cupping
sound
of
their
hooves
in
the
dirt
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
vanished
into
the
calls
of
katydids
and
peepers
the
window
apparently
wanted
only
to
take
his
thoughts
back
which
was
fine
with
him
for
he
had
seen
the
metal
face
of
the
age
and
had
been
so
stunned
by
it
that
when
he
thought
into
the
future
all
he
could
vision
was
a
world
from
which
everything
he
counted
important
had
been
banished
or
had
willingly
fled
by
now
he
had
stared
at
the
window
all
through
a
late
summer
so
hot
and
wet
that
the
air
both
day
and
night
felt
like
breathing
through
a
dishrag
so
damp
it
caused
fresh
sheets
to
sour
under
him
and
tiny
black
mushrooms
to
grow
overnight
from
the
limp
pages
of
the
book
on
his
bedside
table
inman
suspected
that
after
such
long
examination
the
grey
window
that
morning
though
it
surprised
him
for
it
brought
to
mind
a
lost
memory
of
sitting
in
school
a
similar
tall
window
beside
him
framing
a
scene
of
pastures
and
low
green
ridges
terracing
up
to
the
vast
hump
of
cold
mountain
it
was
september
the
hayfield
beyond
the
beaten
dirt
of
the
school
playground
stood
pant
waist
high
and
the
heads
of
grasses
were
turning
yellow
from
need
of
cutting
the
teacher
was
a
round
little
man
hairless
and
pink
of
face
he
owned
but
one
rusty
black
suit
of
clothes
and
a
pair
of
old
overlarge
dress
boots
that
curled
up
at
the
toes
and
were
so
worn
down
that
the
heels
were
wedgelike
he
stood
at
the
front
of
the
room
rocking
on
the
points
he
talked
at
length
through
the
morning
about
history
teaching
the
older
students
of
grand
wars
fought
in
ancient
england
after
a
time
of
actively
not
listening
the
young
inman
had
taken
his
hat
from
under
the
desk
and
held
it
by
its
brim
he
flipped
his
wrist
an
updraft
and
soared
it
landed
far
out
across
the
playground
at
the
edge
of
the
hayfield
and
rested
there
black
as
the
shadow
of
a
crow
squatted
on
the
ground
the
teacher
saw
what
inman
had
done
and
told
him
to
go
get
it
and
to
come
back
and
take
his
whipping
the
man
had
a
big
paddleboard
with
holes
augured
in
it
and
he
liked
to
use
it
inman
never
did
know
what
seized
him
at
that
moment
but
he
stepped
out
the
door
and
set
the
hat
on
his
head
at
a
dapper
rake
and
walked
away
never
to
return
the
memory
passed
on
as
the
light
from
the
window
rose
toward
day
the
man
in
the
bed
next
to
inman
s
sat
and
drew
his
crutches
to
him
as
he
did
every
morning
the
man
went
to
the
window
and
spit
repeatedly
and
with
great
effort
until
his
clogged
lungs
were
clear
he
ran
a
comb
through
his
black
hair
which
hung
lank
below
his
jaw
and
was
cut
square
around
he
tucked
put
on
his
spectacles
of
smoked
glass
which
he
wore
even
in
the
dim
of
morning
his
eyes
apparently
too
weak
for
the
wannest
form
of
light
then
still
in
his
nightshirt
he
went
to
his
table
and
began
working
at
a
pile
of
papers
he
seldom
spoke
more
than
a
word
or
two
at
a
time
and
inman
had
learned
little
more
of
him
than
that
his
name
was
balis
and
that
before
the
war
he
had
been
to
school
at
chapel
hill
where
he
had
attempted
to
master
greek
all
his
waking
time
was
now
spent
trying
to
render
ancient
scribble
from
a
fat
little
book
into
plain
the
folks
of
gil
antitoi
son
of
a
canadian
history
professor
from
urbana
to
events
like
the
central
illinois
open
in
decatur
a
town
built
and
owned
by
the
a
e
staley
processing
concern
and
so
awash
in
the
stink
of
roasting
corn
that
kids
would
play
with
bandannas
tied
over
their
mouths
and
noses
like
the
western
closed
qualifier
on
the
isu
campus
in
normal
like
the
mcdonald
s
junior
open
in
the
serious
corn
town
of
galesburg
way
out
west
by
the
river
like
the
prairie
state
open
in
pekin
insurance
hub
and
home
of
caterpillar
tractor
like
the
midwest
junior
clay
courts
at
a
chichi
private
club
in
peoria
s
pale
version
of
scarsdale
over
the
next
four
summers
i
got
to
see
way
more
of
the
state
than
is
normal
or
healthy
albeit
most
of
this
seeing
was
a
blur
of
travel
and
crops
looking
between
nod
outs
at
sunrises
abrupt
and
terribly
candent
over
the
crease
between
fields
and
sky
plus
you
could
it
came
around
the
earth
s
curve
and
the
only
part
of
proust
that
really
moved
me
in
college
was
the
early
description
of
the
kid
s
geometric
relation
to
the
distant
church
spire
at
combray
riding
in
station
wagons
backseats
through
saturday
dawns
and
sunday
sunsets
i
got
steadily
better
antitoi
unfairly
assisted
by
an
early
puberty
got
radically
better
by
the
time
we
were
fourteen
gil
antitoi
and
i
were
the
central
illinois
cream
of
our
age
bracket
usually
seeded
one
and
two
at
area
tournaments
able
to
beat
all
but
a
couple
of
even
the
kids
from
the
chicago
suburbs
who
together
with
a
contingent
from
grosse
pointe
mi
usually
dominated
the
western
regional
rankings
that
summer
the
best
fourteen
year
old
in
the
nation
was
a
chicago
kid
bruce
brescia
whose
penchant
for
floppy
white
tennis
hats
low
socks
with
bunnytails
at
the
heel
and
lurid
pastel
sweater
vests
testified
to
proclivities
that
would
nt
dawn
on
me
for
several
more
years
but
brescia
and
his
henchman
anything
but
the
midwestern
clays
and
some
indoor
events
in
cook
county
being
too
busy
jetting
off
to
like
the
pacific
hardcourts
in
ventura
and
junior
wimbledon
and
all
that
i
played
brescia
just
once
in
the
quarters
of
an
indoor
thing
at
the
rosemont
horizon
in
and
the
results
were
not
pretty
antitoi
actually
got
a
set
off
mees
in
the
national
qualifiers
one
year
neither
brescia
nor
mees
ever
turned
pro
i
do
nt
know
what
happened
to
either
of
them
after
eighteen
antitoi
and
i
ranged
over
the
exact
same
competitive
territory
he
was
my
friend
and
foe
and
bane
though
i
d
started
playing
two
years
before
he
he
was
bigger
quicker
and
basically
better
than
i
by
about
age
thirteen
and
i
was
soon
losing
to
him
in
the
finals
of
just
about
every
tournament
i
played
so
different
were
our
appearances
and
approaches
and
general
gestalts
that
we
had
something
of
an
epic
rivalry
from
through
i
had
gotten
so
prescient
at
using
stats
of
stoic
cheer
that
i
was
regarded
as
a
kind
of
physical
savant
a
medicine
boy
of
wind
and
heat
and
could
play
just
forever
sending
back
moonballs
baroque
with
spin
antitoi
uncomplicated
from
the
get
go
hit
the
everliving
shit
out
of
every
round
object
that
came
within
his
ambit
aiming
always
for
one
of
two
backcourt
corners
he
was
a
slugger
i
was
a
slug
when
he
was
on
i
e
having
a
good
day
he
varnished
the
court
with
me
when
he
was
nt
at
his
best
and
the
countless
hours
i
and
david
saboe
from
bloomington
and
kirk
riehagen
and
steve
cassil
of
danville
spent
in
meditation
and
seminar
on
just
what
variables
of
diet
sleep
romance
car
ride
and
even
sock
color
factored
into
the
equation
of
antitoi
s
mood
and
level
day
to
day
he
and
i
had
great
matches
real
marathon
wind
suckers
of
eleven
finals
we
played
in
i
won
two
midwest
junior
tennis
was
also
my
initiation
into
true
about
my
taoistic
ability
to
control
via
noncontrol
i
d
established
a
private
religion
of
wind
i
even
liked
to
bike
awfully
few
people
in
philo
bike
for
obvious
wind
reasons
but
i
d
found
a
way
to
sort
of
tack
back
and
forth
against
a
stiff
current
holding
some
wide
book
out
at
my
side
at
about
degrees
to
my
angle
of
thrust
bayne
and
pugh
s
the
art
of
the
engineer
and
cheiro
s
language
of
the
hand
proved
to
be
the
best
airfoils
so
that
through
imagination
and
verve
and
stoic
cheer
i
could
not
just
neutralize
but
use
an
in
your
face
gale
for
biking
similarly
by
thirteen
i
d
found
a
way
not
just
to
accommodate
but
to
employ
the
heavy
summer
winds
in
matches
no
longer
just
mooning
the
ball
down
the
center
to
allow
plenty
of
margin
for
error
and
swerve
i
was
now
able
to
use
the
currents
kind
of
the
way
a
pitcher
uses
spit
i
could
hit
curves
way
out
into
cross
breezes
that
d
drop
the
ball
just
fair
i
had
a
oval
in
the
air
and
curved
left
to
right
like
a
smart
slider
and
then
reversed
its
arc
on
the
bounce
i
d
developed
the
same
sort
of
autonomic
feel
for
what
the
wind
would
do
to
the
ball
that
a
standard
trans
driver
has
for
how
to
shift
as
a
junior
tennis
player
i
was
for
a
time
a
citizen
of
the
concrete
physical
world
in
a
way
the
other
boys
were
nt
i
felt
and
i
felt
betrayed
at
around
fourteen
when
so
many
of
these
single
minded
flailing
boys
became
abruptly
mannish
and
tall
with
sudden
sprays
of
hair
on
their
thighs
and
wisps
on
their
lips
and
ropy
arteries
on
their
forearms
my
fifteenth
summer
kids
i
d
been
beating
easily
the
year
before
all
of
a
sudden
seemed
overpowering
i
lost
in
two
semifinals
at
block
the
music
but
blurred
and
softened
it
absorbing
it
deep
within
the
wall
on
the
morning
of
tian
s
recital
i
woke
up
alone
as
i
lay
in
bed
listening
to
his
swooping
dizzying
warm
up
scales
i
suddenly
felt
our
narrow
room
pitch
up
and
down
like
a
ship
on
a
swell
i
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
staggered
to
the
bathroom
where
i
bent
down
and
seized
the
toilet
waiting
there
until
i
was
sick
as
i
knelt
against
the
cold
floor
and
vomited
again
i
understood
that
tian
and
i
would
have
a
child
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
spiritual
power
had
focused
upon
me
that
i
knelt
before
a
tablet
of
our
ancestors
i
wanted
to
meditate
burn
incense
as
a
sign
of
thanks
to
them
and
as
a
caution
against
any
harm
that
might
come
a
moment
later
i
found
myself
in
the
hallway
breathing
hard
my
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
to
tian
s
little
room
the
music
stopped
cautiously
i
turned
the
knob
but
he
had
not
heard
he
re
tuned
his
instrument
and
impatiently
began
his
piece
again
perhaps
it
would
not
be
wise
to
share
my
news
so
close
to
his
recital
after
all
we
had
not
planned
for
this
i
tiptoed
away
that
evening
we
had
a
light
dinner
and
left
early
we
boarded
the
subway
sitting
side
by
side
as
if
we
were
brother
and
sister
i
stretched
my
legs
in
front
of
me
to
make
him
notice
my
new
shoes
but
he
did
not
notice
i
stared
at
the
soft
black
shoes
myself
as
we
lurched
along
in
the
empty
car
the
steel
car
roared
and
rushed
we
held
tian
s
violin
case
over
our
laps
he
clutched
the
canvas
cover
tightly
the
fluorescent
lights
cast
bruised
shadows
on
his
high
sallow
cheekbones
and
but
i
felt
as
if
i
were
encased
in
a
bubble
of
happiness
and
illness
i
did
not
want
to
ruin
his
concentration
i
folded
my
gloved
trembling
hands
over
the
violin
case
i
had
dressed
protectively
in
a
hat
a
scarf
and
a
long
wool
coat
we
arrived
early
to
an
almost
empty
recital
hall
far
to
the
left
by
himself
sat
an
older
man
with
a
thick
head
of
gray
hair
and
a
big
mustache
this
tian
whispered
was
professor
spaeth
his
former
teacher
and
now
his
dean
every
now
and
then
someone
would
come
up
and
chat
with
spaeth
for
a
minute
or
two
but
his
responses
were
brief
and
none
of
the
visitors
stayed
for
long
tian
vanished
into
a
door
next
to
the
stage
i
sat
alone
in
the
third
row
too
shy
to
turn
around
and
watch
the
students
and
colleagues
who
came
in
groups
of
twos
or
threes
and
scattered
themselves
among
the
seats
they
spoke
fluently
as
carelessly
to
their
english
and
knew
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
hold
my
own
in
any
conversation
i
could
only
make
out
a
few
words
including
teacher
china
curious
before
i
came
to
this
country
i
felt
at
home
in
the
chinese
language
the
way
a
fish
feels
at
home
in
the
sea
when
i
came
to
new
york
i
vowed
to
practice
speaking
english
but
it
was
difficult
working
in
the
restaurant
i
did
not
talk
to
customers
i
did
not
own
a
television
i
took
classes
at
a
community
college
but
made
little
progress
with
the
humped
and
tangled
grammar
instead
i
spent
my
spare
time
reading
novels
i
bought
and
traded
with
the
other
waitresses
books
that
had
seduced
me
with
their
bright
familiar
covers
lined
up
along
the
shelves
in
the
chinatown
stores
now
as
i
sat
alone
i
was
overtaken
by
fear
i
longed
to
be
back
home
in
brooklyn
curled
up
in
tian
s
big
the
lights
dimmed
and
tian
took
the
stage
with
john
o
neill
his
accompanist
and
officemate
i
had
never
met
john
although
tian
often
spoke
about
him
and
i
was
surprised
by
his
height
his
reddish
beard
the
audience
gave
a
generous
welcome
the
clapping
died
down
the
two
men
bowed
then
took
their
places
tian
in
front
of
the
piano
his
bow
struck
the
strings
it
seemed
to
drop
from
above
the
way
a
hawk
will
plunge
with
sudden
swiftness
to
its
victim
tian
bent
and
swayed
in
the
vivid
light
dark
and
wild
and
foreign
altogether
unfamiliar
a
vein
in
his
right
jaw
which
i
had
only
briefly
noticed
rippled
and
stood
out
it
was
like
watching
a
man
have
a
seizure
he
terrified
me
his
music
shuddered
through
me
with
a
violence
i
am
not
sure
i
can
describe
now
delicate
and
now
enormous
but
always
more
powerful
than
his
swaying
fragile
figure
on
the
stage
i
felt
as
if
he
had
achieved
these
sounds
myself
pulling
away
from
him
my
back
pressed
tight
against
the
chair
how
could
i
have
chosen
such
an
unforgiving
man
i
knew
nothing
about
music
but
i
could
hear
in
these
sounds
a
man
who
would
accept
no
excuse
from
anyone
or
anything
close
to
him
the
violin
uncaged
from
the
practice
room
filled
the
recital
hall
with
a
clear
intensity
each
note
attacked
the
air
quick
and
piercing
as
a
dagger
i
fought
an
urge
to
run
from
the
auditorium
finally
he
stopped
there
came
a
prolonged
and
steady
storm
of
applause
i
kept
my
wet
hands
tightly
folded
tian
looked
straight
at
me
and
smiled
reappearing
from
this
monstrousness
then
i
did
applaud
he
raised
the
violin
and
began
his
next
piece
afterwards
we
stood
next
to
a
bowl
of
orange
punch
tian
spoke
to
the
people
who
crowded
us
sometimes
he
made
an
introduction
min
this
is
jennings
he
and
i
share
a
practice
locker
i
nodded
and
smiled
they
assured
me
so
i
nodded
and
smiled
again
sometimes
i
turned
to
tian
for
a
translation
but
he
seemed
to
be
having
problems
with
his
english
he
stumbled
over
certain
the
week
i
ll
just
use
the
phone
there
he
said
and
call
strathbane
and
then
i
ll
take
a
look
around
detective
chief
inspector
blair
when
contacted
said
he
was
busy
on
a
drugs
job
but
would
send
his
sidekick
jimmy
anderson
over
with
a
forensic
team
hamish
examined
the
hotel
office
apart
from
the
gaping
hole
in
the
back
of
the
safe
there
was
no
other
sign
of
a
break
in
that
he
could
see
you
discovered
this
in
the
on
here
last
night
there
was
a
ceilidh
how
many
people
about
a
hundred
or
so
but
the
office
was
locked
hamish
examined
the
office
door
it
was
wooden
with
a
frosted
glass
panel
the
lock
was
a
simple
yale
one
easily
picked
the
barman
and
the
waiter
were
brought
in
hamish
questioned
them
closely
they
had
nt
finished
their
duties
until
one
in
the
morning
and
then
had
gone
straight
to
bed
the
barman
johnny
king
was
a
sinister
looking
man
in
his
thirties
with
his
hair
worn
in
a
ponytail
and
his
thin
face
marred
by
a
long
scar
peter
sampson
the
waiter
was
a
small
smooth
faced
youth
of
about
twenty
after
he
had
finished
interviewing
them
hamish
walked
around
the
public
rooms
of
the
hotel
it
was
typical
of
the
more
depressing
type
of
highland
hotel
everything
in
pine
and
plastic
and
with
the
once
gaudy
carpets
looking
as
if
they
badly
needed
shampooing
tartan
curtains
hung
at
the
windows
shields
along
with
bad
murals
of
depressing
historical
events
like
the
battle
of
culloden
and
the
massacre
of
glencoe
the
artist
had
not
liked
bonnie
prince
charlie
for
there
he
was
with
a
cowardly
look
on
his
white
face
fleeing
the
battle
of
culloden
and
he
had
nt
liked
the
campbells
either
witness
their
savage
and
gleeful
faces
as
they
massacred
the
macdonalds
of
glencoe
what
s
the
polis
doing
here
demanded
a
shrill
voice
behind
him
he
swung
round
a
small
blonde
middle
aged
woman
stood
glaring
at
him
her
hair
was
wound
around
a
forest
of
pink
plastic
rollers
and
a
cigarette
hung
from
thin
lips
painted
orange
beside
her
stood
a
tall
sulky
girl
in
micro
skirt
and
black
suede
thigh
boots
fringed
suede
jacket
and
purple
blouse
her
makeup
was
dead
white
her
lipstick
purple
and
her
black
hair
gelled
into
spikes
mrs
macbean
aye

s
it
to
you
the
safe
in
the
office
was
broken
into
last
night
mrs
macbean
it
s
gone

gone
said
hamish
cool
said
darleen
her
eyes
were
flat
and
dead
valium
or
sheer
bovine
stupidity
thought
hamish
where
is
he
demanded
mrs
macbean
in
the
office
said
hamish
and
then
turned
away
as
he
heard
cars
driving
up
outside
he
went
out
to
meet
the
contingent
from
strathbane
detective
jimmy
anderson
s
foxy
features
lit
up
in
a
grin
when
he
saw
hamish
if
it
isnae
mr
death
hisself
he
said
cheerfully
where
s
the
body
wi
the
great
hamish
macbeth
on
the
scene
there
s
bound
to
be
a
body
no
body
the
safe
s
been
broken
into
like
i
told
you
i
figure
someone
from
the
hotel
did
it
aye
maybe
hamish
but
what
makes
you
think
that
i
chust
have
this
feeling
the
seer
of
lochdubh
jeered
jimmy
of
them
opening
up
that
bar
you
shouldnae
be
thinking
o
drinking
on
duty
said
hamish
primly
och
hamish
it
s
only
on
the
tv
that
they
say
things
like
that
and
in
police
regulations
if
you
paid
any
attention
to
police
regulations
you
would
smarten
up
that
horrible
uniform
your
trousers
are
so
shiny
i
can
see
ma
face
in
them
are
we
going
to
investigate
this
snapped
hamish
or
are
we
going
to
stand
here
all
day
trading
insults
where

body
then
said
jimmy
with
a
sigh
if
you
mean
the
safe
it
s
in
the
office
afore
you
go
in
jimmy
is
there
any
gossip
about
macbean
not
that
i
ve
heard
somat
enterprises
a
glasgow
company
who
owns
this
place
employed
him
two
years
ago
the
food
s
rotten
and
the
drinks
are
suspect
but
they
come
for
the
bingo
hamish
it
s
not
as
if
sutherland
is
a
swinging
place
no
competition
oh
well
lead
the
way
macbean
was
standing
outside
the
office
in
the
entrance
hall
through
the
open
office
door
the
white
coated
forensic
team
were
busy
dusting
everything
for
fingerprints
damn
muttered
hamish
two
of
the
men
turned
the
safe
around
their
fingerprints

be
on
it
i
ll
tell
them
said
jimmy
you
stupid
fool
mrs
macbean
suddenly
shouted
in
her
husband
s
face
one
pink
roller
shaken
loose
by
her
rage
fell
onto
the
carpet
i
tellt
ye
that
safe
was
silly
but
you
had
tae
go
and
dae
things
on
the
cheap
shut
your
face
growled
macbean
and
go
and
do
something
to
yourself
you
look
a
right
fright
with
them
curlers
in
hamish
s
tooth
gave
a
sinister
twinge
wait
a
bit
mrs
macbean
he
said
you
went
what
s
gilchrist
like
she
looked
at
him
in
amazement
it
wisnae
me
it
was
darleen
that
had
the
toothache
hamish
turned
questioningly
to
darleen
who
was
slumped
against
the
wall
studying
her
long
purple
fingernails
darleen
she
suddenly
opened
her
mouth
and
pointed
to
the
bottom
front
row
of
her
teeth
where
there
was
a
gap
he
pulled
your
tooth
too
right
could
nt
he
have
saved
it
whit
fur
because
teeth
can
be
saved
these
days
darleen
stifled
a
yawn
no
shit
sherlock
whit
the
hell
are
you
asking
questions
about
some
poxy
dentist
when
you
re
supposed
to
be
finding
out
who
burgled
my
safe
howled
macbean
i
m
working
on
something
else
said
hamish
jimmy
anderson
came
out
of
the
office
okay
i
ll
take
you
one
at
a
time
there
s
no
need
for
you
any
mair
papers
or
whatever
exciting
things
you
usually
do
in
lochdubh
hamish
went
reluctantly
there
was
an
odd
argued
emma
was
her
sister
and
her
major
source
of
gossip
know
what
else
she
says
julia
dean
got
a
postcard
mother
jane
pleaded
well
it
s
fact
dotty
argued
earl
saw
the
postcard
and
told
eliot
since
he
s
the
one
has
to
keep
peace
here
and
family
being
upset
can
she
s
here
the
postcard
was
from
her
daughter
in
des
moines
who
said
that
it
was
a
shame
that
julia
was
isolating
herself
and
that
she
understood
how
upset
she
had
been
by
daddy
s
death
that
they
all
were
but
three
years
of
mourning
should
be
enough
so
when
was
she
coming
home
all
that
on
a
postcard
bree
asked
she
did
nt
know
much
more
about
julia
than
that
she
had
opened
a
small
flower
store
three
years
before
and
twice
weekly
arranged
sprigs
in
the
diner
s
vases
she
came
by
for
an
occasional
meal
but
kept
to
herself
she
struck
bree
as
shy
but
sweet
certainly
not
the
type
to
deserve
being
the
butt
of
gossip
julia
s
family
does
nt
know
about
earl
jane
muttered
really
bree
glanced
toward
the
window
when
a
bright
light
swelled
there
another
eighteen
wheeler
pulling
into
the
parking
lot
and
then
dotty
said
with
a
glance
of
her
own
at
that
saw
another
ufo
eliot
says
the
lights
were
from
a
truck
but
she
insists
there
s
a
mark
on
the
back
of
her
car
where
that
mother
ship
tailed
her
leeann
leaned
closer
did
she
see
the
baby
ships
again
the
squiggly
little
pods
i
did
nt
ask
dotty
shuddered
that
woman
s
odd
bree
had
always
found
verity
more
amusing
than
odd
and
would
have
said
as
much
now
if
flash
had
nt
called
twenty
two
s
up
leeann
bree
stayed
leeann
with
a
touch
i
ll
get
it
she
topped
off
dotty
s
coffee
and
returned
the
carafes
to
their
heaters
scooping
up
the
chicken
piccata
with
angel
hair
that
was
ready
and
waiting
she
headed
down
the
counter
toward
the
booths
twenty
two
was
the
last
in
the
row
tucked
in
the
comer
by
the
jukebox
a
lone
man
sat
there
just
as
he
had
from
time
to
time
in
the
last
seven
months
he
never
said
much
like
now
he
was
reading
a
book
his
name
was
tom
gates
he
had
bought
the
hubbard
place
a
shingle
sided
bungalow
on
west
elm
that
had
nt
seen
a
stitch
of
improvement
in
all
the
years
that
the
hubbards
health
had
been
in
decline
since
tom
gates
had
taken
possession
missing
shingles
had
been
replaced
shutters
had
been
straightened
the
porch
had
been
painted
the
lawn
cut
what
had
happened
inside
was
more
murky
skipper
boone
had
rewired
the
place
and
the
wrights
had
installed
a
new
furnace
but
beyond
that
no
one
knew
and
bree
had
asked
she
had
always
loved
the
hubbard
place
though
smaller
than
her
victorian
it
had
ten
times
the
charm
she
might
have
bought
it
herself
if
she
d
had
the
nerve
but
she
had
inherited
her
own
house
from
her
father
who
had
inherited
it
from
his
millers
had
lived
on
south
forest
for
too
many
years
to
count
and
too
many
to
move
so
she
contented
herself
with
the
bungalow
on
west
elm
none
of
those
bits
came
from
tom
gates
he
was
nt
sociable
good
looking
very
good
looking
too
good
looking
to
be
alone
but
not
sociable
here
you
go
bree
said
when
he
moved
his
book
aside
she
slid
the
plate
in
she
wiped
her
palms
on
the
back
of
her
jeans
and
pushed
her
hands
in
the
pockets
there
reading
anything
good
his
eyes
shifted
from
his
dinner
back
to
the
book
it
s
okay
she
tipped
her
head
to
see
the
title
but
the
whole
front
looked
to
be
typed
weird
cover
it
has
nt
been
published
yet
really
how
d
you
get
it
i
know
someone
the
author
when
he
shook
his
head
the
diner
s
light
shimmered
in
hair
that
was
shiny
light
brown
and
a
mite
too
long
are
you
a
reviewer
she
asked
he
shifted
then
she
decided
not
that
he
looked
scholarly
he
was
too
tanned
too
tall
too
broad
in
the
shoulders
coming
and
going
he
strode
flash
bet
that
he
was
a
politician
who
had
lost
a
dirty
election
and
fled
dotty
bet
he
was
a
burned
out
businessman
because
earl
told
of
mail
from
new
york
leeann
bet
he
was
an
adventurer
recouping
after
a
tiring
trek
bree
could
see
him
as
an
adventurer
he
had
that
rugged
look
his
buying
a
house
in
town
did
nt
mean
much
even
adventurers
needed
to
rest
sometimes
but
they
did
nt
stay
put
for
long
panama
bored
men
who
loved
risk
this
one
would
be
gone
before
long
it
was
a
shame
because
tom
gates
had
great
hands
he
had
long
lean
blunt
tipped
fingers
and
moved
them
in
a
way
that
suggested
they
could
do
most
anything
they
tried
bree
had
never
once
seen
dirt
under
his
nails
which
set
him
apart
from
most
of
the
men
who
calluses
those
men
did
his
hands
looked
well
used
he
had
cut
himself
several
months
back
and
had
needed
stitches
the
scar
was
nearly
two
inches
long
and
starting
to
fade
i
just
finished
the
new
dean
koontz
she
said
have
you
read
it
yet
he
was
studying
his
fork
no
it
s
pretty
good
worth
a
shot
can
i
get
you
anything
else
another
beer
she
hitched
her
chin
toward
the
longneck
on
the
far
side
of
his
plate
you
know
that
s
local
do
nt
you
sleepy
creek
pale
it
s
brewed
down
the
street
his
eyes
met
hers
they
were
wonderfully
gray
yes
he
said
i
do
know
she
might
have
been
lured
by
those
eyes
to
say
something
else
had
not
the
front
door
opened
just
then
to
a
flurry
of
flakes
and
the
stamping
boots
of
four
truckers
shaking
snow
a
whole
month
s
rent
there
was
a
rush
to
his
voice
a
desperation
i
m
not
sure
i
said
i
was
caught
off
guard
but
i
did
nt
want
to
say
no
immediately
and
hurt
him
reject
him
i
think
we
d
get
along
fine
and
you
only
have
to
try
it
for
a
week
he
said
we
can
even
make
it
per
diem
nine
no
eight
dollars
a
day
i
ll
do
it
i
blurted
out
suddenly
i
ll
give
it
a
try
what
moments
before
had
been
out
of
the
question
w
as
now
the
path
i
had
leaped
upon
i
changed
my
life
without
a
moment
s
because
he
wanted
me
i
was
responding
to
that
i
was
flattered
i
wanted
to
be
wanted
this
will
be
very
good
for
you
he
said
and
he
sounded
happy
there
s
much
i
can
teach
you
about
new
york
you
know
i
can
advance
you
socially
his
voice
was
confident
again
regal
that
would
be
very
nice
of
you
i
said
my
heart
was
pounding
i
think
we
both
felt
giddy
his
wanting
me
and
my
accepting
of
his
wanting
had
both
of
us
rejoicing
i
gushed
to
him
perhaps
revealing
too
much
it
s
really
very
strange
that
i
ll
be
moving
to
new
york
it
s
all
because
i
was
looking
at
the
cover
of
henry
james
s
washington
square
and
i
thought
i
should
be
in
new
york
i
ca
nt
stand
james
he
proclaimed
he
s
unreadable
i
know
what
you
mean
i
was
worried
that
i
up
for
myself
and
james
a
little
bit
by
saying
but
the
earlier
books
are
quite
good
like
daisy
miller
or
washington
square
yes
that
s
true
his
style
did
change
i
wonder
why
he
burned
himself
you
know
sat
on
a
stove
and
shriveled
his
testicles
that
may
account
for
the
change
in
style
he
laughed
and
i
laughed
with
him
but
it
was
hard
to
know
what
to
expect
from
him
the
issue
of
sex
was
unclear
i
was
nt
sure
if
he
was
heterosexual
homosexual
or
if
he
was
some
kind
of
bawdy
puritan
but
this
uncertainty
did
nt
bother
me
i
found
it
intriguing
and
familiar
i
told
him
that
i
would
need
a
little
time
to
tie
things
up
in
princeton
and
that
i
d
move
in
as
close
to
the
first
of
september
as
possible
this
was
suitable
to
him
and
we
rang
off
lt
i
did
nt
give
my
park
place
landlord
sufficient
notice
but
he
returned
hastily
but
i
felt
drawn
to
new
york
and
to
henry
harrison
it
was
my
perception
that
mr
harrison
was
a
gentleman
and
that
i
was
a
fledgling
gentleman
and
so
we
would
be
well
suited
for
one
another
i
had
been
acting
like
a
novice
gentleman
for
almost
six
years
it
started
in
my
sophomore
year
at
rutgers
when
i
began
to
address
myself
in
my
thoughts
as
the
young
gentleman
and
i
think
its
precise
beginning
was
after
i
read
w
somerset
maugham
s
the
razor
s
edge
and
evelyn
waugh
s
brideshead
revisited
in
too
close
a
succession
then
there
followed
fitzgerald
and
wodehouse
and
wilde
and
mann
and
i
came
to
only
want
to
read
books
about
young
gentlemen
for
me
they
were
like
don
quixote
s
books
of
chivalry
i
tried
to
live
as
the
young
gentlemen
lived
i
wrote
thank
you
notes
and
i
enjoyed
train
travel
i
shaved
daily
ate
solitary
meals
and
dressed
neatly
i
used
the
authors
themselves
as
models
i
attempted
to
dress
like
wore
sneakers
favored
pants
with
texture
linen
wool
or
corduroy
and
went
to
italian
barbers
for
short
haircuts
so
i
developed
a
style
a
manner
of
living
it
was
a
fantasy
that
i
wore
like
armor
to
get
me
through
the
day
and
to
enjoy
the
day
it
made
loneliness
feel
like
a
movie
a
typical
saturday
in
princeton
sounded
like
this
in
my
mind
the
young
gentleman
strolls
up
nassau
street
he
wears
his
blue
blazer
he
goes
to
his
favorite
restaurant
the
annex
for
his
luncheon
he
sits
at
his
bachelor
table
and
reads
the
paper
while
he
eats
he
is
kindly
to
the
anc
ient
waitresses
for
his
digestion
the
young
gentleman
strolls
some
more
he
stops
at
micawber
s
bookstore
greets
the
hardworking
proprietor
and
browses
he
is
one
of
the
legions
who
browse
and
rarely
buy
but
the
proprietorappreciates
the
young
gentleman
his
dignified
manner
his
wearing
of
a
tie
the
young
gentleman
walks
to
palmer
square
and
sits
and
desire
his
company
the
young
gentleman
smiles
but
remains
aloof
he
watches
the
packs
of
young
girls
get
ice
cream
at
thomas
sweet
s
he
sniffs
the
air
as
they
walk
past
him
hoping
to
catch
a
hint
of
young
perspiration
helooks
at
their
sugary
mouths
their
thin
legs
and
arms
their
ice
cream
cones
he
wants
to
run
home
and
hide
in
bed
he
s
nothing
but
an
onanist
unfortunately
i
was
always
dissolving
into
overly
lonesome
thoughts
which
turned
sexual
out
of
desperation
but
that
sample
day
illustrates
very
well
the
young
gentleman
s
life
the
idea
was
to
establish
a
routine
routines
were
romantic
young
and
old
gentlemen
had
them
you
went
about
your
routines
quietly
but
people
took
notice
and
admired
you
i
wanted
them
to
be
able
to
count
on
me
appearing
at
the
annex
on
saturdays
it
was
like
being
a
force
of
nature
a
robin
redbreast
who
returns
to
the
same
tree
every
spring
a
young
gentleman
in
a
blue
that
i
had
done
a
good
tour
of
duty
in
princeton
people
did
nt
know
me
but
they
would
miss
me
and
now
i
wanted
to
go
live
with
henry
harrison
he
was
a
fellow
gentleman
he
wanted
to
advance
me
socially
i
did
nt
really
think
he
could
advance
me
but
the
fact
that
he
said
such
a
thing
inspired
me
i
had
been
living
as
find
every
reason
to
mention
it
in
front
of
the
women
who
look
at
eva
the
men
who
stare
at
jiri
to
discern
what
secret
quality
can
make
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex
behave
so
shamelessly
the
sweet
unlikely
promise
of
february
in
prague
now
traffic
stalls
in
a
stagnant
pool
of
exhaust
that
makes
landau
s
eyes
burn
outside
the
window
a
roadside
stand
sells
huge
stuffed
animals
plush
neon
pink
panthers
with
black
button
noses
sucking
up
pollution
landau
nudges
his
seatmate
a
depressed
albanian
novelist
the
albanian
glances
over
and
nods
and
emits
a
tragic
snort
even
in
the
august
heat
the
albanian
wears
a
scratchy
brown
cardigan
a
muffler
of
the
same
fabric
bandages
his
throat
at
the
welcome
cocktail
party
the
whole
congress
overheard
jiri
complimenting
the
albanian
s
outfit
recalling
how
in
the
camps
he
d
worn
every
scrap
of
scrounged
clothing
if
you
slipped
into
something
more
comfortable
everything
else
you
owned
was
stolen
the
albanian
had
made
the
same
melancholy
snort
with
which
he
s
just
responded
to
landau
and
what
is
jiri
wearing
an
expensive
pale
blue
silk
shirt
with
the
top
buttons
undone
revealing
a
freckled
chest
thatched
with
white
hair
and
even
to
go
to
the
camp
he
changed
his
mind
ten
times
erasing
and
rewriting
his
name
until
he
dug
a
hole
in
the
sign
up
sheet
he
hates
to
think
of
the
holocaust
or
rather
he
feels
it
too
deeply
unlike
all
those
slobs
who
take
dates
to
schindler
s
list
so
they
can
provide
a
manly
shoulder
for
their
girls
to
burrow
their
faces
in
during
the
scene
in
which
the
naked
female
prisoners
do
nt
know
if
the
shower
will
spray
water
or
poison
gas
is
nt
there
something
by
definition
obscene
about
guided
tours
of
hellexcept
of
course
if
you
re
dante
yet
plenty
of
people
visit
the
camp
for
as
many
different
reasons
at
the
last
minute
landau
decided
to
go
to
shut
up
and
take
his
medicine
maybe
it
would
do
him
good
just
as
working
with
children
was
supposed
to
be
good
for
felice
and
it
is
nt
as
if
he
s
making
a
special
effort
going
out
of
his
way
to
satisfy
a
ghoulish
curiosity
the
whole
kafka
perfectly
normal
landau
will
probably
feel
left
out
if
he
does
nt
go
also
he
d
hate
to
look
like
a
coward
who
ca
nt
even
visit
the
camp
where
jiri
spent
three
hellish
years
which
is
another
reason
not
to
go
the
camp
is
jiri
s
kingdom
they
turn
a
corner
and
there
it
is
a
solid
brick
fortress
not
unlike
the
state
colleges
built
after
the
vietnam
war
after
students
like
landau
ran
around
smashing
windows
and
there
is
the
sign
over
the
gate
arbeit
macht
frei
work
makes
you
free
oh
the
fabulous
ironies
of
the
german
sense
of
humor
and
how
amazing
how
incredible
that
you
can
see
it
from
a
tour
bus
which
for
the
first
time
since
they
left
prague
hits
a
reasonable
speed
and
zips
past
the
camp
then
past
parking
lots
crammed
with
dusty
cars
campers
and
fully
loaded
german
made
rvs
the
passengers
murmur
anxiously
could
they
have
missed
their
stop
wait
this
bus
was
hired
to
take
them
calming
hand
the
bus
is
just
going
to
parkmiles
away
from
the
camp
how
will
the
frail
israeli
rabbi
manage
the
long
hike
back
but
first
they
must
drive
past
another
tourist
attraction
eva
kaprova
points
out
the
national
memorial
cemetery
the
tidy
straight
rows
of
pale
identical
markers
over
which
the
state
has
recently
erected
a
monumental
gleaming
silver
cross
the
passengers
fall
silent
and
gaze
dully
at
the
cross
then
something
startling
happens
jiri
lopes
to
the
front
of
the
bus
he
turns
to
mug
at
his
colleagues
and
with
broad
clownish
gestures
spreads
his
arms
out
wide
as
if
he
is
hanging
on
the
cross
but
he
does
nt
look
like
jesus
jiri
s
in
much
better
shape
a
condor
about
to
flap
its
wings
and
fly
up
through
the
bus
ceiling
the
conferees
gaze
at
him
worshipfully
why
did
landau
come
here
he
d
told
himself
it
would
be
worth
it
for
the
free
ticket
to
prague
and
let
s
be
honest
he
was
flattered
that
he
d
been
somehow
crossed
the
ocean
the
bus
squeezes
into
a
parking
space
its
passengers
do
nt
notice
they
go
on
staring
at
jiri
until
he
collapses
his
arms
and
laughs
the
moment
s
over
they
too
can
laugh
and
be
released
to
stand
and
gather
their
things
and
follow
jiri
off
the
bus
and
up
the
road
to
the
camp
the
kafka
congress
flocks
around
eva
kaprova
who
collects
them
on
the
drawbridge
and
invites
them
to
look
down
at
the
moat
that
the
nazi
engineers
designed
so
they
could
flood
it
in
an
emergency
with
water
from
the
nearby
river
landau
stares
down
into
the
weedy
moat
which
is
dry
of
course
and
littered
with
paper
broken
glass
eastern
european
landscaping
the
parching
sun
sears
the
back
of
his
neck
he
lifts
his
head
too
quickly
and
tiny
black
spots
swim
before
his
eyes
oh
god
what
if
he
faints
here
kafka
s
castle
says
eva
with
a
bitter
actressy
chuckle
but
no
one
s
paying
attention
gone
ahead
of
them
and
is
heading
into
the
camp
what
is
it
like
for
jiri
to
walk
up
that
cobblestone
road
and
under
that
soot
blackened
stone
arch
could
this
be
the
first
time
since
landau
ca
nt
help
wondering
but
jiri
s
beyond
cheap
psychology
or
sentimental
melodrama
he
enters
the
camp
like
its
owner
a
hero
or
messenger
storming
the
fortress
with
urgent
news
for
the
king
the
kafka
congress
ditches
poor
eva
and
rushes
ducklinglike
up
the
path
scurrying
after
mr
pied
piper
even
the
elderly
rabbi
lifts
his
cuffs
and
hurries
landau
lingers
watching
eva
s
generous
sullen
mouth
droop
even
lower
as
she
shades
her
eyes
with
let
me
kill
him
cara
said
her
boot
strikes
sounding
like
rawhide
mallets
hammering
the
polished
marble
floor
the
supple
leather
boots
kahlan
wore
beneath
her
elegant
white
confessor
s
dress
whispered
against
the
cold
stone
as
she
tried
to
keep
pace
without
letting
her
legs
break
into
a
run
no
cara
exhibited
no
response
keeping
her
blue
eyes
ahead
to
the
wide
corridor
stretching
into
the
distance
a
dozen
leather
and
chain
mail
clad
d
haran
soldiers
their
unadorned
swords
sheathed
or
crescent
bladed
battle
axes
hooked
on
belt
hangers
crossed
at
an
intersection
just
ahead
though
their
weapons
were
nt
drawn
every
wooden
hilt
was
gripped
in
a
ready
fist
as
vigilant
eyes
scrutinized
the
shadows
among
the
doorways
and
columns
to
each
side
their
hasty
bows
toward
kahlan
only
briefly
interrupted
their
attention
to
their
task
we
ca
nt
just
kill
him
kahlan
explained
we
need
answers
an
eyebrow
lifted
over
one
icy
blue
eye
oh
i
did
nt
say
he
would
answer
any
question
you
have
when
i
m
finished
with
him
a
mirthless
smile
ghosted
across
her
flawless
face
that
is
the
job
of
a
mord
sith
getting
people
to
answer
questions
she
paused
as
the
smile
returned
to
widen
with
professional
satisfaction
before
they
die
kahlan
heaved
a
sigh
cara
that
s
no
longer
your
job
your
life
your
job
now
is
to
protect
richard
that
is
why
you
should
let
me
kill
him
we
should
not
take
a
risk
by
letting
this
man
live
no
we
first
have
to
find
out
what
s
going
on
and
we
re
not
going
to
start
out
doing
it
the
way
you
want
cara
s
smile
humorless
as
it
was
had
vanished
again
as
you
wish
mother
confessor
kahlan
wondered
how
the
woman
had
managed
to
change
into
her
skintight
red
leather
outfit
so
fast
whenever
there
was
so
much
as
a
whiff
of
trouble
at
least
one
of
the
three
mord
sith
red
as
they
often
pointed
out
did
nt
show
blood
are
you
sure
he
said
that
this
man
those
were
his
words
yes
mother
confessor
his
exact
words
you
should
let
me
kill
him
before
he
has
a
chance
to
try
to
bring
them
to
pass
kahlan
ignored
the
repeated
request
as
they
hurried
on
down
the
hall
where
s
richard
you
wish
me
to
get
lord
rahl
no
i
just
want
to
know
where
he
is
in
case
there
s
trouble
i
would
say
that
this
qualifies
as
trouble
you
said
that
there
must
be
two
hundred
soldiers
holding
weapons
on
him
how
much
trouble
can
one
man
cause
with
all
those
swords
axes
and
arrows
pointed
at
him
my
former
master
darken
rahl
knew
that
steel
alone
could
not
always
ward
danger
that
is
why
he
had
mord
sith
nearby
and
at
the
ready
that
evil
man
were
really
a
danger
to
him
richard
is
nt
like
that
and
neither
am
i
you
know
that
if
there
is
a
true
threat
i
m
not
shy
about
eliminating
it
but
if
this
man
is
more
than
he
seems
then
why
is
he
so
timidly
cowering
before
all
that
steel
besides
as
a
confessor
i
am
hardly
defenseless
against
threats
that
steel
wo
nt
stop
we
have
to
keep
our
heads
let
s
not
start
leaping
to
judgments
that
may
be
unwarranted
if
you
do
nt
think
he
could
be
trouble
then
why
am
i
nearly
running
to
just
keep
up
with
you
kahlan
realized
that
she
was
a
half
a
step
ahead
of
the
woman
she
slowed
her
pace
to
a
brisk
walk
because
it
s
richard
we
re
talking
about
she
said
in
a
near
whisper
cara
smirked
you
re
as
worried
as
i
of
course
i
am
but
for
all
we
know
killing
this
man
if
he
is
you
could
be
right
but
that
is
the
purpose
for
mord
sith
so
where
is
richard
cara
gripped
the
red
leather
at
her
wrist
and
stretched
her
armor
backed
glove
tighter
onto
her
hand
as
she
flexed
her
fist
her
agiel
an
awesome
weapon
that
appeared
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
finger
width
foot
long
red
leather
rod
dangled
from
a
fine
gold
chain
at
her
right
wrist
ever
at
the
ready
one
just
like
it
but
no
weapon
in
kahlan
s
hands
hung
on
a
chain
around
kahlan
s
neck
it
had
been
a
gift
from
richard
a
gift
that
symbolized
the
pain
and
sacrifice
they
had
both
endured
he
is
out
behind
the
palace
in
one
of
the
private
parks
cara
gestured
over
her
shoulder
the
one
that
way
raina
and
berdine
are
with
him
kahlan
was
relieved
to
hear
that
the
other
two
mord
sith
were
watching
over
him
something
to
do
with
his
surprise
for
me
what
told
you
cara
cara
snatched
a
glimpse
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
of
course
he
has
told
me
then
what
is
it
he
also
told
me
not
to
tell
you
kahlan
shrugged
i
wo
nt
tell
him
that
you
told
me
cara
s
laugh
like
her
smile
before
bore
no
humor
lord
rahl
has
a
peculiar
way
of
finding
out
things
especially
those
things
you
wish
him
not
to
know
kahlan
knew
the
truth
of
that
so
what
s
he
doing
out
there
the
muscles
in
cara
s
jaw
flexed
outdoor
things
you
know
lord
rahl
he
likes
to
do
outdoor
things
kahlan
glanced
over
to
see
that
cara
s
face
had
turned
nearly
as
red
as
her
leather
outfit
what
sort
of
outdoor
things
cara
cleared
her
throat
into
her
armored
fist
he
is
taming
chipmunks
he
s
what
i
ca
nt
hear
you
said
that
the
chipmunks
have
come
out
to
test
the
warming
weather
he
is
taming
them
her
cheeks
rounded
as
she
huffed
with
seeds
kahlan
smiled
at
the
thought
of
richard
the
man
she
loved
the
man
who
had
seized
command
of
d
hara
and
had
much
of
the
midlands
now
eating
out
of
lover
for
almost
two
years
marcus
he
laughed
low
thats
far
longer
than
anyone
has
lasted
since
at
the
expression
on
marcus
face
he
raised
a
tell
me
you
parted
with
her
amicably
arria
was
still
beautiful
still
intent
on
gaining
the
adoration
of
every
male
in
the
room
still
amoral
and
eager
for
any
new
excitement
however
marcus
saw
subtle
changes
the
soft
loveliness
of
youth
had
given
way
to
a
harder
edged
worldliness
her
laughter
held
no
exuberance
or
pleasure
rather
it
carried
a
quality
of
brashness
and
crudity
that
grated
several
men
hovered
around
her
and
she
alternately
teased
each
making
jokes
at
their
expense
and
offering
whispered
suggestive
observations
she
glanced
across
the
room
then
looking
at
marcus
in
question
he
knew
she
was
wondering
why
he
had
nt
been
caught
by
the
smile
she
had
cast
him
when
he
came
in
but
he
knew
that
smile
for
what
it
was
bait
for
a
hungry
fish
unfortunately
for
arria
marcus
was
not
hungry
not
any
longer
antigonus
leaned
closer
see
how
she
looks
at
you
marcus
you
could
have
her
back
with
a
snap
of
your
fingers

lacks
in
wit
he
more
than
makes
up
for
in
money
he
s
almost
as
rich
as
you
are
but
then
our
little
arria
has
money
of
her
own
these
days
her
book
created
quite
a
furor
book
marcus
said
and
gave
a
sardonic
laugh
i
did
nt
know
arria
could
write
her
name
let
alone
string
enough
words
together
to
make
a
sentence
obviously
you
know
nothing
of
what
she
s
written
or
you
would
nt
be
making
light
of
it
its
hardly
a
laughing
matter
our
little
arria
had
secret
talents
unbeknownst
to
us
she
s
become
a
woman
of
letters
or
more
precisely
erotica
a
do
all
tell
all
collection
of
stories
by
the
gods
its
stirred
up
trouble
in
high
places
one
senator
lost
his
wife
over
it
not
that
he
minded
the
loss
of
the
woman
but
her
family
connections
cost
him
dearly
rumor
has
it
he
may
be
forced
into
suicide
arria
i
think
she
s
addicted
to
scandal
she
has
scribes
working
night
and
day
making
copies
of
her
little
tome
the
price
for
one
copy
is
exorbitant
which
you
undoubtedly
paid
marcus
said
dryly
but
of
course
antigonus
said
with
a
laugh
i
wanted
to
see
if
she
would
mention
me
she
did
in
chapter
eleven
to
my
dismay
it
was
a
rather
cursory
mention
he
glanced
at
marcus
with
an
amused
smile
she
wrote
about
you
in
detailand
at
length
no
wonder
sarapais
was
so
enamored
of
you
at
the
games
the
other
day
she
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
all
arria
said
you
were
he
grinned
you
should
buy
a
copy
for
yourself
and
read
it
marcus
it
might
bring
back
a
few
sweet
memories
for
all
her
exquisite
beauty
arria
is
crass
and
best
forgotten
a
rather
cruel
assessment
of
a
woman
you
once
loved
is
nt
it
antigonus
marcus
turned
his
attention
to
the
dancing
girls
undulating
before
him
the
bells
on
their
ankles
and
wrists
jingled
grating
on
his
nerves
rather
than
be
aroused
by
the
boldness
of
their
sensual
dance
and
transparently
veiled
bodies
he
felt
discomfited
he
wished
their
performance
would
end
and
they
would
depart
antigonus
reached
out
to
grasp
one
of
the
women
and
pulled
her
down
onto
his
lap
despite
her
struggling
he
kissed
her
passionately
when
he
drew
back
he
laughed
and
said
to
marcus
pick
one
for
yourself
the
slave
girl
cried
out
and
the
sound
sent
marcus
insides
instinctively
recoiling
he
had
seen
the
look
on
the
girls
face
before
in
hadassah
s
eyes
when
he
had
let
his
own
passions
burn
out
of
control
let
her
go
antigonus
others
were
watching
antigonus
laughing
and
calling
out
encouragement
drunk
and
provoked
antigonus
became
rougher
in
his
determination
to
have
his
way
the
girl
screamed
marcus
found
himself
on
his
feet
let
her
staring
at
marcus
in
astonishment
laughing
antigonus
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
him
in
mild
surprise
his
laughter
died
alarmed
he
rolled
to
one
side
releasing
the
girl
weeping
hysterically
she
stumbled
to
her
feet
and
scrambled
away
antigonus
regarded
marcus
quizzically
my
apologies
marcus
if
you
wanted
her
that
badly
why
did
nt
you
say
so
earlier
marcus
felt
arrias
eyes
fixed
on
him
like
hot
coals
burning
with
jealousy
he
wondered
fleetingly
what
punishment
the
slave
girl
would
receive
at
arrias
hands
for
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
i
did
nt
want
the
girl
he
said
tersely
nor
any
other
in
this
room
whispers
rippled
several
women
glanced
at
arria
and
smirked
antigonus
countenance
darkened
then
why
intrude
upon
my
pleasure
you
were
about
to
rape
the
girl
antigonus
laughed
dryly
rape
given
another
moment
she
would
have
enjoyed
it
i
doubt
that
the
insult
since
when
did
a
slaves
feelings
matter
to
you
i
ve
seen
you
take
your
pleasure
in
like
ways
a
time
or
two
i
do
nt
need
to
be
reminded
marcus
said
grimly
downing
the
remainder
of
the
wine
in
his
cup
what
i
do
need
is
a
breath
of
fresh
air
he
went
out
into
the
gardens
but
found
no
relief
there
for
arria
followed
him
merula
at
her
side
gritting
his
teeth
marcus
bore
their
presence
she
talked
about
their
love
affair
as
though
it
had
ended
yesterday
and
not
four
years
before
merula
glared
at
marcus
who
felt
pity
for
the
man
arria
had
always
enjoyed
tormenting
her
lovers
have
you
read
my
book
marcus
she
said
her
voice
dripping
honey
no
its
quite
good
you
d
enjoy
it
i
ve
lost
my
taste
for
trash
he
said
his
gaze
flickering
over
her
her
eyes
flashed
her
face
contorted
with
rage
you
were
the
worst
lover
i
ever
had
marcus
grinned
back
at
her
coldly
thats
because
im
the
only
one
who
walked
flies
with
no
wings
run
and
jump
off
their
hind
legs
only
to
land
on
their
faces
i
have
splattered
flies
and
decapitated
them
to
splatter
a
fly
in
one
straight
shot
i
have
discovered
is
nt
nearly
as
entertaining
as
breaking
it
down
bit
by
bit
wing
by
leg
by
head
since
the
first
day
i
was
escorted
to
my
quarters
i
have
sent
three
hundred
twenty
three
flies
down
the
incineration
chute
to
the
fire
i
have
killed
flies
on
every
wall
under
my
bed
in
the
shower
and
the
sink
i
have
even
splattered
one
directly
on
the
lens
of
a
surveillance
camera
i
have
of
collecting
them
i
would
like
to
label
and
pin
them
to
rows
of
styrofoam
and
catalogue
them
in
wooden
drawers
of
course
i
would
never
be
allowed
but
i
do
relish
the
idea
i
ca
nt
help
but
wonder
whether
if
i
had
any
concrete
memories
of
the
past
i
would
be
fascinated
with
such
things
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
do
nt
i
do
nt
know
why
this
is
or
why
it
has
to
be
i
have
asked
i
have
asked
and
i
have
been
ignored
and
have
been
dealt
with
so
i
stopped
asking
after
some
time
now
among
other
things
i
chase
flies
when
i
am
away
from
my
duties
when
the
dizziness
from
my
injection
passes
i
wash
my
hands
and
my
face
with
surgical
scrub
then
change
my
shoes
and
my
uniform
i
send
the
smock
mask
and
rubber
gloves
down
the
incinerator
chute
and
continue
toward
the
interoffice
elevator
bank
in
order
to
gather
supplies
for
the
midnight
movie
more
than
nine
minutes
and
thirty
seconds
should
an
attendant
think
of
taking
half
steps
or
shortcuts
through
this
procedure
he
can
be
demoted
up
to
percent
against
his
debt
the
current
yield
on
his
debt
will
appreciate
x
months
later
than
current
appreciation
date
number
of
months
are
determined
by
the
level
of
the
infraction
the
regulation
of
half
steps
and
shortcuts
applies
to
all
procedures
for
which
all
staff
members
are
responsible
it
is
known
as
the
liability
doctrine
in
short
if
any
half
step
or
shortcut
is
taken
through
any
procedure
we
are
liable
for
our
lack
of
thoroughness
and
or
attention
to
detail
even
when
such
thoroughness
and
or
attention
to
detail
is
dependent
on
another
staff
member
this
dependency
on
other
staff
members
makes
for
interdependence
every
week
since
i
have
been
poppy
s
ward
i
have
been
suffering
from
a
lack
of
interdependence
i
have
been
demoted
once
a
week
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
because
poppy
s
exterminator
has
never
appeared
in
poppy
s
chambers
to
perform
considered
a
full
step
i
half
the
step
he
the
other
half
my
efforts
can
not
be
completed
in
full
according
to
my
contract
i
am
to
escort
the
exterminator
through
the
corridors
into
the
bathrooms
and
through
poppy
s
living
quarters
every
third
thursday
of
the
month
at
exactly
p
m
i
am
to
wait
in
one
of
the
three
corridors
leading
to
poppy
s
chambers
i
am
to
wait
until
either
poppy
calls
for
me
or
until
i
am
supposed
to
be
somewhere
else
not
once
has
the
exterminator
shown
up
and
not
once
have
i
heard
of
an
investigation
into
the
exterminator
i
do
not
understand
why
there
has
nt
been
any
investigation
especially
since
poppy
has
seen
on
more
than
several
occasions
a
small
beetle
crawling
in
and
out
of
the
various
ravines
of
his
chambers
landscape
when
i
tell
poppy
that
the
exterminator
has
been
neglecting
his
duties
he
tells
me
about
the
communist
diaspora
and
the
nature
of
the
mongol
hordes
of
the
thirteenth
century
khan
led
on
a
fortress
in
bukhara
in
the
region
of
central
asia
he
will
condemn
the
mongols
in
both
the
chinese
and
russian
governments
blame
them
for
these
regimes
obstinacy
throughout
the
centuries
when
he
is
through
with
his
discourse
i
ask
him
what
should
be
done
he
says
he
does
nt
want
me
to
do
anything
in
fact
he
warns
me
that
i
am
not
to
speak
about
such
things
until
he
himself
sees
the
insect
with
his
own
eyes
and
when
this
occurs
i
am
not
supposed
to
contact
the
exterminator
but
rather
am
expected
to
chase
after
the
bug
capture
it
and
send
it
down
the
incinerator
but
every
time
he
has
seen
this
beetle
i
have
nt
i
tell
him
so
regardless
i
am
sent
off
to
attack
this
invisible
creature
dig
for
it
with
my
fingers
through
the
refuse
of
headlines
and
history
tear
away
words
upon
his
commands
i
destroy
the
mountain
range
as
i
know
it
rearrange
it
the
land
of
all
its
precious
qualities
he
points
me
in
this
direction
and
that
direction
until
he
tires
from
the
chase
and
i
m
left
panting
and
sweating
and
have
newsprint
and
paper
cuts
covering
my
hands
i
discovered
early
on
that
poppy
is
deathly
afraid
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
another
s
blood
which
i
find
confusing
because
he
is
so
exacting
when
describing
the
details
of
medieval
weaponry
and
how
with
the
proper
amount
of
brute
force
a
thick
and
heavy
sword
cuts
through
skin
and
crushes
bone
whereupon
a
man
is
a
pulsing
corpse
on
the
several
occasions
i
have
bled
in
his
presence
he
has
informed
celia
lonesome
head
of
domestic
staff
to
send
a
cleaning
crew
to
disinfect
his
chambers
during
this
time
he
remains
in
bed
as
the
workmen
clean
around
him
spraying
heavy
doses
of
ammonia
onto
the
newspapers
and
into
the
air
dressed
in
smocks
masks
and
rubber
gloves
the
crew
disinfects
and
scours
until
they
have
depleted
most
of
the
chambers
calms
him
of
his
terror
and
mind
you
his
terror
is
quite
real
i
have
learned
that
he
has
many
fears
like
this
and
if
one
wished
to
torment
him
it
would
be
a
very
simple
first
grandchild
and
old
enough
to
be
my
father
my
grandfather
took
me
to
meet
him
at
the
dock
in
port
of
spain
the
ship
that
brought
him
hull
painted
in
big
bold
black
letters
was
the
name
of
our
recently
crowned
queen
queen
elizabeth
ii
at
the
time
i
shared
the
awe
my
teachers
had
for
her
the
sun
never
sets
on
british
soil
this
young
queen
had
the
responsibility
for
us
all
and
the
arrival
of
a
ship
named
after
her
was
an
occasion
for
much
pomp
and
circumstance
hundreds
of
people
thronged
the
dock
that
day
pressing
against
the
wooden
barriers
that
separated
them
from
the
ship
s
passengers
the
police
brass
hand
comic
to
me
then
as
it
was
now
played
military
marches
in
praise
of
our
queen
the
musicians
looked
like
costumed
players
at
carnival
chocolate
faces
melting
under
stiff
white
cardboard
helmets
white
plumes
fanning
on
top
of
brass
spikes
brass
buttoned
white
jackets
heavy
navy
pants
black
leather
shoes
crimping
flat
feet
but
they
were
not
players
at
carnival
the
uniforms
they
wore
paid
homage
to
the
queen
and
to
a
system
of
government
of
which
we
were
proud
down
the
steps
from
the
hands
of
the
ship
s
crew
on
the
top
deck
to
the
left
of
the
ship
s
steps
i
saw
my
cousin
standing
defiantly
alone
his
legs
firmly
planted
apart
in
one
hand
a
spear
and
in
the
other
an
underwater
spear
gun
he
reminded
me
of
an
african
warrior
though
the
only
ones
i
had
seen
at
my
age
then
were
in
my
schoolbooks
and
they
wore
grass
skirts
and
carried
no
guns
of
any
kind
long
after
my
memories
of
the
excitement
on
the
dock
that
day
dimmed
the
image
of
the
spear
and
gun
remained
with
me
as
clear
as
the
sparkling
waters
that
cascaded
over
the
rocks
in
blue
basin
for
my
cousin
who
had
caused
jaws
to
drop
in
disbelief
when
with
the
accuracy
of
a
seagull
plunging
its
beak
into
a
darting
fish
he
dove
from
the
highest
rock
into
that
tiny
pond
we
called
blue
basin
let
that
spear
and
gun
distract
him
under
the
water
in
maracas
bay
when
he
floated
to
the
surface
again
blood
was
pouring
from
night
the
kind
of
bottomless
yawning
grief
that
can
find
nothing
upon
which
to
anchor
itself
that
stretches
itself
out
into
a
long
howl
ending
in
a
hollow
silence
i
heard
men
cry
that
night
my
father
his
five
brothers
my
grandfather
my
cousin
s
friend
his
two
brothers
the
sounds
they
made
were
different
from
the
muffled
sniffles
of
the
women
the
men
bellowed
loudly
in
impotent
rage
lashing
out
at
a
young
man
who
so
missed
his
warm
tropical
sea
on
that
damp
cold
island
we
called
the
mother
country
that
one
night
was
all
he
could
wait
before
he
took
his
spear
gun
with
him
and
dove
deep
deep
into
the
sky
blue
water
they
found
no
water
in
his
lungs
only
blood
streaming
down
his
face
from
veins
in
his
head
that
had
ruptured
under
the
pressure
of
the
sea
still
his
fingers
were
locked
around
his
spear
gun
his
knuckles
turned
grisly
white
he
must
have
thought
he
was
a
fish
the
damn
who
the
hell
would
dive
down
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
with
no
oxygen
who
the
hell
did
he
think
he
was
a
damn
fish
the
blue
basin
champion
blue
basin
s
no
sea
dammit
the
fool
my
uncle
railed
against
my
cousin
s
folly
his
pride
his
ignorance
his
bullheadedness
he
hurled
blame
at
his
dead
son
until
he
exhausted
himself
and
only
grief
remained
releasing
tears
that
poured
without
restraint
down
his
cheeks
my
grandmother
remained
in
stony
silence
not
a
word
of
consolation
not
a
tear
in
sympathy
finally
my
youngest
uncle
melvyn
gathered
up
the
courage
to
explain
he
was
with
my
cousin
when
he
died
we
had
a
warning
he
began
cautiously
i
told
him
so
i
told
him
what
warning
my
grandmother
s
voice
soft
but
firm
stopped
melvyn
in
midsentence
go
on
tell
me
talk
a
big
black
fish
like
a
giant
boat
was
out
at
sea
i
saw
it
break
through
the
water
it
looked
my
uncle
melvyn
paused
go
on
my
grandmother
urged
him
gently
like
a
woman
maybe
it
was
his
words
alone
that
stoked
his
brother
s
fading
anger
or
the
way
he
mumbled
them
under
his
breath
as
though
ashamed
for
thinking
them
begging
some
retribution
that
would
have
proven
his
thoughts
wrong
but
they
revived
my
uncle
and
he
flew
into
a
rage
again
stop
it
stop
it
not
your
goddamn
stories
and
lies
but
my
grandmother
did
not
stop
like
a
woman
she
repeated
dreamily
melvyn
s
eyes
darted
nervously
from
her
to
his
brother
with
arms
like
a
woman
she
asked
short
stunted
but
like
a
woman
my
dead
cousin
s
father
stared
at
my
grandmother
in
disbelief
his
lower
lip
shaking
but
he
did
not
dare
cross
her
he
unleashed
his
fury
on
melvyn
instead
you
stupid
fool
this
is
what
you
have
to
say
when
my
son
is
dead
the
orehu
said
my
grandmother
my
dead
cousin
s
father
held
his
tongue
and
let
her
speak
the
mermaid
the
orehu
she
called
your
son
home
later
when
he
chose
to
forget
that
his
brother
had
said
he
saw
a
fish
like
a
woman
in
the
sea
and
that
his
mother
had
named
it
orehu
and
claimed
it
had
called
his
son
home
my
uncle
asked
melvyn
to
tell
his
story
again
he
would
listen
to
his
tale
about
a
big
fish
like
a
dolphin
alan
had
laughed
at
him
melvyn
said
when
he
told
him
he
had
seen
a
big
black
fish
with
fins
like
arms
rise
vertically
from
the
sea
i
laughed
at
myself
too
no
fish
has
arms
my
uncle
was
satisfied
not
like
a
woman
he
was
reassured
then
what
happened
he
asked
st
paul
thursday
evening
it
was
a
raw
gusty
november
night
the
last
time
jeffrey
chapel
walked
up
the
broad
sweep
of
steps
to
the
st
paul
cathedral
entering
through
the
side
door
he
passed
into
the
vestibule
the
two
appointments
that
awaited
him
in
minneapolis
weighed
heavily
on
his
mind
to
stay
focused
to
bolster
his
flagging
courage
he
needed
a
few
minutes
of
quiet
reflection
and
that
s
why
he
d
come
the
cathedral
had
become
a
refuge
of
late
a
place
of
retreat
when
he
needed
time
alone
jeffrey
had
never
been
much
of
a
churchgoer
before
his
mother
died
she
d
written
to
him
calling
him
a
lukewarm
catholic
a
mighty
condemnation
coming
from
her
pious
lips
during
his
many
years
in
the
military
he
d
never
attended
church
regularly
he
had
nt
been
to
confession
in
years
and
yet
with
all
the
chaos
surrounding
him
now
he
d
found
a
kind
of
peace
within
the
walls
of
this
magnificent
nothing
it
was
the
atmosphere
inside
the
sanctuary
that
affected
him
so
deeply
perhaps
he
reasoned
it
was
a
holdover
from
his
childhood
a
time
when
the
catholic
god
he
d
been
taught
about
was
safely
on
his
throne
and
his
own
life
made
sense
black
and
white
creeds
were
made
for
children
the
curse
of
adult
life
was
to
see
those
clear
cut
blacks
and
whites
dissolve
into
millions
of
shades
of
gray
jeffrey
realized
that
most
of
the
people
in
this
building
believed
passionately
in
their
image
of
god
and
though
he
found
their
certainty
bewildering
the
feel
of
the
place
still
appealed
to
him
especially
since
his
own
life
had
suffered
terribly
from
a
lack
of
personal
conviction
none
of
this
would
have
been
enough
to
placate
his
mother
of
course
but
in
a
strange
way
jeffrey
needed
to
be
here
he
needed
the
tiny
flickering
candles
the
hushed
voices
echoing
through
the
cavernous
interior
the
scent
of
polished
wood
and
the
perfume
of
incense
but
most
importantly
he
quiet
that
got
inside
his
soul
and
stayed
there
he
hoped
to
find
strength
here
tonight
because
for
what
he
had
to
do
he
d
need
every
ounce
of
strength
he
could
muster
entering
the
nave
through
one
of
the
rear
doors
he
saw
that
a
few
parishioners
were
still
sitting
in
the
pews
perhaps
leftovers
from
the
early
evening
mass
directly
to
his
left
was
an
alcove
that
held
mary
s
shrine
breathing
in
the
serene
atmosphere
he
walked
up
to
the
votive
candles
and
lit
one
saying
a
silent
prayer
then
kneeling
before
the
statue
he
gazed
up
into
mary
s
youthful
face
true
to
form
the
artist
had
created
a
child
not
a
womana
sweet
girl
who
could
accept
simple
answers
without
question
jeffrey
would
have
felt
more
secure
confiding
in
a
face
that
looked
as
if
it
had
lived
a
little
one
where
innocence
had
been
worn
away
by
the
hard
realities
of
life
and
yet
he
d
come
here
tonight
for
help
he
might
as
folded
his
hands
and
pressed
them
to
his
forehead
he
quickly
became
so
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
that
he
did
nt
hear
the
footsteps
behind
him
until
a
soft
voice
called
colonel
chapel
jeffrey
turned
to
find
a
short
portly
man
with
a
neatly
clipped
gray
beard
leaning
over
him
it
was
father
latimer
one
of
the
priests
i
m
sorry
to
interrupt
you
said
the
priest
apologetically
but
i
have
nt
seen
you
here
in
weeks
i
ve
been
concerned
i
m
leaving
in
a
few
minutes
and
i
was
hoping
we
might
talk
jeffrey
did
nt
feel
like
having
a
conversation
just
then
but
since
he
owed
this
particular
priest
a
great
deal
he
got
up
and
followed
him
to
one
of
the
back
pews
he
d
been
planning
to
call
father
latimer
to
thank
him
for
the
information
he
d
passed
along
almost
two
months
ago
but
with
everything
in
his
life
caving
in
around
him
he
d
put
it
off
did
you
see
her
was
she
able
to
help
jeffrey
looked
down
at
the
wedding
band
on
his
left
hand
father
latimer
had
officiated
at
his
marriage
five
years
ago
yes
he
said
pressing
his
lips
together
and
looking
up
at
the
altar
i
saw
her
and
it
s
not
good
news
the
priest
gave
a
deep
sigh
sitting
back
in
the
pew
i
was
afraid
of
that
listen
father
i
ve
done
a
lot
of
thinking
in
the
past
month
i
m
going
to
ask
my
wife
for
a
divorce
tonight
she
deserves
much
better
than
me
the
priest
looked
shocked
should
nt
she
be
the
judge
of
that
no
and
i
want
to
take
it
a
step
further
once
the
divorce
is
final
i
want
the
church
to
grant
us
an
annulment
brenna
must
be
able
to
marry
again
as
much
as
he
needed
to
protect
knew
he
could
nt
the
best
he
could
do
was
cut
her
loosegive
her
a
second
chanceand
hope
like
hell
that
one
day
she
could
forgive
him
but
the
sacrament
was
celebrated
you
took
vows
it
s
not
as
simple
as
you
might
think
colonel
please
i
m
retired
from
the
military
you
promised
to
call
me
jeffrey
yes
right
but
you
you
consummated
the
marriage
yes
you
ve
slept
together
of
course
that
s
not
an
issue
but
it
is
i
mean
latimer
paused
then
looked
off
into
space
jeffrey
felt
a
moment
of
intense
guilt
for
the
pathetic
lies
he
d
told
the
man
during
their
last
meeting
at
the
time
he
had
seen
no
other
way
returning
his
attention
to
jeffrey
the
priest
seemed
very
sad
god
loves
you
my
son
if
you
want
to
talk
further
thanksbut
no
thanks
you
say
you
re
she
does
nt
know
she
knows
something
s
been
wrong
for
a
long
time
she
just
does
nt
know
what
and
your
father
in
law
he
s
part
of
the
problem
i
see
he
never
mind
she
was
part
of
some
other
world
a
world
she
no
longer
liked
and
now
she
was
somewhere
else
another
world
she
no
longer
liked
but
she
was
willing
willing
to
give
it
a
whirl
once
in
a
while
children
about
having
children
about
turning
kith
to
kin
how
did
he
feel
about
all
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
were
ever
going
to
have
a
life
of
children
and
lawn
mowers
and
grass
clippings
it
would
be
best
to
have
it
with
someone
who
was
not
demeaned
or
trivialized
by
discussions
of
them
did
he
like
those
big
fertilized
lawns
how
about
a
nice
rock
garden
how
did
he
feel
deep
down
about
those
combination
storm
windows
with
the
built
in
screens
yeah
i
like
them
all
right
he
said
and
she
would
nod
slyly
and
drink
a
little
too
much
she
would
try
then
not
to
think
too
strenuously
about
her
whole
life
she
would
try
to
live
life
one
day
at
a
time
like
an
alcoholic
drink
do
nt
drink
drink
perhaps
she
should
take
drugs
i
always
thought
someday
i
would
have
a
little
girl
and
name
her
after
my
grandmother
sidra
sighed
peered
wistfully
into
her
sherry
what
his
paisley
mouth
grandma
her
name
was
grandma
walter
laughed
in
a
honking
sort
of
way
oh
thank
you
murmured
sidra
thank
you
for
laughing
walter
had
a
subscription
to
autoweek
he
flipped
through
it
in
bed
he
also
liked
to
read
repair
manuals
for
new
cars
particularly
the
toyotas
he
knew
a
lot
about
control
panels
light
up
panels
side
panels
you
re
so
obviously
wrong
for
each
other
said
charlotte
over
tapas
at
a
tapas
bar
hey
please
said
sidra
i
think
my
taste
s
a
little
subtler
than
that
the
thing
with
tapas
bars
was
that
you
just
kept
stuffing
things
into
your
mouth
obviously
wrong
is
just
the
beginning
that
s
where
i
always
begin
at
obviously
wrong
in
theory
she
liked
the
idea
of
mismatched
couples
the
wrangling
and
retangling
like
a
comedy
by
shakespeare
i
ca
nt
imagine
you
with
someone
like
had
met
him
only
once
but
she
had
heard
of
him
from
a
girlfriend
of
hers
he
had
slept
around
she
d
said
into
the
pudding
is
how
she
phrased
it
and
there
were
some
boring
stories
just
do
nt
let
him
humiliate
you
do
nt
mistake
a
lack
of
sophistication
for
sweetness
she
added
i
m
supposed
to
wait
around
for
someone
special
while
every
other
girl
in
this
town
gets
to
have
a
life
i
do
nt
know
sidra
it
was
true
men
could
be
with
whomever
they
pleased
but
women
had
to
date
better
kinder
richer
and
bright
bright
bright
or
else
people
got
embarrassed
it
suggested
sexual
things
i
m
a
very
average
person
she
said
desperately
somehow
detecting
that
charlotte
already
knew
that
knew
the
deep
dark
wildly
obvious
secret
of
that
and
how
it
made
sidra
slightly
pathetic
unseemly
inferior
when
you
got
right
down
caught
in
the
stare
of
a
deer
guns
do
nt
kill
people
thought
sidra
fizzily
deer
kill
people
maybe
it
s
that
we
all
used
to
envy
you
so
much
charlotte
said
a
little
bitterly
you
were
so
talented
you
got
all
the
lead
parts
in
the
plays
you
were
everyone
s
dream
of
what
they
wanted
sidra
poked
around
at
the
appetizer
in
front
of
her
gardening
it
like
a
patch
of
land
she
was
unequal
to
anyone
s
wistfulness
she
had
made
too
little
of
her
life
its
loneliness
shamed
her
like
a
crime
envy
said
sidra
that
s
a
lot
like
hate
is
nt
it
but
charlotte
did
nt
say
anything
probably
she
wanted
sidra
to
change
the
subject
sidra
stuffed
her
mouth
full
of
feta
cheese
and
onions
and
looked
up
well
all
i
can
say
is
i
m
glad
to
be
back
a
piece
of
feta
dropped
from
her
lips
know
what
you
mean
she
said
she
opened
her
mouth
wide
and
let
all
the
food
inside
fall
out
onto
the
table
charlotte
could
be
funny
like
that
sidra
had
forgotten
that
about
her
walter
had
found
some
of
her
old
movies
in
the
video
rental
place
she
had
a
key
she
went
over
one
night
and
discovered
him
asleep
in
front
of
recluse
with
roommate
it
was
about
a
woman
named
rose
who
rarely
went
out
because
when
she
did
she
was
afraid
of
people
they
seemed
like
alien
life
forms
soulless
joyless
speaking
asyntactically
rose
quickly
became
loosened
from
reality
walter
had
it
freeze
framed
at
the
funny
part
where
rose
phones
the
psych
ward
to
have
them
come
take
her
away
but
they
refuse
she
lay
down
next
to
him
and
tried
to
sleep
too
but
began
to
cry
a
little
he
stirred
what
s
wrong
he
asked
nothing
you
fell
asleep
watching
me
i
was
tired
let
me
kiss
you
let
me
find
your
panels
his
eyes
were
closed
she
could
be
anybody
did
you
like
the
beginning
part
of
the
movie
this
need
in
her
was
new
frightening
it
made
her
hair
curl
when
had
she
ever
needed
so
much
it
was
okay
he
said
so
what
is
this
guy
a
race
car
driver
asked
tommy
no
he
s
a
mechanic
ugh
quit
him
like
a
music
lesson
like
a
music
lesson
what
is
this
similes
from
the
middle
class
one
man
s
opinion
she
was
irritated
sidra
this
is
not
right
you
need
to
go
out
with
someone
really
smart
for
a
change
i
ve
been
out
with
smart
i
ve
been
out
with
someone
who
had
two
ph
d
s
we
spent
all
of
our
time
in
bed
with
the
light
on
proofreading
his
vita
ever
done
every
little
little
little
i
mean
have
you
ever
seen
a
vita
tommy
sighed
too
he
had
heard
this
story
of
sidra
s
before
yes
he
said
i
thought
patti
lupone
was
great
besides
she
believing
in
evil
is
that
a
sin
you
know
what
your
mother
would
say
but
justice
needs
to
be
fair
handed
the
dead
deserve
your
compassion
it
s
your
job
to
understand
to
forgive
not
simply
your
custom
you
kneel
beside
bitsi
so
you
re
face
to
face
now

after

behind

in

bright
sky
the
church
bell

noon
the
sound
flat
and
weak
in
the
heat
not
a
swallow
of
air
just
the
shrill
of
hidden
cicadas
grasshoppers
popping
up
a
single
cloud
sails
on
the
horizon
as
if

the

but
only
marta

he
grins
blankly
you

obliged
and
bitsi
leads
you
past
them
old
meyer
s
behind
the
house
scraping
honeycomb
into
a
bowl
his
netting
is
thrown
back
and
a
single
bee
sits
on
one
cheek
like
a
tear
he
points
the
dripping
knife
at
the
treeline
back
there
s
a
young
fella
dead
i
do
nt
know
who
tramp
you
guess
because
it
s
been
a
hard
year
a
lot
of
men
moving
through
looking
for
work
could
be
look
like
he
s
in
the
war
by
his
get
up
that
s
usually
a
clue
a
lot
of
men
never
went
home
six
years
and
they
re
still
pitching
and
striking
camp
marching
at
dawn
what
do
you

old
meyer

pointing
the
knife
you

find
him
meyer
s
right
after
a
minute
of
picking
through
prickers
the
heavy
reek
of
rendered
fat
clamps
around
you
like
smoke
in
a
strange
way
it
s
almost
welcome
after
the
relief
of
the
siege
your
regiment
had
the
job
of
searching
for
casualties
and
this
familiar
smell
in
the
middle
of
a
kentucky
swamp
meant
some
mother
would
get
her
son
back
this
is
nt
so
different
the
man
you
come
across
is
lying
belly
down
beside
the
smudge
of
a
dead
campfire
it
s
gone
all
night
the
stones
cracked
and
blackened
the
cuffs
of
his
private
s
blues
are
frayed
white
the
buttons
missing
he
s
not
green

but
definitely
young
your
age
no
more
than
thirty
and
beardless
you
do
nt
see
any
wounds
his
face
is
so
drawn
the
eyes
so
deeply
sunken
that
for
that
would
take
days
this
looks
quick
one
minute
sitting
on
the
log
the
next
pitching
over
dropped
from
behind
coldcocked
you
think
of
eric
soderholm
and
his
stone
the
dog
in
the
water
you
wonder
if
it
barked
if
the
boys
could
hear
it
over
the
falls
under
a
fern
lies
the
same
tin
cup
that
rattled
at
your
hip
for
three
years
he
s
got
the
same
jacket
the
same
belt
the
same
cap
you
came
home
in
you
squat
and
sniff
the
cup
coffee
straighten
up
and
look
around
for
the
pot
he
boiled
it
in
for
his
stores
one
of
his
pockets
is
sticking
out
like
a
white
flag
and
you
check
the
woods
as
if
the
killer
might
be
watching
you
he
s
long
gone
probably
out
of
the
county
by
now
you
ll
wire
down
the
line
to
shawano
tell
bart
cox
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
tramps
bart
went
to
see
the
elephant
with
you
and
caught
a
minie
healed
crooked
then
went
bad
bart
s
still
a
crack
shot
with
his
other
he
was
a
sergeant
and
has
less
sympathy
than
you
for
these
transients
brother
soldiers
be
damned
but
there
are
a
lot
of
them
out
there
and
your
mother
s
missionary
blood
rises
every
time
you
think
of
them
they
travel
in
twos
often
as
not
sad
really
this
one
probably
thought
the
man
was
his
friend
god
have
mercy
you
pray
then
turn
him
over
no
blood
on
his
filthy
undershirt
no
bullet
holes
no
bowie
knife
slipped
between
the
ribs
his
cuticles
are
purple
like
he
s
dipped
them
in
wine
and
you
wonder
how
long
it
s
been
you
ll
have
to
talk
to
doc
see
what
he
says
you
tuck
the
cap
and
the
cup
into
the
man
s
jacket
cross
his
arms
over
his
belly
though
they
do
nt
want
to
go
this
is
how
they
taught
you
in
the
army
it
s
easier
note
the
sliver
thin
heels
on
his
army
issue
boots
the
cracked
leather
there
s
no
pretty
way
to
do
this
though
you
try
to
be
careful
one
day
when
your
regiment
was
combing
a
meadow
you
broke
a
man
s
jaw
for
propping
a
dead
reb
against
a
fencepost
for
a
joke
if
there
s
anything
your
jobs
have
taught
you
it
s
to
take
death
seriously
the
emperor
paused
to
let
masako
reach
his
side
she
flashed
him
a
grin
a
very
un
japanese
gesture
but
then
she
had
spent
years
in
the
united
states
attending
college
before
their
marriage
he
dearly
enjoyed
seeing
her
grin
and
leaned
forward
so
that
her
lips
brushed
his
cheek
his
smile
broadened
arm
in
arm
they
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
end
then
turned
right
four
men
stood
silently
waiting
they
blocked
the
hallway
the
emperor
stopped
one
of
the
men
moved
noiselessly
to
position
himself
behind
the
royal
couple
but
the
others
did
not
give
way
nor
the
emperor
noted
with
surprise
did
they
bow
not
even
the
tiniest
bob
naruhito
looked
from
face
to
face
not
one
of
the
men
broke
eye
contact
yes
he
said
finally
your
wife
may
leave
your
excellency
said
one
of
the
men
his
voice
was
strong
even
yet
not
loud
who
are
you
asked
the
emperor
i
am
captain
shunko
kato
of
the
japanese
self
defense
force
kato
bowed
deeply
from
the
waist
but
none
of
the
other
men
moved
a
muscle
these
enlisted
men
are
under
my
command
our
own
naruhito
felt
his
wife
s
hand
tighten
on
his
arm
he
looked
again
from
face
to
face
waiting
for
them
to
look
away
as
a
gesture
of
respect
none
of
them
did
why
are
you
here
the
emperor
asked
finally
he
realized
that
time
was
on
his
side
not
theirs
and
he
wished
to
draw
this
out
as
long
as
possible
kato
seemed
to
read
his
thoughts
we
are
here
for
japan
kato
said
crisply
then
added
the
empress
must
leave
now
naruhito
could
read
the
inevitable
in
their
faces
although
the
thought
did
not
occur
to
captain
kato
naruhito
had
as
much
courage
as
any
man
there
he
turned
toward
the
empress
you
must
go
dear
wife
she
stared
into
his
face
panic
stricken
both
her
hands
clutched
his
arm
in
a
fierce
grip
he
leaned
toward
her
and
whispered
we
have
no
choice
go
and
know
i
love
you
the
group
looking
directly
into
the
eyes
of
each
man
three
of
them
averted
their
gaze
then
she
turned
and
walked
back
toward
the
lawn
from
a
decorative
table
nearby
kato
took
a
samurai
sword
which
the
emperor
had
not
previously
noticed
with
one
swift
motion
the
officer
withdrew
the
blade
from
the
sheath
for
japan
he
said
grasping
the
handle
with
both
hands
the
sword
was
very
old
the
emperor
noticed
hundreds
of
years
old
his
heart
was
audibly
pounding
in
his
ears
he
looked
again
at
each
face
they
were
fanatics
resigned
emperor
naruhito
sank
to
his
knees
he
would
not
let
them
see
him
afraid
thank
heavens
his
hands
were
not
trembling
he
closed
his
eyes
and
cleared
his
thoughts
enough
of
these
zealots
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
his
son
and
daughter
the
last
thing
he
heard
was
the
slick
whisper
of
the
blade
whirring
through
the
air
masako
walked
slowly
toward
the
door
where
just
seconds
ago
step
was
torture
agony
the
men
were
assassins
masako
in
her
horror
had
sensed
it
the
moment
she
saw
them
they
had
no
respect
their
faces
registered
extraordinary
tension
not
like
loyal
subjects
meeting
their
emperor
and
his
wife
but
like
assassins
she
knew
her
nation
s
history
of
course
knew
how
assassins
had
plagued
rulers
and
politicians
in
times
of
turmoil
how
they
always
murdered
for
japan
as
if
their
passionate
patriotism
could
excuse
the
blood
could
excuse
slashing
the
life
from
men
who
had
little
or
no
control
over
the
events
that
fired
the
murderers
then
atoned
for
their
crimes
in
orgies
of
ritual
suicide
the
bloody
melodrama
was
terrible
theater
yet
most
japanese
loved
it
reveled
in
it
were
inspired
by
it
ancient
racial
memories
were
renewed
with
flowing
fresh
red
blood
new
sacrifices
propitiated
savage
urges
and
mesmerized
the
audience
patriotic
murder
was
sadistic
masako
thought
an
obscene
perversion
that
surfaced
when
the
world
pressed
relentlessly
in
upon
the
japanese
as
it
had
in
the
s
apparently
was
now
she
could
scarcely
place
one
foot
in
front
of
another
oh
naruhito
beloved
husband
that
we
should
have
to
face
this
and
i
should
not
be
at
your
side
she
turned
and
hurried
back
toward
her
husband
toward
the
evil
that
awaited
them
both
she
ran
the
length
of
her
stride
constrained
by
her
skirt
just
before
she
reached
the
corner
she
heard
the
singing
of
the
sword
and
then
the
sickening
thunk
as
it
bit
into
flesh
she
turned
the
corner
in
time
to
see
her
husband
s
head
rolling
along
the
floor
and
his
upright
torso
toppling
forward
she
saw
no
more
despite
her
pain
or
perhaps
because
of
it
she
passed
out
collapsed
in
a
heap
shunko
kato
did
not
look
again
at
the
emperor
s
corpse
there
was
little
time
and
staring
at
the
body
of
a
man
who
had
failed
japan
would
be
wasting
it
he
arranged
a
letter
on
the
table
where
the
sword
had
rested
the
letter
was
written
in
blood
had
all
signed
it
for
japan
kato
knelt
and
drew
his
knife
he
looked
at
his
chief
nco
who
was
standing
beside
him
his
pistol
in
his
hand
banzai
he
said
banzai
kato
stabbed
the
knife
to
the
hilt
in
his
own
stomach
the
sergeant
raised
his
pistol
and
shot
kato
in
the
back
of
the
head
blood
and
brains
flew
from
the
captain
s
head
the
sound
of
the
shot
made
a
stupendous
thunderclap
in
the
hallway
in
the
silence
that
followed
he
could
hear
the
tinny
sound
of
the
spent
cartridge
skittering
across
the
floor
air
escaping
from
the
captain
s
body
made
an
audible
sound
but
the
sergeant
was
paying
no
attention
he
looked
at
his
comrades
they
too
had
their
pistols
out
brave
men
doing
what
had
to
be
done
the
sergeant
took
a
deep
breath
then
raised
the
barrel
of
his
pistol
to
his
own
head
the
others
did
genre
was
the
infamous
eleanor
of
aquitaine
eleanor
was
related
to
five
count
em
different
kings
or
pseudo
kings
during
the
twelfth
century
her
father
was
the
duke
of
aquitaine
now
known
as
gascony
and
since
he
controlled
more
land
than
the
king
of
france
he
routinely
signed
official
documents
as
the
king
of
aquitaine
in
louis
of
france
arranged
a
marriage
between
his
son
prince
louis
and
princess
eleanor
eleanor
was
nt
a
good
wife
since
she
had
what
s
politely
known
as
a
roving
eye
evidently
it
was
more
than
her
eye
that
roved
her
husband
who
soon
became
louis
vii
of
france
was
a
pious
man
and
his
wandering
wife
not
only
failed
to
produce
an
heir
to
his
throne
but
also
became
notorious
as
an
adulteress
he
finally
managed
to
have
their
marriage
annulled
in
and
two
months
later
eleanor
married
henry
plantagenet
duke
of
normandy
who
incidentally
also
happened
to
be
king
henry
was
not
barren
and
she
bore
henry
several
sons
aside
from
that
henry
and
eleanor
did
nt
really
get
along
together
so
he
took
the
easy
way
out
and
locked
her
up
to
keep
her
out
of
his
hair
after
he
died
eleanor
stirred
up
trouble
between
her
sons
richard
the
lionhearted
and
john
the
incompetent
both
of
whom
became
kings
of
england
they
also
locked
mother
away
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
thus
eleanor
spent
a
lot
of
her
time
locked
up
embroidery
did
nt
thrill
her
too
much
so
she
read
books
books
were
very
expensive
in
the
twelfth
century
because
they
had
to
be
copied
by
hand
but
eleanor
did
nt
care
she
had
money
if
not
freedom
so
she
could
afford
to
pay
assorted
indigents
with
literary
pretensions
to
write
the
kind
of
books
she
liked
given
eleanor
s
background
it
s
understandable
that
she
liked
books
about
kings
knights
in
shining
armor
pretty
young
fellows
who
played
the
lute
and
sang
of
love
towers
her
literary
tastes
gave
rise
to
troubadour
poetry
the
courtly
love
tradition
and
whole
libraries
of
interminable
french
romances
that
concentrated
heavily
on
the
matter
of
britain
king
arthur
et
al
and
the
matter
of
france
charlemagne
and
co
now
we
jump
forward
three
hundred
years
to
the
wars
of
the
roses
there
was
a
certain
knight
named
sir
thomas
malory
probably
from
warwickshire
who
sided
with
the
lancastrians
when
the
yorkist
faction
gained
the
ascendancy
sir
thomas
was
clapped
into
prison
he
was
not
strictly
speaking
a
political
prisoner
however
he
was
in
prison
because
he
belonged
there
since
it
appears
that
he
was
a
career
criminal
more
than
a
political
partisan
there
may
have
been
some
politics
involved
in
the
various
charges
leveled
against
him
of
course
but
the
preponderance
of
evidence
suggests
that
he
was
a
sort
of
medieval
jesse
james
leading
a
gang
of
outlaws
on
a
rampage
through
southern
england
he
was
imprisoned
for
sedition
cattle
rustling
horse
theft
the
looting
of
monasteries
jail
breaking
and
not
infrequently
of
rape
sir
thomas
seems
to
have
been
a
very
bad
boy
he
was
still
a
nobleman
however
and
a
sometime
member
of
parliament
so
he
was
able
to
persuade
his
jailors
to
let
him
visit
a
nearby
library
under
guard
of
course
sir
thomas
was
quite
proud
of
his
facility
in
the
french
language
and
he
whiled
away
the
hours
of
his
incarceration
translating
the
endless
french
romances
dealing
with
what
else
king
arthur
the
end
result
was
the
work
we
now
know
as
le
morte
d
arthur
a
technological
break
through
along
about
then
ensured
a
wide
distribution
of
malory
s
work
william
caxton
had
a
printing
press
and
he
evidently
grew
tired
of
grinding
out
religious
pamphlets
so
sensing
a
potential
market
he
took
malory
s
manuscript
and
edited
it
in
preparation
for
a
printing
run
i
think
we
underestimate
caxton
s
contribution
to
le
morte
d
arthur
if
we
can
believe
most
scholars
of
disconnected
tales
and
caxton
organized
them
into
a
coherent
whole
giving
us
a
story
with
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
now
we
jump
forward
another
four
hundred
years
queen
victoria
ascended
the
british
throne
at
the
age
of
seventeen
queen
victoria
had
opinions
queen
victoria
did
nt
approve
of
naughty
stuff
queen
victoria
had
a
resident
poet
alfred
lord
tennyson
and
he
cleaned
up
malory
for
his
queen
to
produce
a
work
he
called
idylls
of
the
king
idylls
of
the
king
is
a
fairly
typical
victorian
bowdlerization
that
accepted
the
prevailing
attitude
of
the
time
that
le
morte
d
arthur
was
little
more
than
bold
bawdry
and
open
manslaughter
it
glossed
over
such
picky
little
details
as
the
fact
that
guinevere
was
an
adulteress
that
king
arthur
did
have
an
incestuous
affair
with
his
half
sister
morgan
le
fay
and
other
improprieties
another
hundred
years
slip
by
and
we
come
to
papa
tolkien
who
was
probably
even
prissier
than
queen
victoria
have
you
ever
noticed
that
lady
hobbits
and
female
hobbit
puppies
but
no
girls
the
victorians
maintained
the
public
fiction
that
females
do
nt
exist
below
the
neck
contemporary
fantasists
all
bow
politely
to
lord
tennyson
and
papa
tolkien
then
step
around
them
to
go
back
to
the
original
texts
for
inspiration
and
there
are
a
lot
of
those
texts
we
have
king
arthur
and
his
gang
in
english
we
ve
got
siegfried
and
brunhild
in
german
charlemagne
and
roland
in
french
el
cid
in
spanish
sigurd
the
volsung
in
icelandic
and
assorted
myghtiest
knights
on
lyfe
in
a
half
dozen
other
cultures
without
shame
we
pillage
medieval
romance
for
all
we
re
worth
operating
by
trial
and
error
mostly
we
ve
evolved
a
tacitly
agreed
upon
list
of
the
elements
that
make
for
a
good
fantasy
the
first
decision
the
aspiring
fantasist
must
make
is
theological
king
arthur
and
charlemagne
were
christians
siegfried
and
sigurd
the
volsung
were
pagans
my
personal
view
is
that
pagans
write
better
stories
when
a
writer
is
having
fun
christians
let
to
the
person
offending
me
i
stopped
speaking
to
my
sister
one
time
when
she
took
up
cigarettes
and
another
time
when
she
bleached
her
hair
and
this
time
possibly
with
so
deep
and
vindictive
a
hurt
that
i
would
obstinately
refuse
to
tell
any
of
them
the
cause
for
that
would
be
speaking
my
oldest
friend
in
the
world
marvin
winkler
with
whom
as
an
infant
i
had
often
been
lodged
together
in
a
playpen
was
amazed
not
long
ago
when
i
recalled
the
incident
and
related
my
stunned
reaction
he
was
puzzled
by
my
surprise
for
he
had
been
informed
of
the
relationship
by
his
mother
when
he
was
still
a
child
and
cautioned
against
hurting
my
feelings
by
bringing
it
up
my
sister
too
was
taken
aback
to
read
my
account
of
this
event
in
a
biographical
piece
about
me
for
which
she
had
also
been
interviewed
she
along
with
my
mother
and
my
brother
had
simply
assumed
she
claimed
that
i
d
known
all
along
it
was
not
a
scandal
not
even
a
secret
they
did
nt
talk
about
it
because
there
was
no
need
to
on
the
other
hand
i
know
it
is
true
at
all
to
me
about
my
father
least
of
all
about
an
earlier
marriage
until
out
of
curiosity
as
an
adult
i
began
to
inquire
and
only
once
did
my
mother
talk
to
me
about
him
volunteering
the
information
that
my
father
could
eat
a
whole
chocolate
cake
at
a
single
sitting
as
a
delivery
driver
for
a
wholesale
bakery
firm
cakes
were
easy
for
him
to
obtain
and
that
before
he
went
into
the
hospital
with
a
bleeding
gastric
ulcer
his
stool
was
as
black
as
coal
she
told
me
this
as
an
admonition
against
my
own
appetite
for
i
could
always
eat
as
much
cake
as
was
given
me
and
still
want
more
i
discovered
early
in
life
that
shelled
walnuts
in
a
bowl
of
raisins
make
a
lovely
late
evening
treat
for
uninterrupted
munching
till
bedtime
i
once
overheard
my
mother
recounting
that
when
i
was
a
nursing
infant
she
had
to
tear
me
away
from
the
breast
for
i
would
never
finish
and
i
can
believe
her
different
as
each
of
us
was
from
the
we
did
nt
want
to
talk
about
we
were
and
functioned
as
a
close
family
it
was
not
in
our
nature
to
complain
quarrel
demand
or
gossip
i
remember
a
number
of
tantrums
i
discharged
as
a
juvenile
but
i
believe
that
from
the
time
i
was
an
adolescent
i
had
acquired
the
family
s
stoic
resigned
and
undemanding
nature
and
did
nt
complain
quarrel
or
gossip
either
my
mother
finding
herself
after
six
years
of
marriage
a
widow
with
three
children
two
of
them
not
naturally
her
own
had
brought
us
up
as
the
mother
of
us
all
and
my
brother
and
sister
had
related
to
her
as
such
my
brother
i
learned
had
at
one
time
saved
up
money
enough
to
buy
her
a
better
radio
the
gift
was
poignantly
apt
for
my
mother
loved
melodic
music
puccini
arias
in
particular
and
in
those
days
of
radio
entertainment
amid
the
glorious
profusion
of
comedy
and
variety
shows
there
was
an
other
light
classical
pieces
although
the
period
was
one
of
severe
economic
depression
everybody
sooner
or
later
seemed
able
to
find
employment
by
the
time
i
started
school
my
brother
fourteen
years
older
than
i
was
already
working
at
a
brokerage
in
wall
street
as
a
customer
s
man
a
job
for
which
he
was
to
prove
ill
suited
by
his
modest
manner
and
unaggressive
temperament
and
by
a
disposition
to
be
continually
obliging
to
others
my
sister
after
graduating
from
high
school
and
encountering
a
number
of
startling
rebuffs
at
employment
agencies
would
eventually
find
herself
starting
at
r
h
macy
s
department
store
where
she
would
remain
for
something
like
forty
years
and
i
at
sixteen
after
classes
at
high
school
would
be
cutting
a
dashing
figure
in
a
khaki
quasi
military
uniform
as
a
part
time
messenger
boy
delivering
telegrams
for
western
union
in
office
buildings
in
manhattan
weekdays
on
a
bicycle
weekends
to
residences
in
brooklyn
and
mostly
exulting
in
my
duties
with
a
sense
of
adventure
and
attentive
curiosity
of
a
dressmaker
before
her
marriage
worked
steadily
at
home
at
her
sewing
machine
mending
garments
for
neighbors
and
doing
alterations
for
a
cousin
sadie
pacon
who
owned
a
dress
shop
on
gravesend
neck
road
in
lower
flatbush
nearby
she
also
found
steady
work
at
home
from
laundries
turning
frayed
collars
on
men
s
shirts
so
that
from
the
outside
and
at
the
neck
at
least
the
shirts
looked
almost
good
as
new
some
weekend
nights
mainly
saturdays
my
brother
would
find
extra
income
filling
in
at
a
catering
hall
for
some
banquet
dressing
up
appropriately
for
his
suave
role
in
the
cloakroom
or
as
one
of
the
hall
s
hosts
greeting
and
directing
arriving
guests
neighbors
outside
the
apartment
building
seeing
him
depart
in
a
tuxedo
or
a
natty
double
breasted
summer
sport
jacket
might
remark
that
he
was
off
on
a
heavy
date
but
i
knew
he
was
going
to
work
my
mother
liked
to
read
in
europe
her
family
had
been
bookbinders
from
the
coney
island
public
library
i
would
especially
anna
karenina
with
which
she
had
long
been
familiar
and
thought
dostoyevsky
was
crazy
her
brother
my
uncle
sam
late
in
life
was
employed
repairing
books
for
the
library
of
brandeis
university
where
his
son
harry
stein
a
varsity
player
in
james
madison
high
school
in
brooklyn
and
city
college
in
new
york
was
one
of
the
athletic
coaches
when
my
mother
noticed
an
apple
turning
soft
she
would
briskly
plan
a
noodle
pudding
that
made
use
of
it
rather
than
have
it
go
to
waste
she
took
threadbare
bedsheets
to
her
scissors
and
her
sewing
machine
and
converted
them
into
window
curtains
often
as
her
eyesight
weakened
with
age
i
would
the
labels
had
to
stand
out
you
need
the
stickers
to
be
easy
to
read
at
night
and
by
somebody
crying
on
drugs
or
drunk
the
stickers
i
use
are
just
black
on
white
with
the
black
letters
saying
give
yourself
your
life
just
one
more
chance
call
me
for
help
then
my
phone
number
my
second
choice
was
if
you
re
a
young
sexually
irresponsible
girl
with
a
drinking
problem
get
the
help
you
need
calland
then
my
phone
number
take
my
word
for
it
do
nt
make
this
second
kind
of
sticker
with
this
kind
of
sticker
someone
from
the
police
will
pay
you
a
visit
just
from
your
phone
number
they
can
use
a
reverse
directory
and
put
your
name
on
a
list
as
a
probable
felon
forever
after
that
you
ll
hear
the
little
click
click
click
of
a
wiretap
behind
every
telephone
call
you
ever
make
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
use
calling
to
confess
sins
complain
ask
advice
seek
approval
the
girls
you
meet
are
never
very
far
from
their
worst
case
scenario
a
harem
of
women
will
be
clutching
their
telephones
on
the
brink
and
asking
you
to
call
back
please
call
back
please
call
me
a
sexual
predator
but
when
i
think
of
predators
i
think
of
lions
tigers
big
cats
sharks
this
is
nt
so
much
a
predator
versus
prey
relationship
this
is
nt
a
scavenger
a
vulture
or
a
laughing
hyena
versus
a
carcass
this
is
nt
a
parasite
versus
a
host
we
re
all
miserable
together
it
s
the
opposite
of
a
victimless
crime
what
s
most
important
is
you
need
to
put
the
stickers
in
public
telephones
try
inside
dirty
phone
booths
near
bridges
over
deep
water
put
them
next
to
taverns
where
people
with
no
place
to
go
get
thrown
out
at
closing
time
in
no
time
at
all
you
ll
be
in
business
you
ll
need
one
of
those
inside
somewhere
then
people
will
call
in
crisis
and
hear
you
flush
the
toilet
they
ll
hear
the
roar
of
the
blender
and
know
how
you
could
nt
care
less
these
days
what
i
need
is
one
of
those
cordless
telephone
headsets
a
kind
of
walkman
of
human
misery
live
or
die
sex
or
death
this
way
you
can
make
hands
free
life
and
death
decisions
every
hour
when
people
call
to
talk
about
their
one
terrible
crime
you
give
out
penance
you
sentence
people
you
give
guys
on
the
edge
the
phone
numbers
of
girls
in
the
same
position
the
same
as
most
prayers
the
bulk
of
what
you
hear
is
complaints
and
demands
help
me
hear
me
lead
me
forgive
me
the
phone
is
ringing
again
already
the
thin
little
coating
of
crumbs
on
the
veal
cutlet
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
get
right
and
on
the
phone
is
a
new
girl
crying
i
ask
right
away
if
she
ll
trust
me
i
ask
if
she
ll
of
us
are
just
here
swimming
in
one
place
the
cutlet
looks
dug
out
of
a
cat
box
to
calm
this
girl
down
to
get
her
to
listen
i
tell
her
the
story
about
my
fish
this
is
fish
number
six
hundred
and
forty
one
in
a
lifetime
of
goldfish
my
parents
bought
me
the
first
one
to
teach
me
about
loving
and
caring
for
another
living
breathing
creature
of
god
six
hundred
and
forty
fish
later
the
only
thing
i
know
is
everything
you
love
will
die
the
first
time
you
meet
that
someone
special
you
can
count
on
them
one
day
being
dead
and
in
the
ground
chapter
three
the
night
before
i
left
home
my
big
brother
told
me
everything
he
knew
about
the
outside
world
in
the
outside
world
he
said
women
had
the
power
to
change
the
color
of
their
hair
and
their
eyes
and
their
lips
we
were
on
the
back
porch
in
just
the
light
from
the
kitchen
window
my
brother
adam
was
handfuls
of
it
and
cutting
it
with
a
straight
razor
at
about
the
halfway
point
he
d
pinch
my
chin
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
and
force
me
to
look
at
him
straight
on
his
brown
eyes
darting
back
and
forth
between
each
of
my
sideburns
to
get
my
sideburns
even
he
d
cut
one
then
the
other
then
the
first
over
and
over
until
both
sideburns
were
gone
my
seven
little
brothers
were
sitting
along
the
edges
of
the
porch
watching
the
darkness
for
all
the
evils
adam
described
in
the
outside
world
he
said
people
kept
birds
inside
their
houses
he
d
seen
it
adam
had
been
outside
the
church
district
colony
just
one
time
when
he
and
his
wife
had
to
register
their
marriage
to
make
it
legal
with
the
government
in
the
outside
world
he
said
people
were
visited
in
their
houses
by
spirits
they
called
television
spirits
spoke
to
people
through
what
they
called
the
radio
people
used
what
they
called
a
telephone
because
they
hated
alone
he
went
on
cutting
my
hair
not
for
style
as
much
as
he
was
pruning
it
the
way
he
d
prune
a
tree
around
us
on
the
porch
boards
the
hair
piled
up
not
so
much
cut
as
harvested
in
the
church
district
colony
we
hung
bags
of
cut
hair
in
the
orchard
to
scare
away
deer
adam
told
me
the
rule
about
not
wasting
anything
is
one
of
the
blessings
you
give
up
when
you
leave
the
church
colony
the
hardest
blessing
you
give
up
is
silence
in
the
outside
world
he
told
me
there
was
no
real
silence
not
the
fake
silence
you
get
when
you
plug
your
ears
so
you
hear
nothing
but
your
heart
but
real
out
of
doors
silence
the
week
they
were
married
he
and
biddy
gleason
rode
in
a
bus
from
the
church
district
colony
escorted
by
a
church
elder
the
whole
trip
the
bus
was
loud
inside
the
automobiles
on
the
road
with
them
were
what
if
it
s
a
disaster
sara
asked
as
she
got
into
bed
it
s
not
going
to
be
a
disaster
jared
said
you
re
going
to
be
great
but
what
if
i
m
not
what
if
i
m
just
average
maybe
that
s
what
they
were
trying
to
tell
me
maybe
that
s
the
lesson
there
s
no
lesson
and
you
ve
never
been
average
jared
said
joining
his
wife
under
the
covers
it
s
just
your
first
day
of
work
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
up
and
be
yourself
he
shut
off
the
lamp
on
his
nightstand
and
reached
for
the
nearby
alarm
clock
what
time
do
you
want
to
wake
up
how
about
six
thirty
sara
paused
actually
make
it
six
fifteen
she
paused
again
five
forty
five
just
in
case
the
train
s
running
late
shhhh
take
a
deep
on
his
elbow
it
s
okay
to
be
nervous
but
there
s
no
reason
to
get
nuts
i
m
sorry
i
just
i
know
he
said
taking
her
hand
i
know
what
s
riding
on
this
one
i
remember
what
happened
last
time
i
promise
you
though
you
re
going
to
be
great
you
think
so
absolutely
you
really
think
so
sara
from
this
moment
on
i
m
choosing
to
ignore
you
is
that
a
yes
or
a
no
jared
pulled
one
of
the
pillows
from
behind
his
head
and
held
it
over
sara
s
face
i
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
question
does
that
mean
we
re
done
talking
about
work
sara
asked
her
laughs
muffled
by
the
pillow
yes
we
re
done
talking
about
work
jared
straddled
his
wife
keeping
the
pillow
on
her
face
uh
oh
pull
the
pillow
away
but
she
felt
jared
press
down
even
harder
c
m
on
that
s
not
funny
she
said
it
s
starting
to
hurt
stop
whining
what
she
asked
he
did
nt
respond
i
m
serious
jared
i
ca
nt
breathe
she
felt
him
moving
forward
on
her
chest
her
left
shoulder
was
suddenly
pinned
back
by
his
knee
then
her
right
jared
what
re
you
doing
she
grabbed
his
wrists
and
dug
her
nails
into
his
arm
he
only
pressed
down
harder
jared
get
off
me
get
off
me
her
body
was
convulsing
now
violently
trying
to
knock
him
from
his
perch
as
her
nails
tore
at
his
arms
and
legs
her
lungs
lurched
for
air
but
all
he
did
was
hold
tight
she
wanted
to
stop
fighting
but
she
could
nt
choking
on
her
own
tears
she
called
out
his
name
jolted
awake
sara
shot
up
in
bed
her
face
was
covered
in
sweat
and
the
room
was
silent
jared
was
asleep
next
to
her
just
a
dream
she
told
herself
trying
to
stop
her
heart
from
racing
it
s
okay
but
as
she
put
her
head
back
on
the
pillow
she
could
nt
let
it
go
even
more
than
the
others
this
one
felt
real
her
fears
his
response
even
his
touch
all
so
real
it
was
nt
about
jared
though
she
told
herself
it
was
about
work
to
prove
it
to
herself
she
pressed
her
body
up
against
her
husband
and
wrapped
an
arm
around
his
chest
he
felt
warm
under
the
covers
clearly
it
was
about
work
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
squinted
at
the
clock
on
jared
s
nightstand
two
more
hours
she
realized
only
two
more
hours
here

in
my
whole
life
i

who

the

over
at
the

were
still
waiting
for
their
bagels
yes

she
insisted
when

out
those

erasmus
thought
how

only
two
things
land
and
water
to
someone
who

traveled
their
journey
over
that

and
disappeared
with
consistent
inconsistency
one

be

next
walled

lavinia
unaware
of
this
traced
the
route
backward
and
said
with
satisfaction
it
s
not
so
very
far
you
ll
be
home
before
october
expeditions
have
to
winter
over
we
ve
provisioned
for
a
full
eighteen
months
in
case
we
re
frozen
in
with
erasmus
s
book
and
then
asked
the
question
lavinia
might
have
been
framing
in
her
mind
i
have
nt
understood
this
all
spring
she
said
if
you
take
this
route
which
you
say
concentrates
most
efficiently
on
the
areas
in
which
you
have
some
evidence
of
franklin
s
presence
how
can
you
also
search
for
signs
of
an
open
polar

areas

simultaneously
head

worried
him
for
months
but
he
d
pushed
it
aside
zeke
had
nt
mentioned
his
desire
to
find
an
open
polar
sea
since
the
evening
that
had
launched
them
all
on
this
path
lavinia
s
twenty
sixth
birthday
party
back
in
november
alexandra
had
been
present
that
night
as
well
although
erasmus
had
hardly
noticed
her
he
d
been
full
of
hope
that
lavinia
was
about
to
get
what
she
most
desired
with
greenery
and
lining
the
sills
with
candles
scrubbing
the
dissecting
table
and
shrouding
it
with
crisp
linen
on
which
he
d
spread
biscuits
a
roasted
ham
a
turkey
and
a
salmon
in
aspic
lavinia
had
rejected
her
first
three
suitors
too
dull
she
d
said
too
weak
not
smart
enough
while
her
out
for
zeke
and
somehow
won
him
erasmus
had
been
terrified
for
her
during
her
long
campaign
then
relieved
then
worried
again
his
own
fault
zeke
had
asked
for
her
hand
but
been
vague
about
the
details
and
erasmus
had
failed
to
press
him
his
father
would
have
known
better
he
thought
his
father
would
nt
have
permitted
lavinia
to
bind
herself
for
an
uncertain
length
of
time
the
damage
was
done
but
secretly
erasmus
had
hoped
zeke
might
choose
the
party
to
announce
a
wedding
date
herself
radiant
in
white
silk
trimmed
with
blue
ribbons
she
stood
perfectly
still
when
zeke
just
as
erasmus
had
hoped
silenced
the
room
and
said
i
have
an
announcement
looked
confused
zeke
rested
his
elbow
on
a
case
that
held
a
bird
of
paradise
you
ve
all
heard
the
news
announced
by
john
rae
earlier
this
month
he
said
he
stood
with
his
chin
up
his
chest
out
one
hand
dancing
in
the
air
no
doubt
been
the
fate
of
franklin
s
expedition
and
my
relief
that
some
news
however
fragmentary
and
possibly
incorrect
has
been
obtained
men
the
many
rescue
attempts
the
details
of
what
rae
had
discovered
old
news
to
erasmus
who
d
followed
every
newspaper
article
his
guests
listened
glasses
in
hands
among
them
women
who
would
have
listened
with
equal
interest
had
zeke
been
reciting
the
agricultural
products
of
china
anything
erasmus
imagined
them
thinking
for
this
chance
to
gaze
at
zeke
blamelessly
yet
his
own
sister
was
the
woman
zeke
had
chosen
perhaps
you
also
feel
as
i
do
zeke
added
that
now
that
the
area
has
been
defined
someone
has
to
search
further
for
any
possible
survivors
of
lavinia
s
face
she
looked
as
puzzled
as
he
felt
backing
of
a
number
of
our
leading
merchants
for
another
expedition
our
valiant
dr
kane
has
been
searching
for
franklin
in
the
wrong
area
and
although
we
re
all
worried
about
him
and
although
i
d
be
the
first
was
nt
already
being
organized
something
more
is
needed
i
propose
to
set
forth
this
spring
to
search
more
thoroughly
for
franklin
in
the
areas
below
lancaster
sound
while
i
m
there
i
also
propose
to
study
the
region
and
to
further
investigate
the
possibility
of
an
open
polar
sea
something
like
a
smile
hoping
no
one
would
notice
his
surprise
what
merchants
when
how
did
everyone
know
about
this
but
him
lavinia
even
who
might
have
hidden
her
knowledge
but
she
wore
a
smile
as
forced
as
his
own
zeke
must
have
made
these
arrangements
in
secret
taking
pleasure
in
presenting
his
plan
only
when
it
was
complete
about
where
zeke
might
go
and
how
he
might
get
there
and
what
sort
of
ship
and
crew
he
envisioned
zeke
took
lavinia
s
hands
she
beamed
as
if
his
announcement
were
the
ideal
birthday
present
and
when
a
guest
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
began
to
play
she
and
zeke
led
the
crowd
to
the
floor
his
still
night
air
when
zeke
appeared
with
two
glasses
and
a
bottle
he
had
to
ask
questions
erasmus
thought
fatherly
questions
although
that
role
still
felt
odd
what
this
meant
in
terms
of
the
engagement
whether
zeke
wanted
to
marry
lavinia
before
he
left
or
release
her
perhaps
until
he
returned
the
glasses
and
lit
a
cigar
for
himself
erasmus
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
zeke
said
erasmus
you
must
come
with
me
when
are
you
going
to
get
another
chance
like
this
expeditions
he
d
already
missed
was
this
what
he
d
been
waiting
for
even
elisha
kent
kane
had
spurned
him
sailing
off
with
a
crew
of
philadelphians
younger
but
no
smarter
than
himself
perhaps
zeke
sensed
his
discouragement
and
the
extent
of
his
wounded
vanity
else
as
knowledgeable
about
the
natural
history
of
the
polar
regions
or
as
familiar
with
the
hardships
of
such
a
journey
was
preposterous
my
brother
s
first
serious
girlfriend
was
eight
years
older
twenty
eight
to
his
twenty
her
name
was
julia
cathcart
and
henry
introduced
her
to
us
in
early
june
they
drove
from
manhattan
down
to
our
cottage
in
loveladies
on
the
new
jersey
shore
when
his
little
convertible
his
pet
pulled
into
the
driveway
she
was
behind
the
wheel
my
mother
and
i
were
watching
from
the
kitchen
window
i
said
he
lets
her
drive
his
car
my
brother
and
his
girlfriend
were
dressed
alike
baggy
white
shirts
tucked
into
jeans
except
she
had
a
black
cashmere
sweater
over
her
shoulders
she
had
dark
eyes
high
cheekbones
and
beautiful
skin
pale
with
high
coloring
in
her
cheeks
like
a
child
with
a
fever
her
hair
was
back
in
a
loose
ponytail
tied
with
a
piece
of
lace
and
she
wore
tiny
pearl
earrings
i
thought
maybe
she
d
look
older
than
henry
but
it
was
henry
who
looked
older
than
henry
standing
grown
a
beard
for
starters
and
had
on
new
wire
rim
sunglasses
that
made
him
appear
more
like
a
bon
vivant
than
a
philosophy
major
between
colleges
his
hair
was
longer
and
not
yet
lightened
by
the
sun
it
was
the
reddish
brown
color
of
an
irish
setter
he
gave
me
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
as
though
he
always
had
then
he
roughed
around
with
our
airedale
atlas
while
his
girlfriend
and
mother
shook
hands
they
were
clasping
fingertips
ladylike
smiling
as
though
they
were
already
fond
of
each
other
and
just
waiting
for
details
to
fill
in
why
julia
turned
to
me
and
said
you
must
be
janie
most
people
call
me
jane
now
i
said
making
myself
sound
even
younger
jane
she
said
possibly
in
the
manner
of
an
adult
trying
to
take
a
child
seriously
henry
unpacked
the
car
and
loaded
himself
up
with
everything
they
d
brought
little
bags
and
big
ones
a
string
tote
and
his
girlfriend
said
do
you
have
the
wine
hank
whoever
hank
was
he
had
it
except
for
bedrooms
and
the
screened
in
porch
our
house
was
just
one
big
all
purpose
room
and
henry
was
giving
her
a
jokey
tour
of
it
this
is
the
living
room
he
said
gesturing
to
the
sofa
he
paused
gestured
to
it
again
and
said
this
is
the
den
out
on
the
porch
she
stretched
her
legs
in
front
of
her
audrey
hepburn
relaxing
after
dance
class
she
wore
navy
espadrilles
i
noticed
that
henry
had
on
penny
loafers
without
socks
and
he
d
inserted
a
subway
token
in
the
slot
where
the
penny
belonged
julia
sipped
her
iced
tea
and
asked
how
loveladies
got
its
name
we
did
nt
know
but
henry
said
it
was
derived
from
the
indian
name
of
the
founder
julia
smiled
and
asked
my
mother
how
long
we
d
been
coming
here
this
is
our
first
year
tennis
and
without
him
present
i
felt
free
to
add
a
subversive
we
used
to
go
to
nantucket
nantucket
is
lovely
julia
said
it
is
lovely
my
mother
conceded
but
went
on
to
cite
drab
points
in
new
jersey
s
favor
based
on
its
proximity
to
our
house
in
philadelphia
in
the
last
of
our
new
jersey
versus
nantucket
debates
i
d
argued
forcefully
i
d
thought
that
camden
was
even
closer
i
d
almost
added
that
the
trash
dump
was
practically
in
walking
distance
but
my
father
had
interrupted
i
could
tell
he
was
angry
but
he
kept
his
voice
even
we
could
go
to
the
shore
all
year
round
he
said
and
that
would
help
us
to
be
a
closer
family
not
so
far
i
said
meaning
to
add
levity
but
my
father
looked
at
me
with
his
eyes
narrowed
like
he
was
nt
sure
i
was
his
daughter
after
all
my
mother
smiled
at
water
i
d
be
able
to
walk
right
out
the
door
and
go
swimming
only
then
did
i
understand
that
they
d
already
chosen
a
house
they
d
put
a
bid
on
it
it
s
on
the
ocean
i
asked
close
she
said
trying
to
maintain
her
enthusiasm
the
bay
i
said
to
myself
it
does
have
a
spectacular
view
of
the
bay
she
said
but
no
our
house
was
on
a
lagoon
a
canal
like
venice
she
d
said
as
though
this
would
mean
something
to
me
now
julia
asked
if
we
swam
in
there
and
my
mother
said
absolutely
i
did
nt
want
to
acid
rain
on
my
mother
s
parade
but
the
lagoon
had
oil
floating
on
the
surface
and
the
bottom
was
sewagey
soft
i
was
surprised
how
long
henry
sat
with
us
on
the
porch
as
my
mother
turned
the
topic
to
summer
touching
upon
such
controversial
best
mosquitoes
pesky
and
tennis
good
exercise
finally
henry
did
get
up
he
went
outside
as
though
on
a
mission
he
might
be
going
to
check
my
crab
traps
or
to
see
if
we
d
brought
the
bikes
he
could
do
whatever
he
wanted
my
father
was
the
same
way
a
houseful
of
guests
and
my
mother
s
duty
was
to
provide
food
drink
fun
and
conversation
while
my
father
s
was
to
nap
or
read
while
mother
hostessed
and
girlfriend
guested
younger
sister
stood
up
when
there
was
a
pause
in
their
nicing
i
made
my
mouth
move
smileward
i
d
love
to
stay
and
talk
but
i
have
to
go
shoot
some
heroin
now
for
dinner
we
had
crabs
i
d
caught
off
the
dock
my
mother
covered
the
table
with
newspaper
and
we
all
got
print
on
our
arms
as
a
surprise
she
served
preseason
silver
queen
little
nuggets
of
mush
my
typewriter
style
usually
he
d
tap
the
cob
at
the
end
of
a
row
and
ding
in
response
to
my
mother
s
questions
julia
told
us
about
her
brother
in
san
francisco
and
sister
in
paris
both
of
whom
would
be
attending
her
mother
s
annual
gala
in
southampton
julia
chose
her
words
carefully
and
join
his
friend
michael
he
called
as
his
brother
was
rushing
out
the
entrance
looked
puzzled
until
ramsey
nodded
to
the
visitors
michael
immediately
ran
to
the
two
men
bowed
to
his
waist
and
blurted
out
may
i
take
your
leave
otis
and
brisbane
gave
their
permission
smiling
as
they
watched
the
child
bolt
outside
the
boy
resembles
you
laird
brisbane
commented
t
is
the
truth
he
s
your
very
image
for
i
well
remember
you
as
a
lad
god
willing
michael
will
also
grow
into
a
fine
warrior
a
leader
of
men
yes
otis
agreed
with
proper
guidance
he
could
become
a
great
leader
yet
i
could
nt
help
but
notice
that
the
child
fears
his
brother
why
is
that
laird
ramsey
was
nt
offended
by
the
question
as
the
old
man
spoke
the
truth
and
was
simply
making
an
observation
i
m
a
stranger
to
the
boy
but
in
time
he
ll
learn
to
trust
me
and
trust
that
you
wo
nt
leave
he
answered
realizing
how
perceptive
the
old
man
was
i
remember
when
your
father
decided
to
marry
again
brisbane
remarked
i
thought
alisdair
was
too
old
and
set
in
his
ways
to
take
another
wife
your
mother
had
been
dead
over
ten
years
but
he
fooled
me
and
he
seemed
very
content
did
you
ever
meet
glynnes
his
second
wife
i
attended
their
wedding
he
said
because
she
was
so
much
younger
than
my
father
he
was
certain
he
would
die
first
and
he
wanted
to
be
sure
she
was
well
provided
for
he
explained
and
he
asked
this
of
you
otis
inquired
smiling
i
am
his
son
ramsey
responded
i
would
do
whatever
he
asked
otis
turned
to
his
friend
laird
sinclair
would
never
turn
his
back
on
anyone
in
need
ramsey
had
wasted
enough
time
talking
about
personal
matters
and
turned
the
discussion
back
to
the
primary
subject
you
not
achieve
this
with
a
simple
alliance
your
soldiers
would
have
to
patrol
our
borders
night
and
day
otis
said
and
in
time
they
would
grow
weary
of
the
duty
but
if
you
owned
the
land
yes
brisbane
eagerly
agreed
if
the
sinclairs
owned
the
land
you
would
protect
it
at
all
cost
we
have
he
suddenly
stopped
for
he
was
so
stunned
by
the
fact
that
ramsey
had
moved
forward
to
pour
wine
into
their
empty
goblets
he
lost
his
train
of
thought
you
are
laird
yet
you
serve
us
as
though
you
are
our
squire
do
you
not
know
the
power
you
hold
ramsey
smiled
over
their
bewilderment
i
know
that
you
are
guests
in
my
tent
he
answered
and
my
elders
it
is
therefore
my
duty
to
see
to
your
comfort
the
men
were
honored
by
his
words
you
have
your
father
s
heart
otis
praised
his
son
the
laird
accepted
the
compliment
with
a
nod
and
then
gently
led
the
men
back
to
the
topic
he
most
wanted
to
discuss
you
were
saying
that
i
would
protect
your
land
at
all
costs
if
i
owned
it
aye
otis
agreed
and
we
have
much
to
offer
in
return
for
this
union
our
land
is
rich
with
resources
our
lakes
are
glutted
with
fat
fish
our
soil
is
rich
for
planting
and
our
hills
are
filled
with
sheep
which
is
why
we
are
being
constantly
attacked
on
all
our
borders
by
the
campbells
and
the
hamiltons
and
the
boswells
they
all
want
our
land
our
water
and
our
women
but
the
rest
of
us
can
go
to
hell
ramsey
did
nt
show
any
outward
reaction
to
the
passionate
speech
he
began
to
pace
about
the
tent
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
with
your
permission
laird
i
would
ask
a
few
questions
gideon
his
commander
gideon
turned
to
otis
how
many
soldiers
do
you
count
among
the
macphersons
nearly
two
hundred
he
answered
but
as
brisbane
explained
they
have
not
been
properly
trained
and
there
are
one
hundred
more
of
an
age
to
begin
training
otis
interjected
you
could
make
them
invincible
laird
he
said
as
invincible
as
laird
brodick
buchanan
s
spartans
aye
it
s
possible
for
they
already
have
the
minds
and
hearts
of
warriors

call
brodick

soldiers
spartans
gideon
asked
smiling
we
do
for
that
is
what
they
are
otis
replied
have
nt
you
heard
the
stories
about
the
spartans
of
times
past
from
your
fathers
and
grandfathers
as
we
have
gideon
nodded
most
of
the
stories
have
been
exaggerated
nay
most
are
true
otis
replied
the
stories
were
written
down
by
the
holy
monks
and
retold
countless
added
with
a
frown
sinfully
proud
but
extremely
brave
it
was
said
they
would
rather
die
by
the
blade
than
lose
an
argument
t
is
my
opinion
they
were
a
stubborn
lot
we
would
nt
want
our
soldiers
to
be
as
ruthless
as
the
buchanan
warriors
brisbane
hastily
interjected
ramsey
laughed
aye
brodick
s
soldiers

his
smile
faded
as
he
added

count
brodick
as
one
of
my
closest
friends

a
brother
to
me
however
i
will
not
take
exception
to
what

pleaded
how

what

the
room
was
dark
except
for
several
dim
blue
lights
the
largest
of
which
flickered
over
a
portrait
of
dr
thorne
with
a
halo
presently
eager
little
moans
were
heard
from
the
cabinet
followed
by
a
high
girlish
voice

the

did
nt
get
organized
quickly
enough
and
missed
the

the
ectoplasm
obligingly
returned
and
waved
again
there
was
a
slight
pause
more
moaning
and
finally
a
deep
bass
voice
thou

asked
for

and
the
same
person
i
want
you
to
get
that
clear
he
told
us
and
he
seemed
to
mean
it
suddenly
a
thin
white
face
with
a
white
goatee
appeared
at
the
opening
staying
long
enough
to
have
its
picture
taken
mr
dunninger
seemed
unimpressed
come

dr

in
a
black
robe
and
a
cold
sweat
give
me
air
trance
that
seemed
genuine
to
us
he
staggered
from
the
cabinet
and
drank
a
coca
cola
dunninger
said
that
he
had
seen
a
face
but
that
he
was
nt
a
bit
mystified
i
can
produce
an
elephant
from
that
cabinet
he
announced
or
three
girls
and
julius
caesar
no

disputed
him
dr

looked
disappointed
when
dunninger
told
him
that
he
would
nt
get
the
money
one
of
the
women
in

back
said
that

for

tries
to
slip
in
literary
antidotes
for
what
she
has
discovered
are
the
three
great
misconceptions
about

lurk
on

making
it
dangerous
to
venture
out

political
graft
is
rampant
in

must
never

a
great
favorite
in

some
of
the

ca
nt
get
used
to
the
idea
of
an
impartial
unpropagandized
library
one
german
lady
discovering
on
the
shelves
a
copy
of
streicher
s
der
sturmer
ran
out
of
the
room
with
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
one
of
the
attendants
caught
up
with
her
and
convinced
her
that
the
public
library
had
nt
gone
nazi
it
turns
out
that
the
american
novelists
who
have
been
most
popular
abroad
are
lewis
dos
passos
dreiser
hemingway
upton
sinclair
and
joseph
hergesheimer
miss
flexner
is
not
convinced
that
this
is
all
for
the
best
whenever
it
is
suggested
to
a
refugee
that
he
might
find
greater
opportunities
outside
of

he
is
likely
to
turn
pale
and
murmur
must
i
go
to
main
street
must
i
live
in
gopher
prairie
the
library
people
try
to
explain
that
main
street
is
the
result
of
a
tantrum
which
sinclair
lewis
got
over
years
ago
but
it
s
uphill
we
want
to
be
when
we
grow
up
is
a
tunneller
in
macy
s
to
explain
what
a
tunneller
does
we
first
have
to
describe
macy
s
conveyor
system
by
which
packages
are
sent
from
the
wrapping
rooms
on
each
floor
to
the
loading
platform
in
the
basement
where
they
are
put
into
the
delivery
tracks
the
conveyors
are
spiral
metal
chutes
about
three
feet
high
and
two
and
a
half
wide
they
go
round
and
round
and
down
or
women
children
and
pot
bellied
men
were
splashing
around
in
the
surf
to
my
right
was
another
hotel
and
then
another
each
with
its
own
crowded
beach
i
took
the
restaurant
was
closed
so
i
tried
the
bar
it
showed
every
sign
of
having
been
flown
down
intact
from
a
catskill
mountain
resort
i
sat
there
for
two
hours
drinking
eating
peanuts
and
staring
out
at
the
ocean
there
were
roughly
a
dozen
people
in
the
place
the
men
looked
like
sick
mexicans
with
thin
little
mustaches
and
silk
suits
that
glistened
like
plastic
most
of
the
women
were
americans
a
brittle
looking
lot
none
of
them
young
all
wearing
sleeveless
cocktail
dresses
that
fit
like
rubber
sacks
i
felt
like
something
that
had
washed
up
on
the
beach
my
wrinkled
cord
coat
was
five
years
old
and
frayed
at
the
neck
my
pants
had
no
creases
and
although
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
to
wear
a
tie
i
was
obviously
out
of
place
without
one
rather
than
seem
like
a
pretender
i
gave
up
on
rum
and
ordered
a
beer
the
bartender
eyed
me
sullenly
and
i
knew
the
reason
why
i
was
wearing
nothing
that
glistened
apple
in
order
to
make
a
go
of
it
here
i
would
have
to
get
some
dazzling
clothes
at
six
thirty
i
left
the
bar
and
walked
outside
it
was
getting
dark
and
the
big
avenida
looked
cool
and
graceful
on
the
other
side
were
homes
that
once
looked
out
on
the
beach
now
they
looked
out
on
hotels
and
most
of
them
had
retreated
behind
tall
hedges
and
walls
that
cut
them
off
from
the
street
here
and
there
i
could
see
a
patio
or
a
screen
porch
where
people
sat
beneath
fans
and
drank
rum
somewhere
up
the
street
i
heard
bells
the
sleepy
tinkling
of
brahms
lullaby
i
walked
a
block
or
so
trying
to
get
the
feel
of
the
place
and
the
bells
kept
coming
closer
soon
an
ice
cream
truck
appeared
moving
slowly
down
the
middle
of
the
street
on
its
roof
was
a
giant
popsicle
flashing
on
and
off
with
red
neon
explosions
that
lit
up
the
whole
area
from
somewhere
in
its
bowels
came
the
clanging
of
mr
driver
grinned
happily
and
blew
his
horn
i
immediately
hailed
a
cab
telling
the
man
to
take
me
to
the
middle
of
town
old
san
juan
is
an
island
connected
to
the
mainland
by
several
causeways
we
crossed
on
the
one
that
comes
in
from
condado
dozens
of
puerto
ricans
stood
along
the
rails
fishing
in
the
shallow
lagoon
and
off
to
my
right
was
a
huge
white
shape
beneath
a
neon
sign
that
said
carib
hilton
this
i
knew
was
the
cornerstone
of
the
boom
conrad
had
come
in
like
jesus
and
all
the
fish
had
followed
before
hilton
there
was
nothing
now
the
sky
was
the
limit
we
passed
a
deserted
stadium
and
soon
we
were
on
a
boulevard
that
ran
along
a
cliff
on
one
side
was
the
dark
atlantic
and
on
the
other
across
the
narrow
city
were
thousands
of
colored
lights
on
cruise
ships
tied
up
at
the
waterfront
we
turned
off
the
boulevard
and
stopped
at
a
place
the
driver
said
was
plaza
coln
two
bills
he
looked
at
the
money
and
shook
his
head
what
s
wrong
i
said
he
shrugged
no
change
seor
i
felt
in
my
pocket
nothing
but
a
nickel
i
knew
he
was
lying
but
i
did
nt
feel
like
taking
the
trouble
to
get
a
dollar
changed
you
goddamn
thief
i
said
tossing
the
bills
in
his
lap
he
shrugged
again
and
drove
off
the
plaza
coln
was
a
hub
for
several
narrow
streets
the
buildings
were
jammed
together
two
and
three
stories
high
with
balconies
that
hung
out
over
the
street
the
air
was
hot
and
a
smell
of
sweat
and
garbage
rode
on
the
faint
breeze
a
chatter
of
music
and
voices
came
from
open
windows
the
sidewalks
were
so
narrow
that
it
was
an
effort
to
stay
out
of
the
gutter
and
fruit
vendors
blocked
the
streets
with
wooden
carts
selling
peeled
oranges
for
a
nickel
each
i
walked
for
thirty
minutes
looking
into
peering
into
foul
bars
full
of
whores
and
sailors
dodging
people
on
the
sidewalks
thinking
i
would
collapse
at
any
moment
if
i
did
nt
find
a
restaurant
finally
i
gave
up
there
seemed
to
be
no
restaurants
in
the
old
city
the
only
thing
i
saw
was
called
the
new
york
diner
and
it
was
closed
in
desperation
i
hailed
a
cab
and
told
him
to
take
me
to
the
daily
news
he
stared
at
me
the
newspaper
i
shouted
slamming
the
door
as
i
got
in
ah
s
he
murmured
el
diario
s
no
goddamnit
i
said
the
daily
news
the
american
newspaper
el
news
he
had
never
heard
of
it
so
we
drove
back
to
plaza
coln
where
i
leaned
out
the
window
and
asked
a
cop
he
did
nt
know
either
but
finally
a
man
came
over
from
the
bus
stop
and
told
us
where
it
was
we
was
no
sign
of
a
newspaper
and
i
suspected
he
was
bringing
me
down
here
to
get
rid
of
me
we
turned
a
corner
and
he
suddenly
hit
his
brakes
just
ahead
of
us
was
some
kind
of
a
gang
fight
a
shouting
mob
trying
to
enter
an
old
greenish
building
that
looked
like
a
warehouse
go
on
i
said
to
the
driver
we
can
get
by
he
mumbled
and
shook
his
head
i
banged
my
fist
on
the
back
of
the
seat
get
going
no
move
no
pay
he
mumbled
again
but
shifted
into
first
and
angled
toward
the
far
side
of
the
street
putting
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
us
and
the
fight
he
stopped
as
we
came
abreast
of
the
building
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
gang
of
about
twenty
puerto
ricans
attacking
a
tall
american
in
a
tan
i
the
air
these
nights
though
it
is
already
november
just
shivers
with
mosquitoes
and
the
stinkbugs
sometimes
late
at
night
it
sounds
like
a
ping
pong
game
those
tough
little
shells
tock
tocking
against
the
screens
what
you
reckon
i
got
in
here
they
could
want
or
need
that
s
anyhow
why
i
did
nt
get
up
right
off
and
run
to
the
door
when
the
tapping
started
figured
the
bugs
was
just
hankering
after
something
again
but
when
the
screen
door
rattled
i
knew
somebody
had
a
mind
to
open
it
you
stay
right
where
you
are
i
said
i
mean
it
leandra
my
name
blew
in
from
the
porch
on
a
breath
of
a
breeze
that
had
cooled
down
to
just
right
for
sleeping
my
heart
knew
right
away
who
it
was
but
the
rest
of
me
somehow
refused
the
knowing
i
set
down
the
scrap
of
doll
s
dress
a
bedragglement
of
loose
lace
hem
got
up
i
kept
one
step
closer
to
the
door
what
business
you
think
you
got
here
i
said
i
was
staring
hard
for
some
reason
at
the
dolls
lined
up
on
the
mourners
bench
its
stern
length
taking
up
the
wall
between
me
and
the
porch
the
dolls
come
in
earlier
that
week
the
afflicted
the
sick
and
the
sorry
waiting
to
be
saved
a
pitiful
sight
the
lot
of
them
mostly
stark
naked
and
some
in
pieces
one
lady
in
a
mildewed
petticoat
was
holding
her
head
in
her
lap
i
m
grown
right
tired
of
trying
to
work
miracles
i
thought
leandra
the
whisper
again
door
rattling
it
s
me
had
better
not
be
was
all
i
could
say
and
my
hands
were
shaking
then
i
heard
the
laugh
knew
it
for
wim
s
and
with
it
like
always
came
the
end
of
any
good
sense
i
ever
had
i
went
and
unlatched
the
screen
but
to
hold
open
the
door
for
a
man
could
only
be
here
because
he
intended
to
ruin
my
life
and
his
april
it
was
when
i
first
went
to
massachusetts
but
it
felt
like
winter
to
me
i
was
twenty
one
years
old
and
had
never
once
been
out
of
north
carolina
except
up
to
norfolk
and
my
mama
gone
but
six
months
it
might
have
calmed
me
down
some
had
branch
been
there
to
carry
me
to
the
airport
but
branch
was
off
at
fort
bragg
that
year
and
not
available
to
be
leaned
on
when
miss
maude
ellen
s
nephew
vern
put
me
on
that
plane
in
norfolk
i
very
nearly
cried
right
out
there
in
public
i
d
never
gone
even
so
far
as
to
picture
myself
on
an
airplane
you
make
it
back
in
one
piece
i
ll
maybe
try
it
myself
one
day
vern
said
i
asked
him
did
he
want
my
ticket
then
and
there
i
ai
nt
in
no
hurry
he
told
me
his
was
ten
years
ago
now
but
i
do
nt
guess
i
ll
ever
get
over
it
where
i
flew
to
was
boston
and
it
still
about
strangles
my
heart
to
recollect
how
close
that
airplane
come
to
landing
on
sheer
water
they
ought
to
build
airports
in
a
place
gives
a
little
more
seam
allowance
is
what
i
think
this
man
was
sitting
next
to
me
wearing
a
brown
suit
and
a
spotty
necktie
i
recall
and
he
patted
my
knee
when
the
plane
bumped
down
and
sighed
with
more
relief
than
i
myself
was
prepared
to
feel
terra
firma
he
said
i
nodded
pleased
i
said
a
few
minutes
later
the
man
helped
me
get
mama
s
vanity
case
down
from
the
curved
bin
above
our
seats
and
i
said
thank
you
kindly
mr
terrafirma
and
i
never
got
the
gist
of
his
giddy
smile
not
at
all
like
a
businessman
until
way
later
when
my
brother
in
law
who
is
wim
or
was
then
terra
firma
is
solid
ground
i
know
that
now
but
it
feels
like
something
i
have
nt
stood
on
since
i
was
a
child
the
yellow
porch
light
i
thought
i
shut
off
hours
before
made
his
olive
skin
look
brassy
it
jaundiced
his
eyes
and
coated
his
teeth
and
tainted
the
streaks
of
white
in
his
wiry
hair
the
only
thing
that
yellow
bulb
did
nt
do
was
keep
the
bugs
away
like
it
was
meant
to
the
chinch
bugs
bounced
off
the
screen
the
mosquitoes
and
moths
congregated
around
his
face
wim
stood
there
in
all
that
mess
and
stared
in
at
me
like
i
could
save
him
just
what
do
you
think
you
re
doing
here
i
d
like
to
know
i
said
he
nodded
like
he
was
agreeing
i
had
every
right
to
ask
he
looked
like
something
the
cat
dragged
in
rode
hard
and
put
away
wet
through
the
mill
to
hell
and
back
were
other
ideas
that
occurred
to
me
but
wim
who
teaches
the
boys
are
rich
and
no
girls
are
allowed
who
once
even
wrote
a
book
of
poems
printed
in
new
york
city
when
he
was
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
himself
and
ca
nt
seem
to
get
over
it
well
wim
is
death
on
what
he
calls
cliches
and
he
s
made
it
hard
for
me
not
to
notice
them
and
it
seems
like
my
mouth
has
never
worked
right
since
if
you
re
disallowed
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
what
in
the
world
are
you
supposed
to
call
it
so
i
just
stood
there
gaping
at
him
my
mouth
like
a
drain
that
was
all
clogged
up
with
these
words
did
nt
have
a
thing
wrong
with
them
except
they
d
been
used
a
bit
like
something
you
d
run
across
at
a
rummage
sale
on
a
lucky
day
another
long
minute
went
by
then
wim
came
to
i
guess
because
he
slapped
at
a
mosquito
on
his
forehead
and
his
hand
came
away
bloody
and
a
red
blossom
bloomed
above
his
eyebrow
if
the
months
of
the
year
were
put
on
parade
in
san
antonio
texas
and
a
popular
vote
taken
april
would
undoubtedly
emerge
as
the
hands
down
favorite
april
brings
both
the
sweetest
weather
and
the
biggest
parties
of
the
year
but
this
april
felt
more
like
june
in
the
steadiness
of
its
heat
and
on
this
particular
april
morning
an
unusual
tension
augmented
the
heat
strangers
in
the
normally
friendly
city
were
less
likely
to
greet
one
another
on
the
street
instead
there
were
wary
sidelong
glances
and
strollers
downtown
walked
to
their
cars
a
little
faster
at
the
center
of
this
uneasiness
stood
the
bexar
county
justice
center
the
criminal
courthouse
on
the
edge
of
downtown
there
the
tension
went
undisguised
protestors
in
front
of
the
building
carried
signs
occasionally
one
shouted
angrily
the
protestors
were
dwarfed
by
the
imposing
five
story
stone
building
but
employees
in
the
building
felt
their
presence
guards
at
the
entrance
of
the
justice
center
watched
the
protestors
with
hands
resting
on
gun
butts
an
odor
it
emanated
from
a
third
floor
courtroom
the
courtroom
could
nt
accommodate
everyone
who
had
wanted
to
watch
the
trial
in
progress
some
of
the
people
who
had
been
turned
away
milled
in
the
hallway
waiting
with
the
television
cameramen
and
sometimes
standing
on
tiptoes
to
try
to
get
a
glimpse
through
the
glass
doors
of
the
court
inside
the
courtroom
spectators
sat
packed
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
judge
and
the
armed
bailiffs
had
shushed
the
crowd
more
than
once
and
no
one
spoke
they
strained
to
hear
the
witnesses
and
the
lawyers
but
the
mere
breathing
of
so
many
people
created
a
low
background
noise
in
the
courtroom
at
the
front
of
the
courtroom
the
district
attorney
of
bexar
county
chris
sinclair
shook
his
head
and
said
no
more
questions
your
honor
seconds
later
the
judge
s
gavel
banged
down
declaring
a
long
lunch
recess
chris
spoke
briefly
to
his
assistant
then
stood
and
turned
toward
the
courtroom
s
exit
he
reached
the
gate
in
the
railing
two
men
looked
at
each
other
an
alert
newspaper
photographer
brought
up
his
camera
and
snapped
a
photo
of
the
two
that
would
soon
become
famous
the
picture
was
brilliant
in
its
contrasts
chris
sinclair
the
fresh
steady
district
attorney
who
looked
too
young
to
have
been
a
trial
lawyer
for
almost
fifteen
years
he
had
been
elected
district
attorney
only
six
months
earlier
a
newspaper
columnist
had
dubbed
the
christian
sinclair
campaign
blond
ambition
and
had
gone
on
to
say
his
name
looks
as
good
on
the
ballot
as
his
face
does
on
billboards
chris
had
come
out
of
nowhere
as
far
as
the
public
was
concerned
when
he
had
announced
his
candidacy
but
he
had
surprised
himself
by
being
a
good
campaigner
thoughtful
and
confidence
inspiring
but
first
as
many
lawyers
in
san
antonio
would
ruefully
acknowledge
he
was
a
damned
good
trial
lawyer
he
had
proven
that
again
in
one
trial
since
his
election
but
this
current
trial
was
very
different
the
prosecution
of
malachi
reese
was
being
much
larger
shadows
across
the
city
major
consequences
waited
to
pounce
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial
the
defendant
stood
close
to
the
district
attorney
at
the
gate
in
the
railing
older
african
american
looking
confidently
but
curiously
into
his
persecutor
s
eyes
and
clearly
many
saw
malachi
reese
as
the
persecuted
as
a
black
man
being
unjustly
attacked
by
a
white
establishment
for
which
christian
sinclair
served
as
the
perfect
poster
boy
after
that
one
frozen
moment
malachi
reese
smiled
cordially
and
held
the
gate
open
chris
went
through
it
and
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
reese
followed
more
slowly
stopping
to
receive
the
encouragement
of
his
supporters
and
to
talk
to
the
many
reporters
malachi
reese
had
not
come
out
of
nowhere
to
be
the
center
of
attention
at
his
own
trial
for
the
average
citizen
of
san
antonio
reese
fulfilled
the
definition
of
local
celebrity
he
was
well
known
for
being
well
known
people
recognized
him
as
having
been
a
part
of
the
fabric
of
public
life
for
some
years
without
being
able
to
community
groups
and
responsible
for
several
successful
political
campaigns
reese
had
never
run
for
office
himself
mostly
he
moved
in
the
background
of
committees
and
conferences
but
when
he
did
step
forward
he
drew
attention
when
he
served
as
a
spokesman
he
exhibited
the
authority
and
confidence
of
a
leader
people
nodded
along
as
he
spoke
even
in
confrontation
he
retained
his
composure
in
the
battlefields
of
emotion
no
one
wielded
logic
more
forcefully
than
malachi
reese
reese
had
brought
those
same
skills
to
his
trial
for
capital
murder
nearing
fifty
years
old
handsome
and
well
groomed
he
looked
distinguished
in
his
dark
gray
suit
the
suit
s
subtle
pattern
seemed
to
compliment
his
dark
brown
skin
old
photos
showed
reese
sporting
an
afro
of
impressive
depth
but
those
days
were
gone
his
black
hair
was
of
a
medium
cut
now
more
curly
than
kinky
and
going
sagely
gray
around
his
ears
his
small
trim
beard
made
him
look
christ
like
an
invisible
spotlight
always
seemed
to
be
picking
him
out
stopped
to
give
a
group
interview
to
the
cluster
of
reporters
wearing
an
expression
of
sad
bafflement
reese
looked
like
a
strong
man
caught
in
a
kafkaesque
puzzle
confronting
lies
so
outrageous
he
could
barely
respond
malachi
reese
s
face
was
his
vocation
even
while
listening
his
face
communicated
his
expression
slid
from
concentration
to
concern
to
observation
one
never
doubted
that
reese
really
heard
the
speaker
he
had
thoughtful
answers
to
every
question
until
the
questions
ceased
and
his
voice
flowed
on
a
river
of
gold
people
listening
to
that
voice
not
only
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
reese
had
committed
a
brutal
double
murder
they
found
it
impossible
even
to
hold
the
accusation
in
their
minds
ludicrous
they
thought
one
reporter
trailed
chris
sinclair
down
the
hall
to
ask
the
question
chris
had
been
asked
repeatedly
and
done
the
only
