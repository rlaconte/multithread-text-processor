would
be
absent
for
some
time
she
also
added
although
the
young
man
had
not
once
thought
of
inquiring
for
miss
lytton
that
laura
lytton
lodge
the
foolish
young
victim
of
the
widow
s
false
wiles
looked
very
much
disappointed
and
depressed
yet
had
sense
enough
left
him
to
remember
to
say
that
as
he
himself
was
on
the
road
to
perch
point
and
should
take
lytton
lodge
on
his
way
he
would
be
happy
to
convey
any
letter
or
message
from
the
ladies
of
blue
cliffs
to
miss
lytton
emma
thanked
him
and
availed
herself
of
his
offer
by
sending
a
letter
as
we
have
seen
and
then
she
went
about
the
house
attended
by
old
moll
selecting
and
arranging
rooms
for
her
new
expected
guests
the
next
afternoon
she
was
quite
surprised
by
another
call
from
craven
kyte
he
was
shown
into
the
parlor
where
she
sat
at
work
with
electra

are
glad
to

she
said
as
she
arose
to
shake
hands
with
him

he
answered
after
bowing
to
her
and
to
electra

early
this

as

passed
by
the
gate
this
morning
the
man
taters
who
was
at
work
on
the
lawn
told
me
that

alden

place

said
the
young
man
stammering
and
blushing
business
of
importance
calls
me
to
to
charlottesville
miss
so
if
you
should
have
a
letter
or
a
message
to
send
to
to
emma
cavendish
and
electra
coroni
looked
at
each
other
in
comic
surprise
why
you
must
be
an
amateur
postman
mr
kyte
to
fetch
and
carry
letters

to
be
your
mission
on

electra

of

miss

the

quite
seriously

emma

anxious

will
do
so
with
much
pleasure
said
mr
kyte
rising
to
take
leave
as
soon
as
the
visitor
had
left
them
the
two
young
ladies
exchanged
glances
of
droll
amazement
as
sure
as
you
live
emma
the
business
of
importance
that
takes
taken
in
and
done
for
poor
wretch
i
should
nt
wonder
a
bit
if
he
sold
out
his
share
in
the
fancy
dry
goods
store
at
wendover
and
invested
all
his
capital
in
college
fees
and
entered
himself
as
a
student
at
the
university
for
the
sake
of
being
near
his
enchantress
said
electra
poor
boy
sighed
emma
with
genuine
pity
and
before
they
could
exchange
another
word
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
at
the
gate
announced
the
arrival
of
alden
and
laura

montgomery
with
pleasure
ran
out
to
meet
her
friends
alden
and
laura
lytton
just
admitted
by
the
footman
stood
within
the
hall
miss
cavendish
welcomed
laura
with
a
kiss
and
alden
with
a
cordial
grasp
of
the
hand
i
am
so
delighted
to
see
you
dear
laura
and
you
also
mr
lytton
she
said
leading
the
way
into
the
parlor
well
as
i
like
my
kind
relatives
at
lytton
lodge
i
am
very
glad
to
get
back
to
you
emma
dear
and
that
is
the
truth
answered
laura
as
she
sank
into
an
arm
chair
and
began
to
draw
off
her
gloves
alden
said
nothing
he
had
bowed
deeply
in
response
to
miss
cavendish
s
words
of
welcome
and
now
he
was
thinking
what
a
bright
and
beautiful
creature
she
was
how
full
of
healthful
joyous
life
she
seemed
and
wondering
that
he
had
never
noticed
all
this
before
but
he
had
noticed
it
before
when
he
first
saw
emma
cavendish
in
her
the
most
heavenly
vision
of
loveliness
that
had
ever
beamed
upon
mortal
eyes
and
he
would
have
continued
to
think
so
had
not
the
baleful
beauty
of
mary
grey
glided
before
him
and
beguiled
his
sight
and
his
soul
but
mary
grey
was
gone
with
all
her
magic
arts
and
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
clearer
and
brighter
for
her
absence
as
soon
as
you
have
rested
a
little
come
up
to
your
room
laura
and
lay
on
your
wraps
tea
will
be
ready
by
the
time
we
come
down
again
and
mrs
lytton
your
old
attendant
jerome
will
show
you
to
your
apartment
said
the
young
hostess
as
she
arose
with
a
smile
to
conduct
her
guest
they
left
the
drawing
room
together
and
while
laura
lytton
was
arranging
her
toilet
in
the
chamber
above
stairs
emma
cavendish
told
her
the
particulars
of
mary
grey
s
departure
and
also
of
the
letter
she
had
received
from
her
long
estranged
relative
mrs
fanning
they
went
down
to
tea
where
miss
cavendish
presented
mr
lytton
to
dr
jones
and
then
they
sat
down
to
the
table
alden
because
he
well
knew
that
somewhere
upon
the
broad
earth
leah
if
living
at
all
sorrow
chapter
xlii
the
first
spring
of
peace
gave
place
to
summer
a
summer
memorable
for
its
intense
heat
one
afternoon
toward
the
latter
part
of
july
clouds
dark
and
angry
overcast
the
sky
and
peals
of
thunder
and
flashes
of
lightning
threatened
a
terrific
storm
pedestrians
hurried
homeward
and
man
and
beast
sought
safety
under
shelter
the
waters
of
the
quiet
harbor
tossed
by
rude
winds
grew
angry
and
rose
in
white
capped
breakers
that
broke
against
the
wharves
piers
and
fortresses
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
sea
gulls
screamed
and
flew
wildly
about
at
this
ominous
appearance
of
the
heavens
while
the
songsters
of
the
woods
and
the
pigeons
of
the
barn
yard
sought
shelter
from
the
approaching
tempest
at
night
fall
the
rain
descended
in
torrents
safely
sheltered
in
his
comfortable
home
mr
mordecai
sat
for
an
hour
or
more
watching
from
his
library
window
the
fury
of
the
storm
the
tall
graceful
cedars
and
olive
trees
that
adorned
the
front
and
wind
which
rudely
snatched
from
their
trellises
the
delicate
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
vines
that
lent
such
delicious
odor
to
the
evening
winds
it
tore
the
flowers
from
their
stems
and
the
rain
pelted
them
into
the
earth
in
its
fury
leaves
were
whisked
from
their
branches
and
blown
out
of
sight
in
a
twinkle
a
weak
hinged
window
shutter
of
the
attic
was
ruthlessly
torn
away
and
pitched
headlong
into
the
street
all
this
mr
mordecai
watched
in
amazement
and
then
as
if
some
sudden
apparition
of
thought
or
of
sight
had
appeared
before
him
he
turned
from
the
window
with
a
shudder
and
said
this
is
a
devilish
wild
night
i
ll
drop
the
curtain
seating
himself
then
by
a
brightly
shining
lamp
the
queen
city
gas
works
had
been
destroyed
by
the
shelling
guns
he
clasped
his
arms
across
his
breast
and
looked
steadily
up
toward
the
ticking
clock
upon
the
mantel
thus
absorbed
in
reverie
he
sat
for
an
hour
and
was
only
disturbed
then
by
a
loud
rapping
at
the
front
door
wild
night
the
rapping
sounded
again
louder
than
before
mingo
he
exclaimed
involuntarily
ah
the
dog
is
free
now
and
only
answers
my
summons
at
his
will
good
boy
though
the
rapping
was
repeated
i
must
go
myself
who
can
be
so
importunate
on
this
dark
wretched
night
no
robber
would
be
so
bold
and
grasping
the
lamp
he
glided
softly
toward
the
front
door
he
turned
the
bolt
cautiously
and
opening
the
door
a
little
peered
out
come
mordecai
open
the
door
said
a
friendly
voice
without
do
you
suspect
thieves
this
foul
night
no
wonder
mr
mordecai
opened
the
door
wider
and
saw
rabbi
abrams
and
a
man
so
disguised
that
he
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
any
one
he
knew
what
do
you
want
my
friend
he
said
kindly
want
you
to
go
with
us
mordecai
replied
the
was
trying
to
tear
away
go
where
asked
mr
mordecai
in
consternation
only
the
devils
themselves
could
stand
such
a
night
as
this
come
be
quiet
my
friend
i
am
summoned
by
this
unknown
friend
to
go
with
him
to
see
a
certain
person
who
must
see
me
must
see
you
too
that
s
all
i
know
come
along
do
nt
wait
my
friend
time
is
precious
said
the
muffled
voice
of
the
unknown
man
mr
mordecai
frowned
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
dubiously
fear
no
evil
my
friend
but
come
with
me
continued
the
stranger
in
a
reassuring
tone
the
storm
will
not
destroy
us
mordecai
i
have
tried
its
fury
so
far
said
the
rabbi
come
on
reluctantly
mr
mordecai
obeyed
and
hastily
preparing
himself
for
the
weather
turned
out
into
the
darkness
and
the
storm
with
the
rabbi
and
the
guide
onward
they
and
few
words
were
uttered
by
either
as
they
proceeded
on
their
unknown
way
at
length
the
guide
stopped
suddenly
at
the
corner
of
a
lonely
obscure
street
and
said
there
gentlemen
in
that
low
tenement
opposite
where
a
light
gleams
from
the
window
you
will
find
the
person
who
desires
to
see
you
hasten
to
him
i
shall
be
back
before
you
leave
ascend
the
stairway
and
turn
to
the
left
open
the
door
yourself
there
will
be
no
one
inside
to
admit
you
having
uttered
these
words
the
guide
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
mr
mordecai
and
the
rabbi
were
left
alone
what
can
this
mean
rabbi
abrams
said
mr
mordecai
in
a
low
voice
greatly
excited
suppose
it
should
prove
some
plot
to
decoy
us
into
trouble
i
shall
not
go
a
step
farther
we
may
be
robbed
or
even
murdered
in
that
miserable
place
you
know
this
is
dogg
s
alley
and
it
never
was
a
i
feel
no
fear
friend
mordecai
though
i
admit
the
summons
is
mysterious
if
you
will
follow
i
will
lead
the
way
my
curiosity
impels
me
onward
but
there
s
no
watchman
on
this
lonely
beat
on
this
wild
night
that
we
could
summon
in
a
moment
of
necessity
no
street
lamp
either
you
see
it
s
dark
fearfully
dark
had
we
not
better
wait
till
to
morrow
no
come
on
i
am
fond
of
adventure
let
s
see
a
little
farther
into
this
mystery
and
so
saying
the
rabbi
boldly
crossed
the
slippery
street
mr
mordecai
following
timidly
behind
they
were
soon
standing
in
the
narrow
door
way
that
led
up
the
stairs
they
ascended
slowly
and
turning
to
the
left
they
discerned
through
the
crevice
beneath
the
door
a
faint
light
to
this
chamber
they
softly
groped
their
way
and
tapped
gently
on
the
door
no
reply
shall
we
go
in
whispered
the
banker
yes
come
on
i
do
not
feel
afraid
gently
turning
the
bolt
they
opened
the
door
the
lamp
upon
the
table
by
the
window
revealed
the
contents
of
the
apartment
in
a
corner
upon
a
rude
bed
lay
a
snowy
mull
muslin
dress
and
white
shawl
as
she
leaned
forward
on
the
cane
and
looked
steadily
at
the
old
woman
her
long
black
hair
loosened
and
disordered
by
tossing
about
all
night
hung
over
her
shoulders
and
gave
a
weird
almost
supernatural
aspect
to
the
blanched
and
sorrowful
young
face
which
in
that
strange
chill
light
seemed
wellnigh
as
rigid
and
pallid
as
a
corpse
hannah
hinton
god
have
mercy
who
are
you
hannah
seized
the
spade
and
brandished
it
with
hands
that
shook
from
terror
you
wicked
woman
do
you
want
to
kill
me
put
down
that
spade
regina
advanced
but
the
old
woman
retreated
still
waving
the
spade
hannah
are
you
afraid
of
me
good
lord
is
it
you
regina
your
sin
makes
you
a
coward
did
you
really
think
me
a
ghost
it
is
true
i
am
afraid
of
everything
now
was
so
brave
but
what
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you
were
crippled
what
are
you
tracking
me
for
she
threw
down
the
spade
ran
forward
and
seized
the
girl
s
shoulder
while
a
scowl
of
mingled
fear
and
rage
darkened
her
countenance
you
are
watching
trailing
me
like
a
bloodhound
is
it
any
of
your
business
where
i
go
suppose
i
do
choose
to
come
here
and
say
my
prayers
among
the
dead
while
other
folks
are
sound
asleep
in
their
beds
who
has
the
right
to
hinder
me
do
nt
tell
stories
hannah
if
you
really
said
your
prayers
you
would
never
have
come
here
to
sell
your
soul
to
satan
tightening
her
clutch
the
old
woman
shook
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
slender
weed
and
an
ashen
hue
settled
upon
her
wrinkled
features
as
she
cried
in
an
unnaturally
shrill
quavering
tone
aha
you
were
eavesdropping
yesterday
in
the
church
how
i
wish
to
you
watched
me
you
mean
to
disgrace
me
to
ruin
me
to
arrest
me
you
do
but
you
shall
not
i
will
strangle
you
first
take
your
hands
off
my
shoulders
hannah
do
you
think
you
can
scare
me
with
such
wild
desperate
threats
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
and
in
the
second
you
know
very
well
you
dare
not
kill
me
let
go
my
shoulder
you
hurt
me
very
white
but
fearless
the
young
face
was
lifted
to
hers
and
before
those
wrathful
glittering
eyes
that
flashed
like
blue
steel
hannah
quailed
will
you
promise
not
to
betray
me
i
will
promise
nothing
while
you
threaten
me
sit
down
you
are
shaking
all
over
as
if
you
had
an
ague
when
i
came
here
i
had
no
intention
of
betraying
you
i
only
wanted
to
prevent
you
from
committing
a
sin
are
you
going
to
have
a
spasm
do
sit
down
limbs
seemed
indeed
unable
to
support
her
when
she
sank
down
on
the
stone
base
of
the
shaft
regina
stood
before
her
leaning
more
heavily
upon
the
cane
i
heard
all
that
you
said
yesterday
yet
i
was
not
eavesdropping
you
came
and
stood
under
the
window
where
i
sat
and
if
you
had
looked
up
would
have
seen
me
when
i
learned
you
were
engaged
in
a
wicked
plot
i
determined
to
try
to
stop
you
before
it
was
too
late
i
followed
you
here
hoping
that
you
would
give
that
paper
to
me
instead
of
to
that
bold
bad
man
for
though
you
did
very
wrong
i
ca
nt
believe
that
you
have
a
wicked
cruel
heart
she
paused
but
the
only
response
was
a
deep
groan
and
hannah
shrouded
her
face
in
her
arms
hannah
did
my
mother
ever
injure
you
ever
harm
you
in
any
way
yes
she
caused
me
to
steal
and
i
was
as
honest
as
an
angel
until
she
came
that
freezing
night
so
many
years
ago
and
showed
me
by
her
efforts
her
anxiety
to
get
the
paper
how
valuable
it
was
beside
it
was
on
her
account
that
my
nephew
went
to
destruction
and
i
was
sure
all
the
blame
and
suspicion
would
fall
on
her
it
seemed
so
clear
that
she
stole
the
paper
i
knew
mr
hargrove
gave
her
a
copy
of
it
and
i
only
wanted
to
sell
the
paper
itself
to
the
old
general
in
europe
because
i
was
poor
and
had
not
money
enough
to
stop
work
i
have
not
had
a
happy
day
since
my
conscience
has
tormented
me
i
have
carried
a
mountain
of
lead
upon
my
soul
day
and
night
and
at
last
when
peleg
came
and
i
was
about
to
get
my
gold
the
lord
interfered
and
took
it
out
of
my
hands
oh
it
is
an
awful
thing
to
shut
your
eyes
and
stop
your
ears
and
run
down
a
the
bottom
for
you
and
to
feel
yourself
suddenly
jerked
back
by
something
which
you
know
almighty
god
has
sent
to
stop
you
he
sent
that
lightning
to
burn
up
the
paper
and
i
feel
that
his
curse
will
follow
me
to
my
grave
not
if
you
earnestly
repent
and
pray
for
his
forgiveness
hannah
raised
her
grey
head
and
gazed
incredulously
at
the
pale
delicate
face
into
the
violet
eyes
that
watched
her
with
almost
tender
compassion
oh
child
when
our
hands
are
tied
and
we
are
so
helpless
we
ca
nt
do
any
more
mischief
who
believes
in
our
repentance
i
do
hannah
and
how
much
more
merciful
is
god
you
do
nt
mean
that
you
would
ever
trust
me
ever
believe
in
me
again
her
hand
caught
the
white
muslin
dress
and
her
haggard
wrinkled
face
was
full
of
eager
breathless
supplication
yes
hannah
i
would
i
do
not
believe
you
will
ever
well
as
the
tree
where
you
hid
the
stolen
paper
what
do
you
think
would
have
become
of
your
poor
wicked
soul
you
intended
to
sell
that
paper
to
a
person
who
hates
my
mother
and
who
would
have
used
it
to
injure
her
but
she
is
in
god
s
hands
and
you
was
feared
she
might
die
without
having
recovered
her
reason
the
crisis
approached
and
dr
hardy
watched
her
silently
for
many
hours
he
had
done
his
utmost
and
though
he
hoped
faintly
he
feared
the
worst
mrs
moffat
s
whispered
loquacity
was
awed
into
silence
kitty
wept
silently
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
praying
fervently
as
she
slippers
his
long
hands
crossed
upon
each
other
behind
his
back
casting
out
occasionally
fierce
glances
from
his
cavernous
brows
he
came
and
stood
like
a
thundercloud
by
the
doctor
s
side
any
change
he
whispered
the
doctor
shook
his
head
what
do
you
think
any
chance
the
doctor
looked
at
his
watch
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
hand
yes
while
she
breathes
there
s
a
chance
i
suppose
replied
the
doctor
without
looking
up
but
changing
uneasily
his
position
well
i
have
an
awful
headache
i
will
lie
down
in
the
next
room
if
she
is
worse
you
can
call
me
and
the
cloud
disappeared
althea
had
been
some
time
sleeping
quietly
neither
articulating
nor
moaning
dr
hardy
watched
her
as
only
doctors
watch
their
patients
it
was
more
to
him
than
a
question
of
life
and
death
it
was
somewhat
like
the
alchemist
trembling
with
hope
and
fear
over
his
costly
glanced
hastily
around
and
closed
again
dr
hardy
was
not
surprised
for
the
last
half
hour
he
had
been
expecting
this
but
he
had
given
no
sign
when
her
eyes
again
opened
he
put
some
drops
to
her
lips
which
she
readily
swallowed
by
and
bye
she
gave
a
look
of
thorough
consciousness
accompanied
with
an
effort
to
speak
again
in
an
hour
she
looked
earnestly
at
dr
hardy
and
moved
her
lips
he
bent
low
to
listen
and
only
himself
caught
her
words
send
for
the
priest
dr
hardy
frowned
was
this
old
anxiety
going
yet
to
ruin
all
could
nt
she
die
or
live
without
the
priest
you
are
going
to
get
well
now
he
whispered
in
reply
send
for
father
ryan
for
god
s
sake
she
again
repeated
so
forcibly
that
kitty
caught
the
words
i
will
go
for
him
she
said
eagerly
but
the
doctor
interfered
no
i
will
see
mr
his
future
hostility
was
not
a
pleasing
prospective
to
the
easy
going
doctor
ever
ready
to
propitiate
mr
rush
was
like
a
lion
aroused
from
his
sleep
in
which
he
had
found
temporary
oblivion
of
a
torturing
headache
the
doctor
s
words
were
not
audible
in
the
sick
room
but
kitty
distinctly
heard
the
reply
of
thornton
rush
i
tell
you
i
do
nt
care
i
do
nt
believe
it
will
make
the
least
difference
if
she
has
a
mind
to
worry
let
her
worry
i
wo
nt
have
a
catholic
priest
in
the
house
i
ll
have
the
devil
first
if
she
is
going
to
live
she
will
live
anyhow
i
have
never
thought
she
would
die
yet
for
god
s
sake
let
me
alone
and
do
nt
waken
me
again
no
matter
what
happens
the
doctor
returned
with
lugubrious
visage
but
kitty
s
was
radiant
she
was
seized
with
a
thought
or
an
inspiration
and
she
whispered
i
will
take
all
the
me
it
is
a
good
time
he
has
left
orders
to
be
let
alone
the
priest
can
come
and
go
before
he
knows
it
and
she
darted
out
without
another
word
the
doctor
and
mrs
moffat
looked
smilingly
across
at
each
other
in
the
faint
lamp
light
but
neither
made
a
movement
for
kitty
s
detention
as
the
faithful
girl
had
said
the
priest
came
and
went
before
the
master
knew
anything
about
it
and
althea
having
passed
through
her
earthly
purgatory
and
now
hovering
as
she
thought
upon
the
borders
of
death
had
been
baptized
by
water
into
newness
of
life
and
been
strengthened
by
that
heavenly
food
which
is
more
and
diviner
than
the
bread
of
angels
chapter
xxviii
mysterious
disappearance
althea
was
very
weak
but
continued
slowly
to
recover
several
days
elapsed
during
which
time
thornton
s
pain
in
the
head
had
been
upon
the
increase
and
other
alarming
symptoms
had
been
developed
these
were
intensely
strengthened
by
the
imprudence
of
a
meddlesome
neighbor
may
have
been
more
than
the
ninth
part
of
a
man
in
some
respects
but
when
under
pretence
of
a
friendly
call
he
informed
thornton
rush
already
very
sick
that
the
priest
father
ryan
had
baptized
althea
we
say
when
he
did
this
intentionally
and
with
malice
aforethought
and
with
a
sinful
love
of
tale
bearing
and
with
utter
recklessness
as
to
consequences
he
proved
himself
infinitely
less
even
than
ordinary
tailors
of
the
proverbial
size
he
deserved
the
punishment
of
being
hissed
by
his
own
goose
the
effect
of
this
ill
advised
news
upon
thornton
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
what
increased
it
ten
fold
was
the
man
s
utter
impotence
to
resent
or
punish
what
had
been
done
his
ravings
were
fearful
his
imprecations
multiplied
vain
were
the
doctor
s
warnings
that
his
anger
would
aggravate
his
disease
he
continued
to
rave
until
he
became
unconscious
of
the
words
he
uttered
to
all
in
the
house
it
was
a
relief
when
this
man
passed
into
unconscious
delirium
one
can
listen
to
horror
and
disgust
to
revilings
and
railings
sanely
spoken
on
that
night
which
followed
curtis
coe
s
wicked
impertinence
two
men
sat
up
with
the
sick
man
they
must
both
have
fallen
asleep
at
one
and
the
same
time
for
they
discovered
on
coming
to
their
senses
that
thornton
rush
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
lamp
was
burning
even
the
fire
in
the
stove
had
not
died
out
having
searched
the
room
they
gave
the
alarm
and
thoroughly
searched
the
house
then
all
the
outhouses
and
finally
the
town
all
classes
friend
and
foe
were
aroused
a
general
panic
prevailed
each
one
considered
himself
in
danger
while
thornton
rush
as
a
lunatic
was
at
large
posters
were
sent
abroad
and
telegrams
announced
the
mysterious
disappearance
to
the
lines
and
there
may
i
though
vile
as
he
wash
all
my
sins
away
the
dying
man
held
out
his
hand
as
if
beckoning
her
over
again
his
lips
moved
and
stooping
she
heard
again
sing
as
her
voice
arose
again
slowly
repeating
the
words
her
heart
made
supplication
for
the
soul
so
rapidly
passing
away
hymn
after
hymn
was
sung
all
speaking
of
jesus
and
his
great
love
for
sinners
and
to
agnes
it
seemed
that
jesus
was
himself
speaking
in
each
she
knew
he
was
there
in
the
midst
of
them
and
wondered
if
the
sick
man
saw
him
bending
down
she
whispered
o
how
the
saviour
loves
you
do
you
love
him
he
looked
at
have
the
look
that
seems
to
be
measuring
eternity
and
then
his
hands
were
raised
and
clasped
while
his
eyes
remained
fixed
on
hers
he
is
asking
you
to
pray
said
the
nurse
he
is
near
gone
there
was
no
time
to
listen
to
satan
now
or
to
think
of
anything
but
this
soul
venturing
out
into
the
unknown
future
was
it
prepared
o
how
she
plead
for
him
as
if
face
to
face
she
talked
with
god
the
holy
spirit
gave
her
words
and
great
assurance
it
seemed
as
if
the
answer
must
come
he
had
promised
to
hear
and
to
give
the
things
desired
he
had
never
refused
to
listen
to
the
feeblest
petition
and
here
was
a
burdened
soul
was
not
the
saviour
near
to
take
from
it
its
burdens
so
she
entreated
as
though
she
alone
could
save
him
yet
knowing
well
that
jesus
alone
had
power
to
forgive
sins
they
had
been
sobbing
around
her
but
she
did
a
sudden
calm
and
she
felt
that
she
had
prevailed
as
they
rose
from
their
knees
something
about
the
dying
man
attracted
them
while
they
had
been
kneeling
jesus
had
drawn
near
and
whispered
to
him
the
power
and
music
of
that
voice
were
ringing
in
his
ear
the
beauty
of
his
smile
was
flooding
his
soul
and
radiating
his
face
in
that
moment
he
had
passed
from
death
into
life
his
wife
and
child
looked
at
him
with
awe
the
nurse
drew
back
as
if
the
place
were
too
holy
ground
for
him
only
agnes
and
the
new
born
soul
understood
it
but
it
had
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
saviour
before
long
with
the
same
indescribable
expression
it
passed
away
to
be
forever
with
the
lord
they
went
home
silently
as
they
had
gone
there
but
a
new
feeling
had
taken
possession
of
them
they
had
seen
strange
things
new
thoughts
had
been
given
them
and
death
had
not
to
them
its
old
terror

guy
gives
his
views
in
full
martha
was
fairly
installed
as
kitchen
maid
to
the
great
delight
of
agnes
while
ruth
congratulated
herself
that
there
would
be
no
more
dishwashing
for
her
a
thing
she
detested
above
all
others
she
appears
anxious
to
learn
does
nt
she
asked
agnes
she
was
a
good
scholar
and
perfectly
obedient
i
think
you
will
like
her
ruth
if
we
gain
her
affections
i
am
sure
she
will
do
anything
for
us
but
then
we
must
be
careful
agnes
it
does
not
answer
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
servants
they
are
sure
to
become
consequential
and
to
value
themselves
too
highly
if
you
notice
them
much
but
she
is
a
child
and
everything
is
strange
besides
when
she
thinks
of
her
father
and
of
separation
from
her
mother
she
must
be
sad
and
perhaps
may
try
your
patience
i
shall
help
all
i
can
but
she
had
my
sake
sister
there
was
no
reply
to
this
and
agnes
was
afraid
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
proposing
such
a
child
instead
of
one
more
fully
grown
that
night
after
martha
had
gone
to
bed
she
slipped
up
stairs
to
know
if
she
had
repeated
her
prayers
o
yes
ma
am
i
always
say
them
i
should
be
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
if
i
did
not
we
have
a
great
deal
to
thank
god
for
martha
every
day
he
cares
for
us
and
it
is
the
least
we
can
do
to
thank
him
do
you
thank
him
for
what
you
have
or
only
ask
to
have
more
i
guess
i
ask
most
for
the
things
i
want
i
forget
about
thanking
only
i
mean
it
yes
and
god
sees
that
you
mean
it
but
he
expects
you
to
tell
him
so
now
if
i
were
to
give
you
a
great
many
things
every
day
and
you
of
other
things
you
desired
to
have
i
should
call
you
ungrateful
and
not
give
you
any
more
do
nt
you
see
how
it
is
now
when
you
are
praying
be
sure
to
ask
not
to
be
allowed
to
forget
pleasing
god
by
doing
every
thing
as
if
he
were
here
looking
at
you
are
you
warm
enough
child
o
yes
ma
am
miss
ruth
came
up
and
tucked
me
in
nicely
and
and
what
she
kissed
me
and
said
good
night
agnes
s
first
impulse
was
to
exclaim
with
surprise
but
checking
herself
she
stooped
down
saying
and
i
must
follow
miss
ruth
s
example
i
suppose
be
a
good
girl
martha
and
miss
ruth
and
i
will
be
your
friends
i
need
have
no
fears
ruth
could
never
be
anything
but
kind
although
people
so
often
misunderstand
her
and
think
her
stern
she
will
never
let
generosity
carry
away
her
sense
of
justice
thought
agnes
as
she
descended
to
the
sitting
room
guy
was
home
that
night
as
agnes
entered
the
room
he
laid
down
his
book
with
the
remark
i
say
agnes
brother
snowden
is
considered
the
salt
of
the
earth
among
you
church
people
is
nt
he
i
suppose
he
is
a
good
man
i
do
nt
know
much
about
him
why
do
you
ask
was
the
reply
well
only
that
it
strikes
me
that
kind
of
salt
would
not
she
was
not
perhaps
exactly
the
young
person
that
it
would
be
entirely
safe
for
the
timid
embarrassed
or
inexperienced
of
my
sex
to
meet
alone
she
shut
down
the
piano
and
having
carefully
reclosed
all
the
windows
and
doors
and
restored
the
house
to
its
former
desolate
condition
she
stepped
from
the
veranda
and
proceeded
directly
to
the
cabin
of
the
unintellectual
hawkins
that
reared
its
adobe
chimney
above
the
umbrage
a
to
her
impulsive
knock
and
the
fool
of
five
forks
stood
before
her
miss
milly
had
never
before
seen
the
man
designated
by
this
infelicitous
title
and
as
he
stepped
backward
in
half
courtesy
and
half
astonishment
she
was
for
the
moment
disconcerted
he
was
tall
finely
formed
and
dark
bearded
above
cheeks
a
little
hollowed
by
care
and
ill
health
shone
a
pair
of
hazel
eyes
very
large
very
gentle
but
inexpressibly
sad
and
mournful
this
was
certainly
not
the
kind
of
man
miss
milly
had
expected
to
see
yet
after
her
first
embarrassment
had
passed
the
very
circumstance
oddly
enough
added
to
her
indignation
and
stung
her
wounded
pride
still
more
deeply
nevertheless
the
arch
hypocrite
instantly
changed
her
tactics
with
the
swift
intuition
of
her
sex
i
have
come
she
said
with
a
dazzling
smile
infinitely
more
dangerous
than
her
former
dignified
severity
i
have
come
to
ask
your
pardon
for
a
great
liberty
i
have
just
the
hill
is
yours
i
was
so
much
pleased
with
its
exterior
that
i
left
my
friends
for
a
moment
below
here
she
continued
artfully
with
a
slight
wave
of
the
hand
as
if
indicating
a
band
of
fearless
amazons
without
and
waiting
to
avenge
any
possible
insult
offered
to
one
of
their
number
and
ventured
to
enter
it
finding
it
unoccupied
as
i
had
been
told
i
am
afraid
i
had
the
audacity
to
sit
down
and
amuse
myself
for
a
few
moments
at
the
piano
while
waiting
for
my
friends
hawkins
raised
his
beautiful
eyes
to
hers
he
saw
a
very
pretty
girl
with
frank
gray
eyes
glistening
with
excitement
with
two
red
slightly
freckled
cheeks
glowing
a
little
under
his
eyes
with
a
short
scarlet
upper
lip
turned
back
like
a
rose
leaf
over
a
little
line
of
white
teeth
as
she
breathed
somewhat
hurriedly
in
her
nervous
excitement
he
saw
all
this
calmly
quietly
and
save
for
the
natural
uneasiness
of
a
of
his
pulse
i
knowed
it
he
said
simply
i
heerd
ye
as
i
kem
up
miss
milly
was
furious
at
his
grammar
his
dialect
his
coolness
and
still
more
at
the
suspicion
that
he
was
an
active
member
of
her
invisible
claque
ah
she
said
still
smiling
then
i
think
i
heard
you
i
reckon
not
he
interrupted
gravely
i
did
nt
stay
long
i
found
the
boys
hanging
round
the
house
and
i
allowed
at
first
i
d
go
in
and
kinder
warn
you
but
they
promised
to
keep
still
and
you
looked
so
comfortable
and
wrapped
up
in
your
music
that
i
had
nt
the
heart
to
disturb
you
and
kem
away
i
hope
he
added
earnestly
they
did
nt
let
on
ez
they
heerd
you
they
ai
nt
a
bad
lot
them
blazin
star
boys
though
they
re
a
little
hard
at
times
would
a
a
a
cat
continued
mr
hawkins
blushing
with
a
faint
apprehension
of
the
inelegance
of
his
simile
no
no
said
miss
milly
feeling
suddenly
very
angry
with
herself
the
fool
and
the
entire
male
population
of
five
forks
no
i
have
behaved
foolishly
i
suppose
and
if
they
had
it
would
have
served
me
right
but
i
only
wanted
to
apologize
to
you
you
ll
find
every
thing
as
you
left
it
good
day
she
turned
to
go
mr
hawkins
began
to
feel
embarrassed
i
d
have
asked
ye
to
sit
down
he
said
finally
if
it
hed
been
a
place
fit
for
a
lady
i
oughter
done
so
enny
way
i
do
nt
know
what
kept
me
from
it
but
i
ai
nt
well
miss
times
i
get
a
sort
o
dumb
ager
it
s
the
ditches
i
think
miss
and
i
instantly
miss
arnot
was
all
sympathy
her
quick
woman
s
heart
was
touched
can
i
can
any
thing
be
done
she
asked
more
timidly
than
she
had
before
spoken
no
not
onless
ye
remember
suthin
about
these
pills
he
exhibited
a
box
containing
about
half
a
dozen
i
forget
the
direction
i
do
nt
seem
to
remember
much
any
way
these
times
they
re
jones
s
vegetable
compound
if
ye
ve
ever
took
em
ye
ll
remember
whether
the
reg
lar
dose
is
eight
they
ai
nt
but
six
here
but
perhaps
ye
never
tuk
any
he
added
deprecatingly
no
said
miss
milly
curtly
she
had
usually
a
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
but
somehow
mr
hawkins
s
eccentricity
only
pained
her
will
you
let
me
see
you
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
said
again
after
another
embarrassing
pause
miss
arnot
felt
instantly
that
such
an
act
would
condone
her
trespass
some
of
her
invisible
admirers
or
even
her
companions
and
with
all
her
erratic
impulses
she
was
nevertheless
a
woman
and
did
not
entirely
despise
the
verdict
of
conventionality
she
smiled
sweetly
and
assented
and
in
another
moment
the
two
were
lost
in
the
shadows
of
the
wood
like
many
other
apparently
trivial
acts
in
an
uneventful
life
it
was
decisive
as
she
expected
she
met
two
or
three
of
her
late
applauders
whom
she
fancied
looked
sheepish
and
embarrassed
she
met
also
her
companions
looking
for
her
in
some
alarm
who
really
appeared
astonished
at
her
escort
and
she
fancied
a
trifle
envious
of
her
evident
success
i
fear
that
miss
arnot
in
response
to
their
anxious
inquiries
did
not
state
entirely
the
truth
but
without
actual
assertion
led
them
to
believe
that
she
had
at
a
very
early
stage
of
the
proceeding
completely
subjugated
this
weak
minded
giant
and
had
brought
him
triumphantly
to
opportunity
but
for
heaven
s
sake
if
it
s
to
lead
anywhere
do
nt
come
back
with
that
visage
de
croquemort
you
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
bury
your
heart
not
to
offer
it
to
a
pretty
woman
you
re
much
better
when
you
smile
come
do
yourself
justice
yes
he
said
i
must
do
myself
justice
and
abruptly
with
a
bow
he
took
his
departure
vii
he
felt
when
he
found
himself
unobserved
in
the
open
air
that
he
must
plunge
into
violent
action
walk
fast
and
far
and
defer
the
opportunity
for
thought
he
strode
away
into
the
forest
swinging
his
cane
throwing
back
his
head
gazing
away
into
the
verdurous
vistas
and
following
the
road
without
a
purpose
he
felt
immensely
excited
but
he
could
hardly
have
said
whether
was
joyous
as
all
increase
of
freedom
is
joyous
something
seemed
to
have
been
knocked
down
across
his
path
his
destiny
appeared
to
have
rounded
a
cape
and
brought
him
into
sight
of
an
open
sea
but
his
freedom
resolved
itself
somehow
into
the
need
of
despising
all
mankind
with
a
single
exception
and
the
fact
of
madame
de
mauves
inhabiting
a
planet
contaminated
by
the
presence
of
this
baser
multitude
kept
his
elation
from
seeming
a
pledge
of
ideal
bliss
but
she
was
there
and
circumstance
now
forced
them
to
be
intimate
she
had
ceased
to
have
what
men
call
a
secret
for
him
and
this
fact
itself
brought
with
it
a
sort
of
rapture
he
had
no
prevision
that
he
should
profit
in
the
vulgar
sense
by
the
extraordinary
position
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
it
might
be
but
a
cruel
trick
of
destiny
to
make
hope
a
harsher
mockery
and
renunciation
a
keener
suffering
but
above
all
this
rose
the
conviction
that
she
could
do
nothing
that
would
not
deepen
his
as
it
was
in
itself
was
to
force
the
beauty
of
her
character
into
more
perfect
relief
that
made
him
stride
along
as
if
he
were
celebrating
a
kind
of
spiritual
festival
he
rambled
at
random
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
found
at
last
that
he
had
left
the
forest
behind
him
and
had
wandered
into
an
unfamiliar
region
it
was
a
perfectly
rural
scene
and
the
still
summer
day
gave
it
a
charm
for
which
its
meagre
elements
but
half
accounted
longmore
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
characteristically
french
all
the
french
novels
seemed
to
have
described
it
all
the
french
landscapists
to
have
painted
it
the
fields
and
trees
were
of
a
cool
metallic
green
the
grass
looked
as
if
it
might
stain
your
trousers
and
the
foliage
your
hands
the
clear
light
had
a
sort
of
mild
grayness
the
sunbeams
were
of
silver
rather
than
gold
a
great
red
roofed
high
stacked
farm
house
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
straggling
yard
surveyed
the
high
road
on
one
side
stream
half
choked
with
emerald
rushes
and
edged
with
gray
aspens
occupied
the
opposite
quarter
the
meadows
rolled
and
sloped
away
gently
to
the
low
horizon
which
was
barely
concealed
by
the
continuous
line
of
clipped
and
marshalled
trees
the
prospect
was
not
rich
but
it
had
a
frank
homeliness
which
touched
the
young
man
s
fancy
it
was
full
of
light
atmosphere
and
diffused
sunshine
and
if
it
was
prosaic
it
was
soothing
longmore
was
disposed
to
walk
further
and
he
advanced
along
the
road
beneath
the
poplars
in
twenty
minutes
he
came
to
a
village
which
straggled
away
to
the
right
among
orchards
and
potagers
on
the
left
at
a
stone
s
throw
from
the
road
stood
a
little
pink
faced
inn
which
reminded
him
that
he
had
not
breakfasted
having
left
home
with
a
prevision
of
hospitality
from
madame
de
mauves
in
the
inn
he
found
a
brick
tiled
parlor
and
a
hostess
in
sabots
and
a
white
cap
whom
over
the
omelette
she
speedily
served
him
accompanied
it
he
assured
that
she
was
a
true
artist
to
reward
his
compliment
she
invited
him
to
smoke
his
cigar
in
her
little
garden
behind
the
house
here
he
found
a
tonnelle
and
a
view
of
ripening
crops
stretching
down
to
the
stream
the
tonnelle
was
rather
close
and
he
preferred
to
lounge
on
a
bench
against
the
pink
wall
in
the
sun
which
was
not
too
hot
here
as
he
rested
and
gazed
and
mused
he
fell
into
a
train
of
thought
which
in
an
indefinable
fashion
was
a
soft
influence
from
the
scene
about
him
his
heart
which
had
been
beating
fast
for
the
past
three
hours
gradually
checked
its
pulses
and
left
him
looking
at
life
with
a
rather
more
level
gaze
the
homely
tavern
sounds
coming
out
through
the
open
windows
the
sunny
stillness
of
the
fields
and
crops
which
covered
so
much
vigorous
natural
life
suggested
very
little
that
was
transcendental
had
very
little
to
say
about
renunciation
nothing
at
message
from
plain
ripe
nature
to
express
the
unperverted
reality
of
things
to
say
that
the
common
lot
is
not
brilliantly
amusing
and
that
the
part
of
wisdom
is
to
grasp
frankly
at
experience
lest
you
miss
it
altogether
what
reason
there
was
for
his
falling
a
wondering
after
this
whether
a
deeply
wounded
heart
might
be
soothed
and
healed
by
such
a
scene
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
certain
it
is
that
as
he
sat
there
he
had
a
waking
dream
of
an
unhappy
woman
strolling
by
the
slow
flowing
stream
before
him
and
pulling
down
the
blossoming
boughs
in
the
orchards
he
mused
and
mused
and
at
last
found
himself
feeling
angry
that
he
could
not
somehow
think
worse
of
madame
de
mauves
or
at
any
rate
think
otherwise
he
could
fairly
claim
that
in
a
sentimental
way
he
asked
very
little
of
life
he
made
modest
demands
on
passion
why
then
should
his
only
passion
be
born
to
ill
fortune
why
should
his
first
his
last
glimpse
of
positive
perhaps
because
like
many
spirits
of
the
same
man
s
voice
three
times
i
have
called
to
inquire
and
three
times
gone
away
in
despair
i
was
very
tired
but
what
was
the
matter
said
the
gentleman
pausing
in
the
doorway
some
call
of
sudden
illness
a
demand
upon
your
sympathies
nothing
of
the
kind
how
then
said
captain
lancaster
with
an
appearance
of
great
interest
one
does
not
lose
a
pleasure
and
such
a
pleasure
without
at
least
begging
to
know
why
if
it
is
permitted
we
began
to
think
that
the
witches
must
have
got
hold
of
you
in
that
dark
room
one
did
said
the
girl
so
gravely
that
captain
lancaster
was
posed
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
ears
were
listening
but
there
was
something
in
her
nature
which
always
disdained
to
creep
out
of
a
difficulty
so
she
stood
still
and
answered
as
he
had
spoken
aloud
o
miss
a
fib
not
a
real
witch
pretty
genuine
i
think
said
hazel
with
her
half
laugh
now
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
to
puzzle
people
like
telling
them
the
truth
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
were
puzzled
stuart
nightingale
and
half
a
dozen
more
came
up
at
the
instant
and
the
question
of
the
game
to
be
played
for
the
time
scattered
all
other
questions
for
a
while
now
the
little
green
at
chickaree
was
a
pretty
sight
dotted
with
a
moving
crowd
of
figures
in
gay
coloured
dresses
moving
in
graceful
lines
or
standing
in
pretty
attitudes
the
play
the
shifting
of
places
the
cries
and
the
laughter
all
made
a
flashing
changing
picture
full
of
life
and
full
of
picturesque
prettiness
the
interests
of
the
game
were
at
first
absorbing
when
a
long
match
had
been
played
however
and
there
was
a
pause
for
refreshments
there
was
also
a
chance
for
rolling
balls
in
the
more
airy
manner
wych
hazel
night
stuart
nightingale
demanded
softly
as
he
brought
the
little
lady
of
the
house
an
ice
i
could
not
stay
summoned
home
by
no
disaster
it
was
a
sort
of
disaster
to
me
to
be
obliged
to
go
said
wych
hazel
but
i
found
neither
earthquake
nor
volcano
at
home
who
came
for
you
hazel
said
phinny
powder
pushing
into
the
group
which
was
forming
i
said
it
was
downright
wicked
to
let
you
go
off
so
how
did
we
know
but
that
something
dreadful
had
got
hold
of
you
i
thought
they
ought
all
of
them
to
go
in
a
body
and
knock
the
doors
down
and
find
out
but
after
your
message
they
would
nt
who
did
come
for
you
hazel
who
did
said
hazel
do
you
think
it
could
have
been
the
same
parties
who
once
sent
away
my
carriage
when
i
wanted
it
no
said
who
did
come
for
you
hazel
nobody
knew
where
you
were
and
what
made
you
go
if
there
was
no
earthquake
at
home
as
you
said
were
you
made
to
go
really
asked
mme
lasalle
slyly
has
josephine
hit
the
mark
with
a
stray
arrow
o
of
course
i
was
made
to
go
or
i
should
nt
have
gone
said
wych
hazel
lightly
my
own
carriage
came
for
me
josephine
and
i
came
home
in
it
do
you
feel
any
better
no
i
do
nt
said
that
young
lady
boldly
while
others
who
were
silent
used
their
eyes
you
did
nt
order
it
and
i
just
want
to
know
who
did
o
hazel
i
want
to
ask
you
but
she
lowered
her
voice
and
glanced
round
her
suspiciously
is
it
safe
where
is
that
old
mr
do
you
see
him
anywhere
he
has
eyes
and
it
s
safe
hazel
my
dear
have
you
got
two
guardians
you
poor
creature
have
you
only
just
found
that
out
said
hazel
drawing
a
little
back
from
the
whisper
and
answering
aloud
prim
what
will
you
have
mr
may
please
bring
another
ice
for
miss
maryland
well
i
ve
guessed
it
all
summer
said
kitty
fisher
putting
her
word
in
now
i
always
knew
that
when
miss
kennedy
turned
round
the
duke
turned
too
to
see
what
she
was
looking
at
if
truth
be
no
slander
it
is
sometimes
full
as
hard
to
bear
wych
hazel
eat
her
own
ice
for
the
next
two
minutes
and
wondered
what
it
was
hazel
my
dear
you
had
need
to
be
a
saint
mme
lasalle
whispered
it
toolong
something
not
to
be
borne
but
the
fun
of
it
is
broke
in
kitty
again
that
we
all
took
now
behold
c
est
tout
au
contraire
since
the
day
of
the
ride
it
had
been
war
to
the
knife
with
kitty
fisher
kitty
kitty
said
mr
kingsland
in
soft
deprecation
my
dear
mme
lasalle
went
on
mockingly
perhaps
he
would
not
approve
of
your
eating
so
much
ice
had
nt
you
better
take
care
must
we
ask
him
about
everything
now
before
we
can
have
you
cried
josephine
in
great
indignation
quite
unfeigned
though
possibly
springing
from
a
double
root
o
was
it
he
came
for
you
to
greenbush
but
with
that
hazel
roused
herself
you
had
better
ask
him
anything
you
want
answered
she
said
i
think
he
has
quite
a
genius
that
way
what
way
o
you
know
friends
perhaps
she
likes
it
what
way
hazel
does
he
speak
soft
when
he
gives
his
orders
said
kitty
fisher
and
oh
miss
kennedy
said
little
molly
seaton
is
nt
it
awfully
nice
to
have
such
a
handsome
man
tell
you
what
to
do
now
hazel
had
been
at
her
wits
end
feeling
as
if
there
was
a
trap
for
her
whatever
she
said
or
did
not
say
pain
and
nervousness
and
almost
fright
had
kept
her
still
but
molly
s
question
brought
things
to
such
a
climax
that
she
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
little
laugh
and
so
answered
everybody
at
once
in
the
best
manner
possible
the
sound
of
her
laugh
brought
back
the
gentlemen
too
roaming
off
after
their
own
ices
and
that
would
make
a
diversion
but
it
happy
cry
how
differently
we
shall
all
take
europe
she
continued
in
a
moment
there
is
albert
i
honestly
believe
he
will
live
in
his
baedeker
just
because
he
can
see
no
further
than
the
covers
of
a
book
you
need
not
laugh
for
it
is
a
fact
that
people
confined
for
years
to
a
room
ca
nt
see
beyond
its
limits
when
they
are
taken
out
into
broader
space
and
i
do
nt
see
why
it
should
nt
be
the
same
with
a
man
who
lives
in
his
books
as
albert
does
he
sees
the
world
in
his
spirit
he
gets
a
microscopic
view
of
it
yes
replied
mae
grandiloquently
and
edith
always
sees
just
what
he
does
suggested
eric
maliciously
now
boys
said
miss
mae
assuming
suddenly
a
mighty
patronage
i
will
not
have
you
hit
at
albert
and
edith
in
this
way
it
will
be
very
annoying
to
them
they
have
a
right
to
act
just
as
absurdly
as
they
choose
we
none
of
us
know
how
people
who
are
falling
in
love
would
act
no
the
boys
agreed
this
was
quite
true
and
i
really
do
suppose
they
are
falling
in
love
do
nt
you
queried
mae
yes
they
did
both
believe
it
just
here
up
came
the
two
subjects
of
conversation
looking
it
must
be
confessed
as
much
like
one
subject
as
any
man
and
wife
what
are
you
talking
of
asked
edith
madame
tussaud
or
a
french
salad
it
has
a
foreign
flavor
there
you
are
mistaken
replied
the
frank
eric
we
were
discussing
you
two
people
in
the
most
homelike
kind
of
a
way
at
this
edith
blushed
albert
frowned
mae
scowled
at
eric
who
opened
his
eyes
amazedly
norman
mann
looked
over
the
deck
railing
and
laughed
the
wind
blew
the
sailors
heave
ho
ed
near
by
and
there
was
a
grand
tableau
vivant
for
a
few
seconds
o
come
cried
mae
suppose
we
stop
looking
like
a
set
of
illustrations
for
a
phrenological
journal
expressive
of
the
various
emotions
i
was
only
speculating
on
the
different
sights
we
should
see
in
the
same
places
confess
now
albert
wo
nt
your
eyes
be
forever
hunting
out
old
musty
dusty
volumes
will
not
books
be
your
first
pleasures
in
the
sight
seeing
line
o
no
pictures
cried
edith
that
is
as
you
say
mae
demurely
agreed
and
churches
for
your
mother
yes
and
beer
gardens
for
eric
and
amphitheatres
and
battle
fields
for
mr
mann
and
for
yourself
the
blue
blue
bay
of
naples
a
grove
of
oranges
moonlight
and
a
boat
if
it
please
you
by
the
way
suggested
albert
about
our
plans
we
really
should
begin
to
agitate
the
matter
at
once
yes
to
do
our
fighting
on
shipboard
let
us
agree
to
hoist
the
white
flag
the
day
we
sight
land
else
we
shall
settle
down
into
a
regular
war
of
the
roses
and
never
decide
laughed
norman
as
there
are
six
minds
continued
albert
there
will
have
to
be
some
giving
up
why
do
you
look
at
me
enquired
mae
i
am
the
very
most
unselfish
person
in
the
world
i
ll
settle
down
anywhere
for
the
winter
provided
only
that
it
is
not
in
rome
cried
edith
and
albert
and
mrs
jerrold
from
her
camp
chair
o
how
dreadful
the
only
way
to
prevent
it
will
be
for
us
to
stand
firm
boys
and
make
it
a
tie
but
norman
is
especially
eager
to
go
to
rome
said
edith
and
that
makes
us
four
strong
at
once
in
favor
of
that
city
but
is
not
rome
a
fearful
mixture
of
dead
caesar
s
bones
and
dirty
beggars
and
must
nt
one
carry
hundreds
of
dates
at
one
s
finger
tips
to
appreciate
this
and
that
and
the
other
is
it
not
all
tremendously
and
overwhelmingly
historical
and
do
nt
you
have
to
keep
exerting
your
mind
and
thinking
and
remembering
i
would
rather
go
down
to
southern
italy
and
look
at
lazzaroni
lie
on
stone
walls
in
red
cloaks
as
they
do
in
pictures
and
not
be
obliged
to
topple
off
the
common
italian
to
pile
the
gray
stone
with
old
memories
of
some
great
dead
man
everything
is
excitement
in
southern
italy
there
s
vesuvius
and
she
is
nt
dead
like
nero
but
a
living
demon
that
may
erupt
any
night
and
give
you
a
little
red
grave
by
the
sea
for
your
share
she
s
not
nearly
through
yet
laughed
edith
as
mae
paused
for
breath
i
m
only
afraid
said
mae
that
after
i
had
been
down
there
a
week
i
should
forget
english
buy
a
contadina
costume
marry
a
child
of
the
sun
and
run
away
from
this
big
world
with
its
puzzles
and
lessons
and
rights
and
wrongs
imagine
me
in
my
doorway
as
you
passed
in
your
travelling
carriage
hot
and
tired
on
your
way
say
to
sorrento
i
would
dress
my
beautiful
italian
all
up
in
scarlet
flowers
and
wreathe
his
big
hat
and
kiss
his
brown
eyes
and
take
his
brown
hand
and
then
we
would
run
along
by
the
bay
and
laugh
at
you
stiff
grand
world
s
folks
as
we
skipped
look
for
you
if
ever
you
do
disappear
said
norman
mann
but
my
dear
mae
added
albert
though
this
is
amusing
it
is
utterly
useless
amusing
things
always
are
said
mae
the
question
is
shall
we
or
shall
we
not
go
to
rome
for
the
winter
certainly
by
all
means
and
if
i
do
nt
like
it
i
ll
run
away
to
sorrento
and
mae
shook
her
sunny
head
and
twinkled
her
eyes
in
a
fascinating
sort
of
way
that
made
eric
feel
a
proud
brotherly
pleasure
in
this
saucy
young
woman
and
that
gave
norman
mann
a
sort
of
feeling
he
had
had
a
good
deal
of
late
a
feeling
hard
to
define
though
we
have
all
known
it
a
delicious
concoction
of
pleasure
and
pain
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
mae
now
what
is
it
do
nt
tell
me
she
s
not
a
moralist
it
was
for
that
i
fell
in
love
with
her
and
with
rigid
virtue
in
her
person
she
is
a
moralist
but
not
as
you
imply
a
narrow
one
that
s
more
than
a
difference
in
degree
it
s
a
difference
in
kind
i
do
nt
know
whether
i
ever
mentioned
it
but
i
admire
her
extremely
there
is
nothing
narrow
about
her
but
her
experience
everything
else
is
large
my
impression
of
her
is
of
a
person
of
great
capacity
as
yet
wholly
unmeasured
and
untested
some
day
or
other
i
m
sure
she
will
judge
fairly
and
wisely
of
everything
stay
a
bit
cried
roderick
you
re
a
better
catholic
than
the
pope
i
shall
be
content
if
she
judges
fairly
of
me
she
must
not
judge
at
all
she
s
a
grimly
devoted
little
creature
may
she
always
remain
so
changed
as
i
am
i
adore
her
none
the
less
what
becomes
of
all
our
emotions
our
impressions
he
went
on
after
a
long
pause
all
the
material
of
thought
that
life
pours
into
us
at
such
a
rate
during
such
a
memorable
three
months
as
these
there
are
twenty
moments
a
week
a
day
for
that
matter
some
days
that
seem
supreme
twenty
impressions
that
seem
ultimate
that
appear
to
form
an
intellectual
era
but
others
come
treading
on
their
heels
and
sweeping
them
along
and
they
all
melt
like
water
into
water
and
settle
the
question
of
precedence
among
themselves
the
curious
thing
is
that
the
more
the
mind
takes
in
the
more
it
has
space
for
and
that
all
one
s
ideas
are
like
the
irish
people
at
home
who
live
in
the
different
corners
of
a
room
and
take
boarders
i
nt
see
the
limits
of
our
minds
said
rowland
we
are
young
compared
with
what
we
may
one
day
be
that
belongs
to
youth
it
is
perhaps
the
best
part
of
it
they
say
that
old
people
do
find
themselves
at
last
face
to
face
with
a
solid
blank
wall
and
stand
thumping
against
it
in
vain
it
resounds
it
seems
to
have
something
beyond
it
but
it
wo
nt
move
that
s
only
a
reason
for
living
with
open
doors
as
long
as
we
can
open
doors
murmured
roderick
yes
let
us
close
no
doors
that
open
upon
rome
for
this
for
the
mind
is
eternal
summer
but
though
my
doors
may
stand
open
to
day
he
presently
added
i
shall
see
no
visitors
i
want
to
pause
and
breathe
i
want
to
dream
of
a
statue
i
have
been
working
hard
for
three
months
i
have
earned
a
right
to
a
reverie
rowland
and
they
lingered
on
in
broken
desultory
talk
rowland
felt
the
need
for
intellectual
rest
for
a
truce
to
present
care
for
churches
statues
and
pictures
on
even
better
grounds
than
his
companion
inasmuch
as
he
had
really
been
living
roderick
s
intellectual
life
the
past
three
months
as
well
as
his
own
as
he
looked
back
on
these
full
flavored
weeks
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
almost
of
relief
roderick
thus
far
had
justified
his
confidence
and
flattered
his
perspicacity
he
was
rapidly
unfolding
into
an
ideal
brilliancy
he
was
changed
even
more
than
he
himself
suspected
he
had
stepped
without
faltering
into
his
birthright
and
was
spending
money
intellectually
as
lavishly
as
a
young
heir
who
has
just
won
an
obstructive
lawsuit
roderick
s
glance
and
voice
were
the
same
doubtless
as
when
they
enlivened
the
summer
dusk
on
cecilia
s
veranda
but
in
his
person
generally
there
was
an
indefinable
expression
of
experience
rapidly
and
easily
assimilated
quickness
of
his
observation
and
his
free
appropriation
of
whatever
might
serve
his
purpose
he
had
not
been
for
instance
half
an
hour
on
english
soil
before
he
perceived
that
he
was
dressed
like
a
rustic
and
he
had
immediately
reformed
his
toilet
with
the
most
unerring
tact
his
appetite
for
novelty
was
insatiable
and
for
everything
characteristically
foreign
as
it
presented
itself
he
had
an
extravagant
greeting
but
in
half
an
hour
the
novelty
had
faded
he
had
guessed
the
secret
he
had
plucked
out
the
heart
of
the
mystery
and
was
clamoring
for
a
keener
sensation
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
presented
mentally
a
puzzling
spectacle
to
his
companion
he
had
caught
instinctively
the
key
note
of
the
old
world
he
observed
and
enjoyed
he
criticised
and
rhapsodized
but
though
all
things
interested
him
and
many
delighted
him
none
surprised
him
he
had
divined
their
logic
and
measured
their
proportions
and
referred
them
infallibly
to
their
categories
witnessing
the
rate
at
which
he
rowland
at
moments
felt
vaguely
uneasy
for
the
future
the
boy
was
living
too
fast
he
would
have
said
and
giving
alarming
pledges
to
ennui
in
his
later
years
but
we
must
live
as
our
pulses
are
timed
and
roderick
s
struck
the
hour
very
often
he
was
by
imagination
though
he
never
became
in
manner
a
natural
man
of
the
world
he
had
intuitively
as
an
artist
what
one
may
call
the
historic
consciousness
he
had
a
relish
for
social
subtleties
and
mysteries
and
in
perception
when
occasion
offered
him
an
inch
he
never
failed
to
take
an
ell
a
single
glimpse
of
a
social
situation
of
the
elder
type
enabled
him
to
construct
the
whole
with
all
its
complex
chiaroscuro
and
rowland
more
than
once
assured
him
that
he
made
him
believe
in
the
metempsychosis
and
that
he
must
have
lived
in
european
society
in
the
last
century
as
a
gentleman
in
a
cocked
hat
and
brocaded
waistcoat
hudson
asked
rowland
questions
which
poor
rowland
was
equally
unable
to
conceive
where
he
had
picked
up
the
data
roderick
ended
by
answering
them
himself
tolerably
to
his
satisfaction
and
in
a
short
time
he
had
almost
turned
the
tables
and
become
in
their
walks
and
talks
the
accredited
source
of
information
rowland
told
him
that
when
he
turned
direction
miss
galbraith
tremulously
oh
dryly
yes
miss
galbraith
returns
to
her
former
place
with
a
wounded
air
and
for
a
moment
neither
speaks
finally
she
asks
very
meekly
and
there
s
no
danger
from
the
front
mr
richards
coldly
no
miss
galbraith
after
some
little
noises
and
movements
meant
to
catch
mr
richards
s
attention
of
course
i
never
meant
to
imply
that
you
were
intentionally
careless
or
forgetful
mr
richards
still
very
coldly
thank
you
miss
galbraith
i
always
did
justice
to
your
good
heartedness
allen
you
re
perfectly
lovely
that
way
and
i
know
that
you
would
be
sorry
if
you
knew
you
had
wounded
my
feelings
however
accidentally
she
droops
her
head
so
as
to
catch
a
sidelong
glimpse
of
his
face
and
sighs
while
she
nervously
pinches
the
top
of
her
parasol
resting
the
point
on
the
floor
mr
richards
makes
no
answer
that
about
the
cigar
case
might
have
as
you
explain
it
why
it
was
certainly
very
kind
and
very
creditable
to
to
your
thoughtfulness
it
was
thoughtful
mr
richards
i
am
grateful
for
your
good
opinion
miss
galbraith
but
do
you
think
it
was
exactly
it
was
quite
nice
not
to
tell
me
that
your
brother
s
engagement
was
to
be
kept
when
you
know
allen
i
ca
nt
bear
to
blunder
in
such
things
tenderly
do
you
you
ca
n
t
say
it
was
mr
richards
i
never
said
it
was
miss
galbraith
plaintively
no
allen
that
s
what
i
always
admired
in
your
character
you
always
owned
up
do
nt
you
think
it
s
easier
for
men
to
own
up
than
it
is
for
women
mr
richards
i
do
nt
know
i
never
knew
any
woman
to
do
it
miss
galbraith
oh
yes
allen
you
know
i
often
own
up
do
nt
miss
galbraith
oh
how
can
you
bear
to
say
so
when
i
m
rash
or
anything
of
that
kind
you
know
i
acknowledge
it
mr
richards
do
you
acknowledge
it
now
miss
galbraith
why
how
can
i
when
i
have
nt
been
rash
what
have
i
been
rash
mr
richards
about
the
cigar
case
for
example
miss
galbraith
oh
that
that
was
a
great
while
ago
i
thought
you
meant
something
quite
recent
a
sound
as
of
the
approaching
tram
is
heard
in
the
distance
she
gives
a
start
and
then
leaves
her
chair
again
for
one
a
little
nearer
his
i
thought
perhaps
you
meant
about
last
night
mr
richards
well
miss
galbraith
very
judicially
i
do
nt
think
it
was
rash
exactly
no
not
rash
it
might
not
have
been
very
kind
not
to
to
trust
you
anything
but
no
i
took
the
only
course
i
could
nobody
could
have
done
differently
under
the
circumstances
but
if
i
caused
you
any
pain
i
m
very
sorry
oh
yes
very
sorry
indeed
but
i
was
not
precipitate
and
i
know
i
did
right
at
least
i
tried
to
act
for
the
best
do
nt
you
believe
i
did
mr
richards
why
if
you
have
no
doubt
upon
the
subject
my
opinion
is
of
no
consequence
miss
galbraith
yes
but
what
do
you
think
if
you
think
differently
and
can
make
me
see
it
differently
ought
nt
you
to
do
so
mr
richards
i
do
nt
see
why
as
you
say
all
is
over
between
us
miss
galbraith
yes
after
a
pause
i
should
suppose
you
would
care
enough
for
yourself
to
wish
me
to
look
at
the
matter
from
the
right
point
of
view
mr
becoming
more
and
more
uneasy
as
the
noise
of
the
approaching
train
grows
louder
i
think
you
have
been
very
quick
with
me
at
times
quite
as
quick
as
i
could
have
been
with
you
last
night
the
noise
is
more
distinctly
heard
i
m
sure
that
if
i
could
once
see
it
as
you
do
no
one
would
be
more
willing
to
do
anything
in
their
power
to
atone
for
their
rashness
of
course
i
know
that
everything
is
over
mr
richards
as
to
that
i
have
your
word
and
in
view
of
the
fact
perhaps
this
analysis
of
motive
of
character
however
interesting
on
general
grounds
is
a
little
miss
galbraith
with
sudden
violence
say
it
and
take
your
revenge
i
have
put
myself
at
your
feet
and
you
do
right
to
trample
on
me
oh
this
is
what
women
may
expect
when
they
trust
to
men
s
generosity

allen
let
besought
him
to
forsake
his
evil
ways
and
live
in
peace
and
love
with
all
men
she
who
had
warned
him
again
and
again
that
the
way
of
transgressors
is
hard
and
that
though
hand
join
in
hand
the
wicked
shall
not
be
unpunished
she
who
had
loved
cared
for
and
unalterable
tenderness
and
devotion
how
ungrateful
she
would
deem
his
repeated
attempt
against
the
home
and
husband
of
one
whom
she
loved
as
her
own
child
she
would
not
reprove
him
she
would
not
betray
him
but
he
would
know
that
in
her
secret
heart
she
condemned
him
as
a
guilty
wretch
a
disgrace
to
her
and
all
his
relatives
and
that
would
be
worse
far
worse
to
his
proud
spirit
than
the
dreary
loneliness
of
his
present
condition
and
the
lack
of
the
bodily
comforts
she
would
provide
no
he
would
bear
his
bitter
fate
as
best
he
might
and
though
he
had
proved
the
truth
of
her
warning
words
she
should
never
know
it
if
he
could
keep
it
from
her
troops
had
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
the
day
after
the
raid
on
ion
so
to
boyd
s
other
causes
of
distress
was
added
the
constant
fear
of
detection
and
apprehension
this
was
one
reason
why
the
visits
of
his
confreres
were
few
and
short
the
klan
was
said
to
have
disbanded
on
and
search
being
made
for
the

respects
eh
old

but
i

pose
you
prefer

better
to
sit
in

s

with
a
cold
damp
floor
and
a
mouldering

than
to

or
to

the
proudest
palace

fine
sentiment
eh
boyd
the
doctor
was
just
drunk
enough
to
spout

without

whether

fine

not
quite
to

answered

under
the
but
how
am
i
to
get
out
of
this
blind
and
nearly
helpless
as
i
am
well
sir
we
ve
planned
it
all
out
for
you
never
forsake
a
brother
in

you
know
there
s
a
warrant
out
for
bill
dobbs
and
he
has
to
skedaddle
too
he
starts
for
texas
to
night
and
will
take
charge
of
you
savage
went
on
to
give
the
details
of
the
plan
then
left
with
a
promise
to
return
at
night
fall
he
did
so
bringing
dobbs
and
smith
with
him
boyd
s
wounds
were
attended
to
again
dobbs
looking
on
to
learn
the
modus
operandi
then
the
invalid
aided
by
smith
on
one
side
and
dobbs
on
the
other
was
conducted
to
an
opening
in
the
woods
where
a
horse
and
wagon
stood
in
readiness
placed
in
it
dobbs
taking
a
seat
by
his
side
and
supporting
him
with
his
arm
and
driven
a
few
miles
along
an
unfrequented
road
to
a
little
country
station
where
they
took
the
merely
exchanged
glances
with
dobbs
and
seeing
him
apparently
in
search
of
a
pin
in
the
inside
of
his
coat
opened
his
own
and
handed
him
one
then
passed
on
through
the
car
boyd
was
missed
from
the
breakfast
table
at
ashlands
on
the
morning
after
the
raid
upon
ion
his
aunt
sent
a
servant
to
his
room
to
see
if
he
had
overslept
himself
the
man
returned
with
the
report
that
marse
george
was
not
there
and
that
his
bed
had
certainly
not
been
occupied
during
the
night
still
as
his
movements
were
at
all
times
rather
uncertain
and
the
ladies
having
had
no
communication
with
the
oaks
or
ion
on
the
previous
day
were
in
ignorance
of
all
that

transpired
there
his
absence
occasioned
them
no
particular
anxiety
or
alarm
the
meal
went
on
enlivened
by
cheerful
chat

a

from

there
is
a
small
but
very
pleasant
house
just
under
the
hill
where
you
go
down
to
the
stone

leading
over
the

there
is
a
noble
large

on

which

a
beautiful
sweet
and
mellow
kind
of
apple
called

a

many

are
around

and
in
the
little

on
the
side
of

towards
the

house
from
the
road
and
there
is
a
pleasant
path
leading
right
out
from
the
front
door
through
the
garden
down
to
the
water
this
is
the
house
that
georgie
lives
in
one
evening
just
before
sunset
rollo
was
coming
along
over
the
stone
bridge
towards
home
he
stopped
a
moment
to
look
over
the
railing
down
into
the
water
presently
he
heard
a
very
sweet
toned
voice
calling
out
to
him
rol
lo
rollo
looked
along
in
the
direction
in
which
the
sound
came
it
was
from
the
bank
of
the
stream
a
little
way
from
the
road
at
the
place
where
the
path
from
georgie
s
house
came
down
to
the
water
the
brook
was
broad
and
the
water
pretty
smooth
and
still
here
and
it
was
a
place
where
rollo
had
often
been
to
sail
boats
with
georgie
there
was
a
little
smooth
sandy
place
on
the
shore
at
the
foot
of
the
path
and
they
used
to
call
it
georgie
s
landing
and
rollo
thought
it
was
georgie
s
voice
that
called
him
and
in
a
minute
he
saw
him
sitting
on
his
little
seat
with
his
crutches
by
his
side
georgie
was
a
sick
boy
he
could
not
walk
but
had
to
sit
almost
all
day
at
home
in
a
large
easy
chair
which
his
father
had
bought
for
him
in
the
winter
his
chair
was
established
in
a
particular
corner
by
the
side
of
the
fire
and
he
had
a
little
case
of
shelves
and
drawers
painted
green
by
the
side
of
him
in
these
shelves
and
drawers
he
had
his
books
and
playthings
his
pen
and
ink
his
paint
box
brushes
and
pencils
his
knife
and
a
little
saw
and
a
great
many
things
which
he
used
to
make
for
his
amusement
then
in
the
summer
his
chair
and
his
shelves
and
drawers
were
moved
to
the
end
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
garden
and
brook
sometimes
when
he
was
upon
crutches
and
at
such
times
when
it
was
pleasant
he
used
to
go
out
into
the
garden
and
down
through
it
to
his
landing
at
the
brook
georgie
had
been
sick
a
great
many
years
and
when
rollo
and
jonas
first
knew
him
he
used
to
be
very
sad
and
unhappy
it
was
because
the
poor
little
fellow
had
nothing
to
do
his
father
had
to
work
pretty
hard
to
get
food
and
clothing
for
his
family
he
loved
little
georgie
very
much
but
he
could
not
buy
him
many
things
sometimes
people
who
visited
him
used
to
give
him
playthings
and
they
would
amuse
him
a
little
while
but
he
soon
grew
tired
of
them
and
had
them
put
away
it
is
very
hard
for
any
body
to
be
happy
who
has
not
any
thing
to
do
it
was
jonas
that
taught
georgie
what
to
do
he
lent
him
his
knife
and
brought
him
some
smooth
soft
pine
wood
and
taught
him
very
much
and
used
to
sit
by
his
window
in
the
summer
mornings
and
make
playthings
hours
at
a
time
after
he
had
made
several
things
jonas
told
the
boys
that
lived
about
there
that
they
had
better
buy
them
of
him
when
they
had
a
few
cents
to
spend
for
toys
and
they
did
in
fact
they
liked
the
little
windmills
and
wagons
and
small
framed
houses
that
georgie
made
better
than
sugar
plums
and
candy
besides
they
liked
to
go
and
see
georgie
for
whenever
they
went
to
buy
any
thing
of
him
he
looked
so
contented
and
happy
sitting
in
his
easy
chair
with
his
small
and
slender
feet
drawn
up
under
him
and
his
work
on
the
table
by
his
side
then
he
was
a
very
beautiful
boy
too
his
face
was
delicate
and
pale
but
there
was
such
a
kind
and
gentle
expression
in
his
mild
blue
eye
and
so
much
sweetness
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
they
loved
all
the
boys
were
very
fond
of
georgie
georgie
s
money
georgie
at
length
earned
in
this
way
quite
a
little
sum
of
money
it
was
nearly
all
in
cents
but
then
there
was
one
fourpence
which
a
lady
gave
him
for
a
four
wheeled
wagon
that
he
made
he
kept
this
money
in
a
corner
of
his
drawer
and
at
last
there
was
quite
a
handful
of
it
one
summer
evening
when
georgie
s
father
came
home
from
his
work
he
hung
up
his
hat
and
came
and
sat
down
in
georgie
s
corner
by
the
side
of
his
little
boy
georgie
looked
up
to
him
with
a
smile
well
father
said
he
are
you
tired
to
night
you
are
the
one
to
be
tired
georgie
said
he
sitting
here
alone
all
day
hold
up
your
hand
father
said
georgie
reaching
out
his
own
at
the
same
time
which
was
why
what
have
you
got
for
me
said
his
father
hold
fast
all
i
give
you
replied
he
and
he
dropped
the
money
all
into
his
father
s
hand
and
shut
up
his
father
s
fingers
over
it
what
is
all
shore
who
had
stayed
behind
to
engineer
and
direct
the
crossing
placed
it
upon
his
own
gun
dragged
the
indian
into
the
current
of
the
river
and
he
too
floated
down
and
sunk
with
the
first
two
in
the
deep
dark
waters
of
the
susquehanna
he
then
washed
out
all
traces
of
the
bloody
strife
and
bent
his
course
homeward
he
hurried
on
avoiding
the
trodden
path
of
the
red
man
until
he
reached
the
mouth
of
the
otego
creek
when
night
s
sable
curtain
began
to
darken
the
landscape
around
him
he
then
ascended
a
high
peak
of
the
mountain
that
not
only
overlooked
the
valley
of
the
susquehanna
but
also
overlooked
the
lovely
valley
of
the
otego
creek
examining
his
rifle
and
seeing
that
all
was
right
he
laid
down
weary
and
exhausted
to
rest
without
kindling
a
fire
the
experience
of
the
last
two
days
had
taught
him
a
lesson
long
to
be
remembered
as
the
night
grew
dark
and
chilly
he
could
see
the
fire
from
his
own
cottage
window
gleam
warm
and
bright
from
his
lofty
mountain
bed
distant
twelve
miles
the
night
seemed
long
and
wild
and
still
wilder
round
his
lonely
bed
the
war
was
now
raging
between
the
united
states
and
canada
the
inhabitants
of
cherry
valley
had
been
massacred
and
he
had
come
near
losing
his
own
life
and
liberty
and
time
would
only
tell
what
would
become
of
himself
and
family
the
oneidas
knew
his
home
and
place
of
rest
but
at
present
they
were
his
friends
but
how
should
he
escape
these
western
savage
tribes
that
delighted
in
kindling
the
terror
awakening
fire
and
causing
the
midnight
to
glitter
with
the
blaze
of
some
solitary
dwelling
whilst
they
stood
at
the
death
blow
to
the
inmates
and
triumph
with
savage
glee
over
their
untimely
death
such
were
the
reflections
of
mayall
solitary
and
alone
in
his
mountain
bed
when
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
were
in
motion
and
no
human
being
within
twelve
miles
of
his
mountain
camp
at
length
the
morning
dawned
the
sun
arose
in
all
his
glory
throwing
a
rosy
blush
as
it
touched
one
peak
and
then
another
along
the
catskill
mountains
which
he
could
see
clothed
in
all
their
autumnal
glory
above
the
intervening
hills
long
lines
of
clouds
lay
along
the
highest
peaks
of
these
mountains
painted
with
all
the
hues
of
vermilion
and
gold
but
soon
faded
to
a
leaden
hue
as
they
began
to
veil
the
sun
mayall
was
now
aware
of
the
approaching
storm
which
he
considered
a
stroke
of
good
luck
he
took
the
indian
s
rifle
which
he
had
brought
thus
far
with
him
and
secreted
it
in
a
hollow
log
lest
it
might
be
a
tell
tale
of
what
had
practiced
eye
to
see
if
there
was
any
smoke
rising
from
the
valleys
he
could
see
none
but
his
own
in
the
distance
he
then
hurried
down
from
the
mountain
and
took
the
nearest
path
to
his
home
with
rapid
and
hurried
steps
in
order
to
get
as
near
home
as
possible
that
the
rain
might
wash
out
all
traces
behind
and
took
special
care
to
avoid
soft
ground
as
he
well
knew
the
shrewdness
of
the
indians
on
the
track
if
they
should
miss
their
tribesmen
he
reached
home
before
the
rain
began
to
descend
and
had
hardly
closed
the
door
before
the
wind
began
to
blow
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
his
family
were
surprised
to
see
him
return
after
three
days
absence
with
nothing
but
his
gun
and
ammunition
and
appearing
careworn
weary
and
hungry
he
walked
to
the
door
and
looked
out
and
said
nature
weeps
for
me
mayall
was
a
bold
daring
man
and
none
was
found
more
brave
but
wife
he
thought
of
the
three
indian
warriors
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
dark
deep
stream
and
he
wept
thinking
they
might
have
wives
and
fatherless
children
who
would
look
out
evening
and
morning
for
their
fathers
and
husbands
who
would
never
return
again
to
their
homes
his
wife
and
children
hailed
him
with
joy
but
nothing
they
could
say
seemed
worth
his
notice
he
seemed
to
be
wrapped
in
deep
meditation
not
a
smile
was
seen
to
light
up
his
sunburnt
countenance
no
one
could
read
the
secret
of
his
meditation
autumn
quietly
wore
away
and
mayall
confined
his
hunting
excursions
to
his
own
quiet
valley
where
game
appeared
quite
plenty
until
the
snows
of
winter
began
to
whiten
the
hills
he
then
remained
most
of
the
time
at
home
excepting
now
and
then
when
the
weather
was
favorable
he
made
an
excursion
up
or
down
the
valley
in
quest
of
deer
to
supply
his
family
with
fresh
venison
the
deep
snows
had
drifted
over
the
war
path
of
season
spending
most
of
his
time
by
a
warm
winter
fire
at
length
winter
began
to
resign
his
sway
and
took
up
his
march
for
his
northern
icy
throne
the
rays
of
the
sun
began
to
dissolve
the
deep
snow
the
southern
breeze
began
to
whisper
among
the
dumb
branches
of
the
forest
trees
the
warm
rains
pattered
down
the
little
mountain
streams
were
swollen
and
noisily
hurrying
down
to
pour
their
tribute
into
the
otego
which
overflowed
its
banks
and
inundated
the
lowlands
along
the
streams
and
spring
began
to
put
on
her
glorious
robes
of
beauty
the
violet
opened
its
young
leaves
with
all
its
youthful
blush
the
honeysuckle
displayed
its
glistening
cups
of
gold
and
the
forest
trees
were
again
clothed
with
living
green
while
every
tree
that
bore
the
fruits
of
autumn
was
dressed
with
nature
s
fairest
wreaths
which
art
can
scarcely
imitate
the
feathered
choir
had
fluttered
up
the
valley
borne
on
the
southern
breeze
to
cheer
the
woodland
with
their
song
such
was
the
earthly
with
their
artificial
splendor
not
all
the
retinue
of
kings
with
golden
crowns
surrounded
with
warriors
glittering
with
burnished
gold
and
ornamented
with
diamonds
all
these
faded
onto
an
hour
ago
ez
i
was
down
thar
at
the
variety
show
when
the
curtain
was
down
betwixt
the
ax
i
looks
round
fer
daddy
no
daddy
thar
i
goes
out
and
asks
some
o
the
boys
daddy
was
there
a
minnit
ago
they
say
must
hev
gone
home
bein
kinder
responsible
for
the
old
man
i
hangs
around
and
goes
out
in
the
hall
and
sees
a
passage
leadin
behind
boys
ez
that
suthin
in
my
bones
tells
me
the
old
man
is
thar
i
pushes
in
and
sure
as
a
gun
i
hears
his
voice
kinder
pathetic
kinder
pleadin
kinder
love
makin
broke
in
the
impatient
robinson
you
ve
hit
it
pard
you
ve
rung
the
bell
every
time
but
she
says
wants
thet
money
down
or
i
ll
and
here
i
could
nt
get
to
hear
the
rest
and
then
he
kinder
coaxes
and
she
says
sorter
sassy
but
listenin
all
the
time
woman
like
ye
know
eve
and
the
sarpint
and
she
says
i
ll
see
to
morrow
and
he
says
you
wo
nt
blow
on
me
and
i
gets
excited
and
peeps
in
and
may
i
be
teetotally
durned
ef
i
did
nt
see
what
yelled
the
crowd
why
daddy
on
his
knees
to
that
there
fancy
dancer
grace
somerset
round
why
et
s
about
time
she
left
the
cemetery
and
put
in
an
appearance
in
jackson
s
hall
thet
s
all
look
yar
boys
said
robinson
rising
i
do
nt
know
ez
it
s
the
square
thing
to
spile
daddy
s
fun
i
do
nt
object
to
it
provided
she
ai
nt
takin
in
the
old
man
and
givin
him
dead
away
but
ez
we
re
his
guardeens
i
propose
that
we
go
down
thar
and
see
the
lady
and
find
out
ef
her
intentions
is
honorable
if
she
means
marry
and
the
old
man
persists
why
i
reckon
we
kin
give
the
young
couple
a
send
off
thet
wo
nt
disgrace
this
yer
camp
hey
boys
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
proposition
was
received
with
acclamation
and
that
the
crowd
at
once
departed
on
their
discreet
mission
but
the
result
was
never
known
for
the
next
morning
brought
a
shock
to
rough
and
ready
before
which
all
other
interest
found
violated
and
despoiled
the
coffin
opened
and
half
filled
with
the
papers
and
accounts
of
the
robbed
benevolent
associations
but
the
body
of
mammy
was
gone
nor
on
examination
did
it
appear
that
the
sacred
and
ancient
form
of
that
female
had
ever
reposed
in
its
recesses
daddy
downey
was
not
to
be
found
nor
is
it
necessary
to
say
that
the
ingenuous
grace
somerset
was
also
missing
for
three
days
the
reason
of
rough
and
ready
trembled
in
the
balance
no
work
was
done
in
the
ditches
in
the
flume
nor
in
the
mills
groups
of
men
stood
by
the
grave
of
the
lamented
relict
of
daddy
downey
as
open
mouthed
and
vacant
as
that
sepulchre
never
since
the
great
earthquake
of
had
rough
and
ready
been
so
stirred
to
its
deepest
foundations
on
the
third
day
the
sheriff
of
calaveras
a
quiet
gentle
thoughtful
man
arrived
in
town
and
passed
from
one
to
the
other
of
excited
groups
dropping
here
and
there
detached
but
concise
and
practical
information
yes
gentlemen
because
there
was
nt
any
mrs
downey
her
part
was
played
by
george
f
fenwick
of
sydney
a
ticket
of
leave
man
who
was
they
say
a
good
actor
downey
oh
yes
downey
was
jem
flanigan
who
in
used
to
run
the
variety
troupe
in
australia
where
miss
somerset
made
her
debut
stand
back
a
little
boys
steady
the
money
oh
yes
they
ve
got
away
with
that
sure
how
are
ye
joe
why
you
re
looking
well
and
hearty
i
rather
expected
ye
court
week
how
s
things
your
way
then
they
were
only
play
actors
joe
hall
broke
in
a
dozen
voices
i
reckon
returned
the
sheriff
coolly
and
for
a
matter
o
five
blank
years
said
whisky
dick
sadly
they
played
this
camp
jinny
i
think
that
the
few
who
were
permitted
to
know
and
their
days
not
only
in
an
attitude
of
apology
for
having
at
first
failed
to
recognize
her
higher
nature
but
of
remorse
that
they
should
have
ever
lent
a
credulous
ear
to
a
priori
tradition
concerning
her
family
characteristics
she
had
not
escaped
that
calumny
which
she
shared
with
the
rest
of
her
sex
for
those
youthful
follies
levities
and
indiscretions
which
belong
to
immaturity
it
is
very
probable
that
the
firmness
that
distinguished
her
maturer
will
in
youth
might
have
been
taken
for
obstinacy
that
her
nice
discrimination
might
at
the
same
period
have
been
taken
for
adolescent
caprice
and
that
the
positive
expression
of
her
quick
intellect
might
have
been
thought
youthful
impertinence
before
her
years
had
won
respect
for
her
judgment
she
was
foaled
at
indian
creek
and
one
month
later
when
she
was
brought
over
to
sawyer
s
bar
was
considered
the
smallest
donkey
ever
seen
in
the
foot
hills
the
legend
that
she
was
brought
over
in
one
of
dan
the
quartz
crusher
s
boots
required
corroboration
from
that
gentleman
but
his
size
of
his
foot
rather
than
a
desire
to
be
historically
accurate
it
went
for
nothing
it
is
certain
that
for
the
next
two
months
she
occupied
the
cabin
of
dan
until
perhaps
incensed
at
this
and
other
scandals
she
one
night
made
her
way
out
i
had
nt
the
least
idee
wot
woz
comin
said
dan
but
about
midnight
i
seemed
to
hear
hail
onto
the
roof
and
a
shower
of
rocks
and
stones
like
to
a
blast
started
in
the
canyon
when
i
got
up
and
struck
a
light
thar
was
suthin
like
onto
a
cord
o
kindlin
wood
and
splinters
whar
she
d
stood
asleep
and
a
hole
in
the
side
o
the
shanty
and
no
jinny
lookin
at
them
hoofs
o
hern
and
mighty
porty
they
is
to
look
convention
of
the
blackbirds
a
moaning
south
wind
brought
rain
a
southwest
wind
turned
the
rain
to
snow
what
is
called
a
zephyr
out
of
the
west
drifted
the
snow
a
north
wind
sent
the
mercury
far
below
freezing
salt
added
to
snow
increases
the
evaporation
and
the
cold
this
was
the
office
of
the
northeast
wind
it
made
the
snow
damp
and
increased
its
bulk
but
then
it
rained
a
little
and
froze
thawing
at
the
same
time
the
air
was
full
of
fog
and
snow
and
rain
and
then
the
wind
changed
went
back
round
the
circle
reversing
everything
like
dragging
a
cat
by
its
tail
the
mercury
approached
zero
this
was
nothing
uncommon
we
know
all
these
winds
we
are
familiar
with
was
only
the
prologue
the
overture
if
one
might
be
permitted
to
speak
scientifically
it
was
only
the
tuning
of
the
instruments
the
opera
was
to
come
the
flying
dutchman
of
the
air
there
is
a
wind
called
euroclydon
it
would
be
one
of
the
eumenides
only
they
are
women
it
is
half
brother
to
the
gigantic
storm
wind
of
the
equinox
the
euroclydon
is
not
a
wind
it
is
a
monster
its
breath
is
frost
it
has
snow
in
its
hair
it
is
something
terrible
it
peddles
rheumatism
and
plants
consumption
the
euroclydon
knew
just
the
moment
to
strike
into
the
discord
of
the
weather
in
new
england
from
its
lair
about
point
desolation
from
the
glaciers
of
the
greenland
continent
sweeping
round
the
coast
leaving
wrecks
in
its
track
it
marched
right
athwart
the
other
conflicting
winds
churning
them
into
a
fury
and
inaugurating
chaos
it
was
the
marat
of
the
elements
it
was
the
revolution
marching
into
the
dreaded
wood
of
la
one
word
it
was
something
for
which
there
is
no
name
its
track
was
destruction
on
the
sea
it
leaves
wrecks
what
does
it
leave
on
land
funerals
when
it
subsides
new
england
is
prostrate
it
has
left
its
legacy
this
legacy
is
coughs
and
patent
medicines
this
is
an
epic
this
is
destiny
you
think
providence
is
expelled
out
of
new
england
listen
two
days
after
euroclydon
i
found
in
the
woods
the
hepatica
earliest
of
wildwood
flowers
evidently
not
intimidated
by
the
wild
work
of
the
armies
trampling
over
new
england
daring
to
hold
up
its
tender
blossom
one
could
not
but
admire
the
quiet
pertinacity
of
nature
she
had
been
painting
the
grass
under
the
snow
in
spots
it
was
vivid
green
there
was
a
mild
rain
mild
but
chilly
the
clouds
gathered
and
broke
away
in
light
fleecy
masses
there
was
a
softness
on
the
hills
the
birds
suddenly
were
on
every
tree
glancing
through
the
from
their
wings
the
cat
brings
in
one
in
his
mouth
he
thinks
the
season
has
begun
and
the
game
laws
are
off
he
is
fond
of
nature
this
cat
as
we
all
are
he
wants
to
possess
it
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
there
is
a
grand
dress
rehearsal
of
the
birds
not
all
the
pieces
of
the
orchestra
have
arrived
but
there
are
enough
the
grass
sparrow
has
come
this
is
certainly
charming
the
gardener
comes
to
talk
about
seeds
he
uncovers
the
straw
berries
and
the
grape
vines
salts
the
asparagus
bed
and
plants
the
peas
you
ask
if
he
planted
them
with
a
shot
gun
in
the
shade
there
is
still
frost
in
the
ground
nature
in
fact
still
hesitates
puts
forth
one
hepatica
at
a
time
and
waits
to
see
the
result
pushes
up
the
grass
slowly
perhaps
draws
it
in
at
night
this
indecision
we
call
spring
it
becomes
painful
it
is
like
being
on
the
rack
for
ninety
days
expecting
every
however
this
is
the
order
with
man
hope
surprise
bewilderment
disgust
facetiousness
the
people
in
new
england
finally
become
facetious
about
spring
this
is
the
last
stage
it
is
the
most
dangerous
when
a
man
has
come
to
make
a
jest
of
misfortune
he
is
lost
it
bores
me
to
die
said
the
journalist
carra
to
the
headsman
at
the
foot
of
the
guillotine
i
would
like
to
have
seen
the
continuation
one
is
also
interested
to
see
how
spring
is
going
to
turn
out
a
day
of
sun
of
delusive
bird
singing
sight
of
the
mellow
earth
all
these
begin
to
beget
confidence
the
night
even
has
been
warm
but
what
is
this
in
the
morning
journal
at
breakfast
an
area
of
low
pressure
is
moving
from
the
tortugas
north
you
shudder
what
is
this
low
pressure
itself
it
it
is
something
frightful
low
crouching
creeping
advancing
it
is
the
of
the
atmosphere
this
low
pressure
is
a
creation
of
old
prob
what
is
that
old
prob
is
the
new
deity
of
the
americans
greater
than
aeolus
more
despotic
than
sans
culotte
the
wind
is
his
servitor
the
lightning
his
messenger
he
is
a
mystery
made
of
six
parts
electricity
and
one
part
guess
this
deity
is
worshiped
by
the
americans
his
name
is
on
every
man
s
lips
first
in
the
morning
he
is
the
frankenstein
of
modern
science
housed
at
washington
his
business
is
to
direct
the
storms
of
the
whole
country
upon
new
england
and
to
give
notice
in
advance
this
he
does
sometimes
he
sends
the
storm
and
then
gives
notice
this
is
mere
playfulness
on
his
part
it
is
all
one
to
him
his
great
power
is
in
the
low
pressure
on
the
bexar
plains
of
texas
among
the
hills
of
the
presidio
along
the
rio
grande
low
pressure
is
bred
louisiana
it
moves
by
the
way
of
thibodeaux
and
bonnet
carre
the
southwest
is
a
magazine
of
atmospheric
disasters
low
pressure
may
be
no
worse
than
the
others
it
is
better
known
and
is
most
used
to
inspire
terror
it
can
be
summoned
any
time
also
from
the
everglades
of
florida
from
the
morasses
of
the
okeechobee
when
the
new
englander
sees
this
in
his
news
paper
he
knows
what
it
means
he
prone
to
superstition
it
was
not
every
boy
who
would
have
enjoyed
the
sensation
of
spending
his
nights
in
so
isolated
a
situation
for
the
right
wing
was
almost
entirely
unoccupied
on
this
floor
but
archibald
appears
to
have
been
singularly
free
from
fear
whether
of
the
natural
or
of
the
supernatural
he
collected
together
all
his
boyish
penates
his
gun
his
sword
his
fishing
rods
and
his
riding
whips
and
arranged
them
about
the
walls
he
swept
down
doors
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
lumber
that
had
insensibly
collected
there
during
the
last
half
century
lugged
in
a
few
comfortable
broad
bottomed

up

bookshelf
containing
walton

of

arabian
nights
miss
burney
s
evelina
and
other
equally
fashionable
and
ingenious
works
kindled
a
great
fire
on
the
broad
hearth
and
upon
the
whole
rendered
the
aspect
of
things
more
comfortable
than
would
have
been
anticipated
the
room
itself
was
long
narrow
and
comparatively
low
the
latticed
windows
were
sunk
several
feet
into
the
massive
walls
lengths
of
brownish
green
and
yellow
tapestry
none
the
fresher
for
its
two
centuries
and
more
of
existence
still
protested
against
the
modern
heresy
of
wallpaper
and
in
a
panel
frame
over
the
fireplace
was
seen
the
portrait
by
sir
godfrey
kneller
of
the
jacobite
baronet
it
was
a
half
length
in
officer
s
uniform
one
hand
holding
the
hilt
of
a
sword
against
the
breast
as
much
as
to
say
i
vanished
in
that
direction
the
fireplace
it
should
be
noted
was
built
on
the
side
of
the
room
opposite
to
the
windows
that
is
to
say
in
one
of
the
partition
walls
and
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
this
partition
not
the
large
chamber
opening
into
the
corridor
that
lay
at
right
angles
to
the
east
chamber
along
the
southern
front
of
the
wing
not
the
corridor
either
though
it
ran
for
some
distance
parallel
to
the
east
chamber
and
had
a
door
on
the
east
side
but
this
door
led
into
a
great
dark
closet
as
big
as
an
ordinary
room
and
used
as
a
receptacle
for
rubbish
was
it
the
dark
closet
then
that
adjoined
the
east
chamber
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
no
once
more
had
a
window
been
opened
through
the
closet
wall
it
would
have
looked
not
into
archibald
s
room
but
into
a
narrow
blind
court
or
well
entirely
enclosed
between
save
as
a
somewhat
clumsy
architectural
expedient
there
was
no
present
way
of
getting
into
this
well
or
even
of
looking
into
it
unless
one
had
been
at
the
pains
to
mount
on
the
roof
of
the
house
and
peer
down
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
existence
was
only
made
known
by
the
reports
of
an
occasional
workman
engaged
in
renewing
the
tiles
or
mending
a
decayed
chimney
an
accurate
survey
of
the
building
would
of
course
have
revealed
it
at
once
but
nothing
of
the
kind
had
been
thought
of
within
the
memory
of
man
such
a
survey
would
also
have
revealed
what
no
one
in
the
least
suspected
but
which
was
nevertheless
a
fact
of
startling
significance
namely
that
the
blind
court
was
at
least
fifteen
feet
shorter
and
twenty
five
feet
narrower
than
it
ought
to
have
been
archibald
was
as
far
from
suspecting
it
as
anybody
indeed
he
most
likely
never
troubled
his
head
about
builders
plans
in
his
life
but
he
thought
a
it
was
so
placed
as
to
be
in
view
of
the
most
comfortable
chair
before
the
fire
he
spent
many
hours
of
every
week
gazing
at
it
what
was
sir
charles
pointing
at
with
that
left
forefinger
and
what
meant
that
peculiarly
intent
and
slightly
frowning
glance
which
the
painted
eyes
forever
bent
upon
his
own
archibald
probably
had
a
few
of
mrs
radcliffe
s
romances
along
with
the
other
valuable
books
on
his
shelves
and
he
may
have
cherished
a
notion
that
a
treasure
or
an
important
secret
of
some
sort
was
concealed
in
the
vicinity
following
down
the
direction
of
the
pointing
finger
he
found
that
it
intersected
the
floor
at
a
spot
about
five
feet
to
the
right
of
the
side
of
the
fireplace
the
floor
of
the
chamber
was
of
solid
oak
planking
blackened
by
age
and
it
appeared
to
be
no
less
solid
at
this
point
than
at
any
other
nevertheless
he
thought
it
would
be
good
fun
and
at
all
events
would
do
no
harm
to
cut
a
hole
he
quietly
procured
a
saw
and
a
hammer
and
chisel
and
one
day
when
the
family
were
away
from
home
he
locked
himself
into
his
room
and
went
to
work
the
job
was
not
an
easy
one
the
tough
oak
wood
being
almost
enough
to
turn
the
edge
of
his
chisel
and
there
being
no
purchase
at
all
for
the
saw
after
quarter
of
an
hour
s
chipping
and
hammering
with
very
little
result
he
paused
to
rest
the
board
at
which
he
had
been
working
and
which
met
the
wall
at
right
angles
was
very
short
not
more
than
eighteen
inches
long
indeed
being
inserted
merely
to
fill
up
the
gap
caused
by
a
deficiency
in
length
of
the
plank
of
which
it
was
the
continuation
between
the
two
adjoining
ends
was
a
crack
of
some
width
and
into
that
crack
did
archibald
idly
stick
his
chisel
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
crack
widened
so
that
he
was
able
to
press
the
blade
of
the
chisel
down
to
its
forward
and
to
his
delight
the
crack
rapidly
widened
still
further
in
fact
the
short
board
was
sliding
back
underneath
the
wainscot
a
small
oblong
cavity
was
thus
revealed
into
which
the
young
discoverer
glowered
with
beating
heart
and
vast
anticipations
what
he
found
could
scarcely
be
said
to
do
those
anticipations
justice
it
was
neither
a
casket
of
precious
stones
nor
a
document
establishing
the
family
right
of
ownership
of
the
whole
county
of
sussex
it
was
a
small
country
town
was
ablaze
extra
lights
were
glowing
in
all
the
little
shops
yet
all
this
illumination
served
only
to
make
more
apparent
the
untidy
condition
of
the
six
by
nine
window
panes
as
well
as
the
goods
therein
men
and
women
were
hastening
homeward
with
well
filled
baskets
which
they
had
provided
for
the
festive
morrow
all
the
ragged
dirty
urchins
of
the
village
were
gathered
about
the
dingy
shop
windows
admiring
with
distended
eyes
and
gaping
mouths
the
several
displays
of
toys
and
sweetmeats
their
arms
buried
quite
to
their
elbows
in
capacious
but
empty
pockets
they
cast
longing
looks
and
wondered
as
they
had
no
stockings
where
santa
claus
could
put
their
presents
when
he
had
brought
them
to
all
this
show
and
preparation
there
was
one
exception
one
place
shrouded
in
total
darkness
it
was
the
shop
of
nick
baba
the
village
shoemaker
that
was
for
the
time
deserted
left
to
its
dust
its
collection
of
worn
out
soles
its
curtains
of
cobwebs
and
its
compound
of
bad
unwholesome
however
and
give
place
to
a
glimmer
of
light
nick
now
came
hurrying
in
and
quickly
striking
a
light
placed
between
himself
and
a
flickering
oil
lamp
a
small
glass
globe
filled
with
water
he
sat
down
upon
his
bench
and
commenced
work
in
earnest
on
an
unfinished
pair
of
shoes
he
hammered
and
pulled
and
stretched
and
pegged
and
sewed
and
all
this
time
had
there
been
any
one
present
they
might
have
observed
that
though
nick
worked
so
diligently
he
was
unhappy
and
a
prey
to
the
bitterest
reflections
all
in
the
village
had
commenced
their
merry
making
while
he
sat
there
alone
forgotten
and
in
despair
his
neighbors
had
plenty
he
was
penniless
and
could
take
nothing
to
his
home
but
regrets
for
the
past
the
rickety
old
door
now
creaked
on
its
rusty
worn
out
hinges
and
admitted
a
creature
as
strange
looking
as
it
was
unexpected
it
moved
straight
toward
nick
and
perched
itself
upon
a
three
legged
stool
close
beside
him
and
yet
it
was
as
unlike
anything
human
as
is
possible
to
imagine
it
was
more
like
some
fantastic
figure
seen
in
a
dream
the
creation
of
a
disordered
brain
it
may
be
that
it
was
a
goblin
nick
thought
it
one
it
was
only
about
two
feet
high
a
mass
of
dark
brown
hair
streamed
down
its
back
partially
concealing
a
great
hump
and
thence
flowed
down
to
its
heels
its
head
was
round
as
a
ball
and
topped
out
by
a
velvet
cap
of
curious
shape
and
workmanship
with
a
broad
projecting
front
which
shaded
a
pair
of
lustrous
red
eyes
set
far
back
beneath
the
forehead
almost
lost
there
its
breast
was
sunken
and
the
head
settled
down
between
the
shoulders
created
an
impression
of
weakness
as
if
for
example
it
should
speak
that
a
small
piping
voice
would
come
struggling
up
from
below
baba
looked
up
with
alarm
but
the
goblin
greeted
him
with
a
smile
and
said
merry
christmas
nick
in
a
deep
strong
and
from
its
parted
lips
how
do
you
know
my
name
inquired
the
cobbler
and
why
do
you
mock
me
by
such
a
greeting
baba
my
friend
replied
the
goblin
i
was
just
thinking
that
if
all
the
acts
of
your
life
had
been
as
good
and
as
humane
as
your
mechanical
skill
is
perfect
you
would
not
now
be
floundering
in
the
meshes
of
vice
and
dissipation
you
are
making
a
good
pair
of
shoes
there
the
shoemaker
worked
away
without
raising
his
head
but
responded
spitefully
where
is
the
use
of
making
them
good
i
get
no
pay
for
them
why
who
inquired
the
occupant
of
the
three
legged
stool
is
so
ungenerous
as
to
want
such
shoes
without
paying
for
them
they
are
answered
the
busy
workman
for
the
owner
of
this
miserable
shanty
and
he
complains
because
i
am
only
six
months
behind
with
my
rent
a
most
unreasonable
man
if
turn
me
out
i
must
have
some
place
to
work
and
so
am
forced
to
do
the
bidding
of
this
grasping
landlord
ah
it
is
you
who
are
unreasoning
exclaimed
baba
s
visitor
sorrowfully
it
is
you
who
are
in
fault
if
you
would
but
remain
away
from
the
tavern
and
the
vile
associates
whom
you
meet
there
all
would
be
well
with
you
you
might
redeem
yourself
nick
felt
this
rebuke
so
very
keenly
that
he
turned
savagely
toward
the
one
who
had
dared
to
tell
him
so
plainly
of
his
degradation
and
demanded
who
are
you
and
why
have
you
disturbed
the
quiet
of
this
mean
hovel
to
insult
me
in
my
misery
because
i
wish
to
serve
you
answered
it
of
the
waving
brown
hair
you
can
not
serve
me
i
will
drive
you
out
threatened
the
now
infuriated
cobbler
i
will
throw
you
from
the
window
i
will
kill
you
the
red
eyes
of
merry
careless
laugh
came
bubbling
forth
as
it
answered
i
will
not
leave
your
shop
nor
will
you
throw
me
from
the
window
nor
yet
kill
me
nick
baba
why
you
silly
fellow
the
sharpest
tool
on
your
bench
can
not
draw
blood
from
me
and
that
blackened
lapstone
if
driven
with
all
the
force
of
your
great
arm
through
my
seeming
substance
would
leave
me
sitting
here
still
not
to
mock
but
to
try
and
save
you
the
baffled
and
stricken
shoemaker
looked
up
and
muttered
then
you
are
not
human
you
are
a
demon
but
after
all
added
nick
softening
whether
you
are
of
this
world
or
of
some
other
you
are
right
in
what
you
say
the
goblin
made
no
reply
and
nick
continued
i
have
sunk
very
low
indeed
but
i
can
not
shake
this
habit
it
clings
to
me
so
firmly
that
i
have
not
only
forfeited
the
regard
of
why
not
make
an
effort
nick
you
can
if
you
will
yes
yes
responded
nick
it
is
easy
enough
contrary
it
was
generally
kind
and
considerate
of
him
as
such
it
regarded
him
almost
precisely
as
other
people
look
upon
other
species
of
animate
property
except
that
it
conceded
to
him
the
possession
of
human
passions
appetites
and
motives
as
a
farmer
likes
to
turn
a
favorite
horse
into
a
fine
pasture
watch
his
antics
and
see
him
roll
and
feed
and
run
as
he
pats
and
caresses
him
when
he
takes
him
out
and
delights
himself
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
faithful
beast
just
so
the
slave
owner
took
pleasure
in
the
slave
s
comfort
looked
with
approval
upon
his
enjoyment
of
the
domestic
relation
and
desired
to
see
him
sleek
and
hearty
and
that
the
white
regarded
the
black
with
aversion
and
in
that
point
of
view
the
antipathy
was
all
the
more
intensely
bitter
since
he
considered
the
claim
to
manhood
an
intrusion
upon
the
sacred
and
exclusive
rights
of
his
own
race
this
feeling
was
greatly
strengthened
by
the
course
of
legislation
and
legal
construction
both
national
and
state
many
of
the
subtlest
exertions
of
american
intellect
were
those
which
traced
and
defined
the
line
of
demarcation
until
there
was
built
up
between
the
races
considered
as
men
a
wall
of
separation
as
high
as
heaven
and
as
deep
as
hell
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
cite
some
few
examples
of
this
which
will
serve
at
once
to
illustrate
the
feeling
itself
and
to
show
the
steps
in
its
progress
it
was
held
by
our
highest
judicial
tribunal
that
the
phrase
we
the
people
in
the
declaration
of
independence
did
not
include
slaves
who
were
excluded
from
the
inherent
rights
recited
therein
and
accounted
divine
and
inalienable
embracing
of
the
others
as
substantial
premises
the
right
or
privilege
whichever
it
may
be
of
intermarriage
with
the
dominant
race
was
prohibited
to
the
african
in
all
the
states
both
free
and
slave
and
for
all
legal
purposes
that
man
was
accounted
colored
who
had
one
sixteenth
of
african
blood
the
common
law
right
of
self
defence
was
gradually
reduced
by
legal
subtlety
in
the
slave
states
until
only
the
merest
shred
remained
to
the
african
while
the
lightest
word
of
disobedience
or
gesture
of
disrespect
from
him
justified
an
assault
on
the
part
of
the
white
man
early
in
the
present
century
it
was
made
a
crime
in
all
the
states
of
the
south
to
teach
a
slave
to
read
the
free
blacks
were
disfranchised
and
the
most
stringent
restraining
statutes
extended
over
them
including
the
prohibition
of
public
assembly
even
for
divine
worship
unless
a
white
man
were
present
emancipation
was
not
allowed
except
by
decree
of
a
court
of
record
after
tedious
formality
the
master
and
it
was
absolutely
forbidden
to
be
done
by
testament
as
indicative
of
the
fact
that
this
antipathy
was
directed
against
the
colored
man
as
a
free
agent
a
man
solely
may
be
cited
the
well
known
fact
of
the
enormous
admixture
of
the
races
by
illicit
commerce
at
the
south
and
the
further
fact
that
this
was
in
very
large
measure
consequent
upon
the
conduct
of
the
most
refined
and
cultivated
elements
of
southern
life
as
a
thing
an
animal
a
mere
existence
or
as
the
servant
of
his
desire
and
instrument
of
his
advancement
the
southern
caucasian
had
no
antipathy
to
the
colored
race
as
one
to
serve
to
nurse
to
minister
to
his
will
and
pleasure
he
appreciated
and
approved
of
the
african
to
the
utmost
extent
every
exercise
of
manly
right
sentiment
or
inclination
on
the
part
of
the
negro
was
rigorously
repressed
to
attempt
to
escape
was
a
capital
crime
if
repeated
once
or
twice
to
urge
to
read
to
claim
the
rights
of
property
to
speak
insolently
to
meet
for
prayer
without
the
sanction
of
the
white
man
s
presence
were
all
offences
against
the
law
and
in
this
case
as
in
most
others
the
law
was
an
index
as
well
as
the
source
of
a
public
sentiment
which
grew
step
by
step
with
its
progress
in
unconscious
barbarity
perhaps
the
best
possible
indication
of
the
force
of
this
sentiment
in
its
ripened
and
intensest
state
is
afforded
by
the
course
of
the
confederate
government
in
regard
to
the
proposal
that
it
should
arm
the
slaves
in
the
very
crisis
of
the
struggle
when
the
passions
of
the
combatants
were
at
fever
heat
this
proposition
was
made
there
was
no
serious
question
as
to
the
efficiency
or
faithfulness
of
the
slaves
the
masters
did
not
doubt
that
if
armed
with
the
promise
of
freedom
extended
to
them
they
would
prove
most
effective
allies
and
would
secure
to
the
confederacy
that
autonomy
which
few
thoughtful
men
other
means
such
was
the
intensity
of
this
sentiment
however
that
it
was
admitted
to
be
impossible
to
hold
the
southern
soldiery
in
the
field
should
this
measure
be
adopted
so
that
the
confederacy
rather
than
surrender
a
tithe
of
its
prejudice
against
the
negro
as
a
man
rather
than
owe
its
life
to
him
serving
in
the
capacity
of
a
soldier
chose
to
suffer
defeat
and
overthrow
the
african
might
raise
the
food
build
the
breastworks
and
do
aught
of
menial
service
or
mere
manual
labor
required
for
the
support
of
the
confederacy
without
objection
or
demurrer
on
the
part
of
any
but
they
would
rather
surrender
all
that
they
had
fought
so
long
and
so
bravely
to
secure
rather
than
admit
even
by
inference
his
equal
manhood
or
his
fitness
for
the
duty
and
the
danger
of
a
soldier
s
life
it
was
a
grand
stubborness
a
magnificent
adherence
to
an
adopted
and
declared
principle
which
loses
nothing
of
its
grandeur
from
the
fact
that
we
may
believe
the
principle
and
peculiar
illustration
of
this
sentiment
is
the
fact
that
one
of
the
most
earnest
advocates
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
a
type
of
its
southern
opponents
the
author
of
the
impending
crisis
a
book
which
did
more
than
any
other
to
crystallize
and
of
the
wind
from
the
shadowing
maples
sometimes
swelling
into
a
great
depth
of
sound
and
again
dying
to
a
whisper
and
the
effect
seemed
finer
than
that
of
the
most
skilfully
touched
organ
occasionally
an
irascible
bumble
bee
would
dart
in
and
after
a
moment
of
motionless
poise
would
dart
out
again
as
if
in
angry
disdain
of
the
quiet
people
in
its
irate
hum
and
sudden
dartings
i
saw
my
own
irritable
fuming
and
nervous
activity
and
i
blessed
the
friends
and
their
silent
meeting
i
blessed
the
fair
june
face
that
was
as
far
removed
from
the
seething
turmoil
of
i
had
drifted
out
of
the
storm
into
the
very
haven
of
rest
and
peace
and
yet
one
might
justly
dread
lest
the
beauty
which
bound
my
eyes
every
moment
in
a
stronger
fascination
should
evoke
an
unrest
from
which
there
might
be
no
haven
young
men
however
rarely
shrink
from
such
perils
and
i
was
no
more
prudent
than
my
fellows
indeed
i
was
inclining
toward
the
fancy
that
this
june
day
was
the
day
of
destiny
with
me
and
if
such
a
creature
were
the
remedy
for
my
misshapen
life
it
would
be
bliss
to
take
it
in
our
sweet
silence
broken
only
by
the
voice
of
the
wind
the
twitter
of
birds
beguiling
perhaps
with
pretty
nonsense
the
hours
that
would
otherwise
seem
long
to
their
brooding
mates
on
the
nests
and
the
hum
of
insects
my
fancy
began
to
create
a
future
for
the
fair
stranger
a
future
rest
assured
that
did
not
leave
the
dreamer
a
calm
and
disinterested
observer
this
day
i
said
mentally
and
men
are
often
led
like
children
in
the
dark
to
just
the
thing
they
want
the
wisdom
of
solomon
could
not
have
led
me
to
a
place
more
suited
to
my
taste
and
need
than
have
my
blind
aimless
steps
and
before
me
are
possibilities
which
suggest
the
vista
through
which
eve
was
led
to
adam
my
constant
contact
with
men
who
were
keen
self
seeking
and
often
unscrupulous
inclined
me
toward
cynicism
and
suspicion
my
editorial
life
made
me
an
arab
in
a
sense
for
if
there
were
occasion
my
hand
might
be
against
any
man
if
not
every
man
i
certainly
received
many
merciless
blows
and
i
was
learning
to
return
them
with
increasing
zest
my
column
in
the
paper
was
often
a
tilting
ground
and
whether
or
no
i
inflicted
wounds
that
amounted
to
much
i
received
some
that
long
rankled
a
home
such
as
yonder
woman
might
make
would
be
a
better
solace
than
newspaper
files
such
lips
as
these
might
easily
draw
the
poison
from
be
more
genial
than
even
june
sunlight
if
her
eyes
would
reflect
in
into
mine
with
such
companionship
all
the
gradgrinds
in
existence
would
prose
in
vain
life
would
never
lose
its
ideality
nor
the
world
become
a
mere
combination
of
things
her
woman
s
fancy
would
embroider
my
man
s
reason
and
make
it
beautiful
while
not
taking
from
its
strength
idiot
that
i
was
in
imagining
that
i
alone
could
achieve
success
inevitably
i
could
make
but
a
half
success
since
the
finer
feminine
element
would
be
wanting
do
i
wish
men
only
to
read
our
paper
am
i
a
turk
holding
the
doctrine
that
women
have
no
souls
no
minds
the
shade
of
my
mother
forbid
then
how
was
i
a
man
to
interpret
the
world
to
women
truly
i
had
been
an
owl
of
the
night
and
blind
to
the
honest
light
of
truth
when
i
yielded
to
the
counsel
of
ambition
that
i
had
no
time
for
courtship
and
marriage
in
my
subjects
beyond
a
man
s
ken
rather
than
seek
some
such
guide
as
yonder
maiden
whose
intuitions
would
be
unerring
when
the
light
of
reason
failed
in
theory
i
held
the
doctrine
that
there
was
sex
in
mind
as
truly
as
in
the
material
form
now
i
was
inclined
to
act
as
if
my
doctrine
were
true
and
to
seek
to
double
my
power
by
winning
the
supplemental
strength
and
grace
of
a
woman
s
soul
indeed
my
day
dream
was
becoming
exceedingly
thrifty
in
its
character
and
i
assured
ambition
that
the
companionship
of
such
a
woman
as
yonder
maiden
must
be
might
become
the
very
corner
stone
of
success
time
passed
and
still
no
one
was
moved
was
my
presence
the
cause
of
the
spiritual
paralysis
i
think
not
for
i
was
becoming
conscious
of
reverent
feeling
and
deeper
motives
if
the
fair
face
was
my
gospel
message
it
was
already
leading
me
beyond
the
thoughts
of
success
and
ambition
of
mental
power
and
artistic
grace
her
womanly
beauty
began
to
that
looked
as
free
from
guile
as
any
daisy
with
its
eye
turned
to
the
sun
led
me
to
ask
what
right
have
you
to
approach
such
a
creature
think
of
her
needs
of
her
being
first
and
not
your
own
would
you
drag
her
into
the
turmoil
of
your
world
because
she
would
be
a
solace
would
you
disturb
the
maidenly
serenity
of
that
brow
with
knowledge
of
evil
and
misery
the
nightly
record
of
which
you
have
collated
so
long
that
you
are
callous
you
whose
business
it
is
to
look
behind
the
scenes
of
life
will
you
disenchant
her
also
it
is
your
duty
to
unmask
hypocrisy
and
to
drag
hidden
evil
to
light
but
will
you
teach
her
to
suspect
and
distrust
should
you
not
yourself
become
a
better
truer
purer
man
before
you
look
into
the
clear
depths
of
her
blue
eyes
beware
lest
thoughtlessly
or
selfishly
you
sully
their
limpid
truth
if
she
could
be
god
s
evangel
to
me
i
that
is
ever
the
way
suggested
conscience
there
is
always
an
if
in
the
path
of
duty
and
you
make
your
change
for
the
better
depend
on
the
remote
possibility
that
yonder
maiden
will
ever
look
on
you
as
other
than
a
casual
stranger
that
caused
a
slight
disturbance
to
renew
the
national
character
when
it
had
run
to
waste
and
degeneracy
i
have
rejoiced
also
in
the
general
spirit
of
harmony
that
prevailed
throughout
it
for
though
there
might
now
and
then
be
a
few
clashes
of
opinion
between
the
adherents
of
the
cheesemonger
and
the
apothecary
and
an
occasional
feud
between
and
soon
passed
away
the
neighbors
met
with
good
will
parted
with
a
shake
of
the
hand
and
never
abused
each
other
except
behind
their
backs
i
could
give
rare
descriptions
of
snug
junketing
parties
at
which
i
have
been
present
where
we
played
at
all
fours
pope
joan
tome
come
tickle
me
and
other
choice
old
games
and
where
we
sometimes
had
a
good
old
english
country
dance
to
the
tune
of
sir
roger
de
coverley
once
a
year
also
the
neighbors
would
gather
together
and
go
on
a
gypsy
party
to
epping
forest
it
would
have
done
any
man
s
heart
good
to
see
the
merriment
that
took
place
here
as
we
banqueted
on
the
grass
under
the
trees
how
we
made
the
woods
ring
with
bursts
of
laughter
at
the
songs
of
little
wagstaff
and
the
merry
undertaker
after
dinner
too
the
young
folks
would
play
at
blind
man
s
buff
and
hide
and
seek
and
it
was
amusing
to
see
them
tangled
among
the
briers
and
to
hear
a
fine
romping
girl
now
and
then
squeak
from
the
cheesemonger
and
the
apothecary
to
hear
them
talk
politics
for
they
generally
brought
out
a
newspaper
in
their
pockets
to
pass
away
time
in
the
country
they
would
now
and
then
to
be
sure
get
a
little
warm
in
argument
but
their
disputes
were
always
adjusted
by
reference
to
a
worthy
old
umbrella
maker
in
a
double
chin
who
never
exactly
comprehending
the
subject
managed
somehow
or
other
to
decide
in
favor
of
both
parties
all
empires
however
says
some
philosopher
or
historian
are
doomed
to
changes
and
revolutions
luxury
and
innovation
creep
in
factions
arise
and
families
now
and
then
spring
up
whose
ambition
and
intrigues
throw
the
whole
system
into
confusion
thus
in
latter
days
has
the
tranquillity
of
little
britain
been
grievously
disturbed
and
its
golden
simplicity
of
manners
threatened
with
total
subversion
by
the
aspiring
family
of
a
retired
butcher
the
family
of
the
lambs
had
long
been
among
the
most
thriving
and
popular
in
the
neighborhood
the
miss
lambs
were
the
belles
of
little
made
money
enough
to
shut
up
shop
and
put
his
name
on
a
brass
plate
on
his
door
in
an
evil
hour
however
one
of
the
miss
lambs
had
the
honor
of
being
a
lady
in
attendance
on
the
lady
mayoress
at
her
grand
annual
ball
on
which
occasion
she
wore
three
towering
ostrich
feathers
on
her
head
the
family
never
got
over
it
they
were
immediately
smitten
with
a
passion
for
high
life
set
up
a
one
horse
carriage
put
a
bit
of
gold
lace
round
the
errand
boy
s
hat
and
have
been
the
talk
and
detestation
of
the
whole
neighborhood
ever
since
they
could
no
longer
be
induced
to
play
at
pope
joan
or
blindman
s
buff
they
could
endure
no
dances
but
quadrilles
which
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
in
little
britain
and
they
took
to
reading
novels
talking
bad
french
and
playing
upon
the
piano
their
brother
too
who
had
been
articled
to
an
attorney
set
up
for
a
dandy
and
a
critic
characters
hitherto
unknown
in
these
talking
about
kean
the
opera
and
the
edinburgh
review
what
was
still
worse
the
lambs
gave
a
grand
ball
to
which
they
neglected
to
invite
any
of
their
old
neighbors
but
they
had
a
great
deal
of
genteel
company
from
theobald
s
road
red
lion
square
and
other
parts
towards
the
west
there
were
several
beaux
of
their
brother
s
acquaintance
from
gray
s
inn
lane
and
hatton
garden
and
not
less
than
three
aldermen
s
ladies
with
their
daughters
this
was
not
to
be
forgotten
or
forgiven
all
little
britain
was
in
an
uproar
with
the
smacking
of
whips
the
lashing
of
miserable
horses
and
the
rattling
and
the
jingling
of
hackney
coaches
the
gossips
of
the
neighborhood
might
be
seen
popping
their
nightcaps
out
at
every
window
watching
the
crazy
vehicles
rumble
by
and
there
was
a
knot
of
virulent
old
cronies
that
kept
a
lookout
from
a
house
just
opposite
the
retired
butcher
s
and
scanned
and
criticised
every
one
that
knocked
at
the
door
this
dance
whole
neighborhood
declared
they
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
the
lambs
it
is
true
that
mrs
lamb
when
she
had
no
engagements
with
her
quality
acquaintance
would
give
little
humdrum
tea
junketings
to
some
of
her
old
cronies
quite
as
she
would
say
in
a
friendly
way
and
it
is
equally
true
that
her
invitations
were
always
accepted
in
spite
of
all
previous
vows
to
the
contrary
nay
the
good
ladies
would
sit
and
be
delighted
with
the
music
of
the
miss
lambs
who
would
condescend
to
strum
an
irish
melody
for
them
on
the
piano
and
they
would
listen
with
wonderful
interest
to
mrs
lamb
s
anecdotes
of
alderman
plunket
s
family
of
portsokenward
and
the
miss
timberlakes
the
rich
heiresses
of
crutched
friars
but
then
they
relieved
their
consciences
and
averted
the
reproaches
of
their
confederates
by
canvassing
at
the
next
gossiping
convocation
everything
that
had
passed
and
pulling
the
lambs
and
their
rout
all
to
pieces
the
only
one
of
the
family
that
could
honest
lamb
in
spite
of
the
meekness
of
his
name
was
a
rough
hearty
old
fellow
with
the
voice
of
a
lion
a
head
of
black
hair
like
a
shoe
brush
and
a
broad
face
mottled
like
his
own
beef
it
was
in
vain
that
the
daughters
always
spoke
of
him
as
the
old
gentleman
addressed
him
as
papa
in
tones
of
infinite
softness
and
endeavored
to
coax
him
into
a
dressing
gown
and
slippers
and
other
gentlemanly
habits
do
what
they
might
suppose
our
chances
are
getting
less
and
less
yes
said
he
i
reckon
we
d
better
shut
up
shop
before
long
oh
cried
out
the
girl
just
look
at
that
fish
father
father
just
look
at
it
did
any
of
you
catch
it
i
did
nt
see
it
till
this
minute
i
thought
you
had
nt
caught
any
if
i
only
had
a
fishing
line
now
i
would
like
to
catch
just
one
fish
oh
father
why
did
nt
you
bring
a
fishing
line
i
did
nt
think
of
it
my
dear
there
were
any
fish
here
old
menendez
turned
around
and
grinned
at
this
and
i
thought
there
was
a
good
chance
to
stop
fishing
so
i
offered
to
let
the
girl
try
my
line
for
a
while
if
she
wanted
to
it
was
certain
enough
that
she
wanted
to
for
she
was
going
to
run
right
into
the
water
to
get
it
but
i
came
out
and
as
her
father
said
she
might
fish
if
she
did
nt
have
to
walk
into
the
water
old
menendez
took
a
spare
piece
of
line
from
his
pocket
and
tied
it
on
to
the
end
of
mine
and
he
put
on
some
fresh
bait
and
gave
it
a
tremendous
send
out
into
the
surf
then
he
put
the
other
end
around
the
girl
and
tied
it
i
suppose
he
thought
that
it
did
nt
matter
if
a
girl
should
be
lost
but
he
may
have
considered
that
her
father
was
there
to
seize
her
if
she
got
jerked
in
she
took
hold
of
the
line
and
stood
on
the
the
biggest
kind
of
a
fish
that
might
come
along
i
put
on
my
shoes
and
stockings
and
rectus
his
he
d
had
enough
glory
for
one
day
old
menendez
wound
up
his
line
too
but
that
girl
saw
nothing
of
all
this
she
just
kept
her
eyes
and
her
whole
mind
centred
on
her
line
at
first
she
talked
right
straight
ahead
asking
what
she
should
do
when
it
bit
how
big
we
thought
it
would
be
why
we
did
nt
have
a
cork
and
fifty
other
things
but
all
without
turning
her
head
to
the
right
or
the
left
then
said
her
father
my
dear
you
must
nt
talk
you
will
frighten
the
fish
when
persons
fish
they
always
keep
perfectly
quiet
you
never
heard
me
talking
while
i
was
fishing
i
fish
a
good
deal
when
i
am
at
home
said
he
turning
to
us
and
i
always
remain
perfectly
quiet
menendez
laughed
a
little
at
this
there
in
the
surf
would
mind
a
little
quiet
chat
but
the
gentleman
said
that
he
had
always
found
it
best
to
be
just
as
still
as
possible
the
girl
now
shut
her
mouth
tight
and
held
herself
more
ready
if
possible
than
ever
and
i
believe
that
if
she
had
got
a
bite
she
would
have
jerked
the
fish
s
head
off
we
all
stood
around
her
and
her
father
watched
her
as
earnestly
as
if
she
was
about
to
graduate
at
a
normal
school
we
stood
and
waited
and
waited
and
she
did
nt
move
and
neither
did
the
line
menendez
now
said
he
thought
she
might
as
well
give
it
up
the
tide
was
too
low
and
it
was
pretty
near
dinner
time
and
besides
this
there
was
a
shower
coming
on
oh
no
said
she
not
just
yet
i
feel
sure
i
ll
get
a
bite
in
a
minute
or
two
now
just
wait
a
little
longer
and
so
it
waited
about
half
an
hour
and
then
menendez
said
he
must
go
but
if
the
gentleman
wanted
to
buy
the
line
and
stay
there
until
the
tide
came
in
again
he
d
sell
it
to
him
at
this
the
girl
s
father
told
her
that
she
must
stop
and
so
she
very
dolefully
let
menendez
untie
the
line
it
s
too
bad
she
said
almost
with
tears
in
her
eyes
if
they
had
only
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
she
ran
up
to
rectus
and
me
and
said
when
are
you
coming
out
here
again
do
you
think
you
will
come
to
morrow
or
next
day
i
do
nt
know
said
i
we
have
nt
settled
our
plans
for
to
morrow
oh
father
father
she
cried
perhaps
they
will
come
out
here
to
morrow
and
you
must
get
me
a
fishing
line
and
we
will
come
and
fish
all
day
we
did
nt
off
to
our
boat
for
we
were
all
beginning
to
feel
pretty
hungry
we
took
rectus
s
fish
along
to
give
to
our
landlady
the
gentleman
and
the
girl
came
close
after
us
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
be
left
alone
on
the
island
their
boat
was
hauled
up
near
ours
and
we
set
off
at
pretty
much
the
same
time
we
went
ahead
a
little
and
menendez
turned
around
and
called
out
to
the
gentleman
that
he
d
better
follow
us
for
there
were
some
bad
shoals
in
this
part
of
the
harbor
and
the
tide
was
pretty
low
all
right
my
hearty
called
out
the
gentleman
this
is
nt
the
first
time
i
ve
sailed
in
this
harbor
i
guess
i
know
where
the
shoals
are
and
just
at
that
minute
he
ran
his
boat
hard
and
fast
on
one
of
them
he
jumped
up
and
took
an
oar
and
pushed
and
pushed
but
it
was
of
no
good
he
was
stuck
fast
by
but
we
all
had
been
watching
and
rectus
asked
if
we
could
nt
go
back
and
help
him
well
i
s
pose
so
said
menendez
but
it
s
a
shame
to
keep
three
decent
people
out
of
their
dinner
for
the
sake
of
a
man
like
that
who
has
nt
got
sense
enough
to
take
good
advice
when
it
s
give
to
him
we
d
better
go
said
i
and
menendez
in
no
good
humor
put
his
boat
about
we
found
the
other
boat
aground
in
opposite
corner
from
mr
blake
i
was
so
absorbed
in
mind
and
perhaps
i
may
say
shaken
in
nerve
by
the
strain
under
which
i
had
been
laboring
for
some
time
now
that
i
stumbled
up
an
extra
flight
of
stairs
and
without
any
suspicion
of
the
fact
tried
the
door
of
the
room
directly
over
mine
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
now
that
i
could
have
made
the
mistake
for
the
halls
were
totally
dissimilar
the
one
above
being
much
more
cut
up
than
the
one
below
besides
being
flanked
by
a
greater
number
of
doors
but
the
intoxication
of
the
mind
is
not
far
removed
it
was
not
till
i
had
tried
the
door
and
found
it
locked
that
i
became
aware
of
the
mistake
i
had
made
with
the
foolish
sense
of
shame
that
always
overcomes
us
at
the
committal
of
any
such
trivial
error
i
stumbled
hastily
back
when
my
foot
trod
upon
something
that
broke
under
my
weight
i
never
let
even
small
things
pass
without
some
notice
stooping
then
for
what
i
had
thus
inadvertently
crushed
i
carried
it
to
where
a
single
gas
jet
turned
down
very
low
made
a
partial
light
in
the
long
hall
and
examining
it
found
it
to
be
a
piece
of
red
chalk
what
was
there
in
that
simple
fact
to
make
me
start
and
hastily
recall
one
or
two
half
forgotten
incidents
which
once
brought
to
mind
awoke
a
train
of
thought
that
led
to
the
discovery
and
capture
of
those
two
desperate
thieves
i
will
tell
you
i
do
nt
remember
now
whether
in
my
account
of
the
visit
i
paid
to
the
schoenmakers
house
in
vermont
scrawled
on
the
panel
of
one
of
the
doors
it
seemed
a
trivial
thing
at
the
time
and
made
little
or
no
impression
upon
me
the
chances
being
that
i
should
never
have
thought
of
it
again
if
i
had
not
come
upon
the
article
just
mentioned
at
a
moment
when
my
mind
was
full
of
those
very
schoenmakers
but
remembered
now
together
with
another
half
forgotten
fact
that
some
days
previous
i
had
been
told
by
the
woman
who
kept
the
house
i
was
in
that
the
parties
over
my
head
two
men
and
a
woman
i
believe
she
said
were
giving
her
some
trouble
but
that
they
paid
well
and
therefore
she
did
not
like
to
turn
them
out
it
aroused
a
vague
suspicion
in
my
mind
and
led
to
my
walking
back
to
the
door
i
had
endeavored
to
open
in
my
abstraction
and
carefully
looking
at
it
it
was
plain
and
white
rather
ruder
of
make
than
those
below
but
offering
no
inducements
for
prolonged
scrutiny
but
not
so
with
the
left
full
in
the
centre
of
that
i
beheld
distinctly
scrawled
probably
with
the
very
piece
of
chalk
i
then
held
a
red
cross
precisely
similar
in
outline
to
the
one
i
had
seen
a
few
days
before
on
the
panel
of
the
schoenmakers
door
at
granby
the
discovery
sent
a
thrill
over
me
that
almost
raised
my
hair
on
end
was
then
this
famous
trio
to
be
found
in
the
very
house
in
which
i
had
been
myself
living
for
a
week
or
more
over
my
head
in
fact
i
could
not
withdraw
my
gaze
from
the
mysterious
looking
object
i
bent
near
i
listened
i
heard
what
sounded
like
the
suppressed
snore
of
a
powerful
man
and
almost
had
to
lay
hold
of
myself
to
prevent
my
hand
from
pushing
open
that
closed
door
and
my
feet
from
entering
as
it
was
i
did
finger
the
knob
a
little
but
an
extra
loud
snore
from
within
reminded
me
by
its
suggestion
of
strength
that
i
was
but
a
small
man
and
that
the
better
part
of
valor
i
therefore
withdrew
but
for
the
whole
night
lay
awake
listening
to
catch
any
sounds
that
might
come
from
above
and
going
so
far
as
to
plan
what
i
would
do
if
it
should
be
proved
that
i
was
indeed
upon
the
trail
of
the
men
i
was
so
anxious
to
encounter
with
the
breaking
of
day
i
was
upon
my
feet
a
rude
step
had
gone
up
the
stairs
a
few
minutes
before
and
i
was
all
alert
to
follow
but
i
presently
considered
that
my
wisest
course
would
be
to
sound
the
landlady
and
learn
if
possible
with
what
sort
of
characters
i
had
to
deal
routing
her
out
of
the
kitchen
where
at
that
early
hour
she
was
already
engaged
in
domestic
duties
i
drew
her
into
a
retired
corner
and
put
my
questions
she
was
not
backward
in
replying
she
had
conceived
an
innocent
liking
for
me
in
the
short
time
i
had
been
with
her
a
display
of
weakness
for
which
i
was
myself
perhaps
as
much
to
blame
griefs
into
my
sympathizing
ear
for
those
men
were
a
grief
to
her
acceptable
as
was
the
money
they
were
careful
to
provide
her
with
they
were
not
only
always
in
the
house
that
is
one
of
them
smoking
his
old
pipe
and
blackening
up
the
walls
but
they
looked
so
shabby
and
kept
the
girl
so
close
and
if
they
did
go
out
came
in
at
such
unheard
of
hours
it
was
enough
to
drive
her
crazy
yet
the
money
the
money
yes
said
i
i
know
and
the
money
ought
to
make
you
overlook
all
the
small
disagreeablenesses
you
mention
what
is
a
landlady
without
patience
and
i
urged
her
not
to
turn
them
out
but
the
girl
she
went
on
so
nice
so
quiet
so
sick
looking
i
can
not
stand
it
to
see
her
cooped
up
in
that
small
room
always
watched
over
by
one
or
both
of
those
burly
wretches
the
old
man
says
she
but
i
would
as
soon
think
of
that
little
rosy
child
you
see
cooing
in
the
window
over
the
way
belonging
to
the
beggar
going
in
at
the
gate
as
because
it
is
every
word
true
the
legend
of
the
salt
sea
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
by
the
great
sea
two
brothers
named
klaus
and
koerg
the
elder
inheriting
the
rich
estates
of
his
ancestors
the
younger
a
woodchopper
and
so
poor
that
it
was
ofttimes
a
difficult
task
for
him
to
provide
bread
for
his
wife
and
little
children
hard
as
life
often
seems
it
when
nigh
on
to
one
merry
christmas
tide
an
accident
deprived
him
of
his
strong
right
hand
thereby
cutting
off
forever
his
slender
means
of
livelihood
there
was
but
one
resource
and
with
crushed
spirit
koerg
betook
himself
to
his
elder
brother
to
crave
some
mercy
for
his
starving
babes
klaus
was
a
harsh
man
with
love
only
for
his
yellow
gold
he
frowned
impatiently
when
koerg
interrupted
his
selfish
dreams
and
for
answer
to
his
pitiful
story
threw
him
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
pudding
bidding
him
begone
and
be
satisfied
and
koerg
went
forth
with
a
heavy
heart
his
faint
hope
dead
his
homeward
path
followed
the
raging
sea
the
night
was
dark
and
stormy
the
waves
bellowed
and
lashed
at
the
shore
like
an
army
of
infuriated
beasts
but
koerg
heeded
it
not
only
clutched
his
bread
and
pudding
and
walked
on
with
a
white
despairing
face
suddenly
as
he
emerged
from
a
thick
bit
of
woods
he
became
conscious
of
a
strange
light
phenomenon
he
beheld
a
little
old
man
snow
haired
and
bearded
standing
plump
in
the
path
before
him
you
seem
in
trouble
friend
he
ejaculated
with
a
chuckle
something
twists
in
your
world
i
trow
koerg
was
not
slow
to
recognize
a
geist
his
knees
shook
and
he
dared
not
utter
a
word
the
elf
looked
down
upon
him
half
displeased
yet
chuckling
merrily
withal
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
he
continued
sweetly
i
am
the
guardian
of
the
honest
poor
this
night
i
come
to
reveal
to
you
a
secret
which
rightly
used
will
bestow
upon
you
riches
life
lasting
and
unlimited
koerg
bewildered
could
not
yet
yield
simple
faith
he
clutched
desperately
his
bread
and
pudding
he
found
no
joyful
words
the
little
man
frowned
scathingly
on
the
gift
of
klaus
then
burst
into
a
scornful
laugh
illustration
the
wonder
mill
grinds
it
is
always
thus
friend
even
at
the
full
but
care
not
since
this
meagre
chip
will
prove
to
you
a
barter
for
millions
follow
me
the
great
estates
to
klaus
the
treasures
of
the
sea
koerg
shall
know
to
night
and
with
a
hand
wave
the
elf
led
the
way
over
the
rough
cliffs
koerg
mutely
following
illustration
the
geist
he
paused
at
the
base
of
a
hillock
shaped
like
a
horseshoe
a
spot
which
koerg
knew
well
a
place
of
rocks
reefs
and
general
ill
report
the
time
is
favorable
muttered
the
little
man
my
children
are
hungry
to
night
and
turning
to
koerg
he
continued
take
the
gift
of
klaus
and
go
down
into
the
sea
a
crowd
will
swarm
upon
you
as
persistent
and
voracious
as
any
in
this
upper
world
ask
for
the
wonder
mill
and
sacrifice
your
treasures
only
in
its
exchange
i
will
await
you
here
a
spell
immediately
enwrapped
the
senses
of
koerg
calm
and
fearless
to
the
glittering
caves
from
whence
exactly
as
the
elf
had
depicted
swarmed
forth
troops
of
mermen
and
mermaids
with
eyes
and
arms
voraciously
extended
towards
the
bread
and
the
pudding
he
held
tightly
clutched
to
his
breast
but
koerg
spurred
on
by
the
elf
resisted
them
all
nor
parted
with
a
single
crumb
till
the
wonder
mill
lay
safe
in
his
embrace
the
little
man
stood
waiting
on
the
brink
i
dedicate
this
to
the
honest
poor
he
said
softly
yes
koerg
it
is
yours
ask
of
it
what
you
will
and
it
shall
never
fail
you
gold
silver
hundreds
of
loaves
and
puddings
but
and
here
the
little
man
paused
a
shudder
quivered
through
his
frame
and
he
continued
solemnly
remember
that
by
no
hand
but
yours
can
it
be
controlled
guard
it
carefully
for
the
day
you
part
with
it
your
portion
shall
be
ashes
and
mine
annihilation
when
koerg
dared
lift
his
eyes
the
elf
had
weeping
she
knew
well
the
heart
of
her
brother
klaus
and
how
vain
would
be
koerg
s
last
effort
to
save
them
from
starvation
a
step
sounded
on
the
path
without
rahel
and
the
babes
stopped
to
listen
it
was
not
dull
and
heavy
as
they
had
expected
but
blithe
as
the
jingle
of
sleigh
bells
and
in
a
second
koerg
burst
in
upon
them
dimpling
all
over
with
merry
laughter
rahel
regarded
him
amazed
you
bring
no
bread
to
our
starving
babes
and
yet
you
laugh
she
said
oh
koerg
koerg
trouble
has
made
you
mad
still
chuckling
he
slipped
the
wonder
mill
from
beneath
his
coat
and
said
softly
hush
rahel
a
geist
has
been
with
me
to
night
i
have
brought
endless
fortune
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
plump
in
the
eyes
of
his
astonished
wife
he
began
turning
out
loaves
and
puddings
with
such
a
gusto
that
the
room
was
soon
filled
and
from
that
night
just
as
the
little
man
had
said
riches
unlimited
came
to
the
house
of
koerg
no
treasure
too
great
for
the
mill
to
produce
and
though
the
woodchopper
strove
hard
at
secrecy
its
fame
spread
far
and
wide
from
the
mountains
back
to
the
sea
and
folks
flocked
by
thousands
to
view
the
magic
engine
that
koerg
had
fished
up
from
the
the
ocean
s
depths
and
though
always
good
humoredly
he
tested
its
powers
and
loaded
his
guests
with
princely
gifts
yet
he
rested
night
after
night
more
uneasily
upon
his
pillow
remembering
the
solemn
words
of
the
geist
the
day
you
part
with
it
your
portion
shall
be
ashes
and
mine
annihilation
one
day
after
the
space
of
a
year
there
came
to
the
woodchopper
s
door
a
captain
from
when
he
was
a
boy
and
the
limb
had
to
be
amputated
and
its
place
was
supplied
with
a
wooden
peg
there
were
three
or
four
other
bobs
on
the
plantation
and
he
was
called
snake
bit
to
distinguish
him
though
lame
and
sick
a
good
deal
of
his
time
his
life
had
not
been
wasted
nor
had
he
been
a
useless
slave
to
were
used
in
the
cotton
picking
season
and
had
learned
to
mend
shoes
besides
that
he
was
the
great
horse
doctor
of
the
neighborhood
and
not
only
cured
his
master
s
horses
and
mules
but
was
sent
for
for
miles
around
to
see
the
sick
stock
and
then
too
he
could
re
bottom
chairs
and
make
buckets
and
tubs
and
brooms
and
all
of
the
money
he
made
was
his
own
so
the
old
man
had
quite
a
little
store
of
gold
and
silver
sewed
up
in
an
old
bag
and
buried
somewhere
nobody
knew
where
except
himself
for
uncle
snake
bit
bob
had
never
married
and
had
no
family
ties
and
furthermore
he
was
old
granny
rachel
s
only

ever

the

mother
was
a
baby
and
he
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
so
having
no
cause
to
spend
his
money
he
had
laid
it
up
until
now
he
was
a
miser
and
would
steal
out
by
himself
at
night
and
with
great
delight

he
was
a
very

after
this
exhortation
the
old
man
began
at
the
top
of
the
line
and
asked
made

i
dun
no
sar
answered
gus
very
untruthfully
for
aunt
nancy
had
told
him
repeatedly

said
uncle
bob
now
who
made
yer
god
answered
gus
dat
s
right
said
the
old
man
then
proceeded
to
jim
the
next
in
order
what
d
he
make

outn
demanded
the
teacher
i
du
n
no

answered
jim
with
as
little
regard
for

as
gus
had
shown
he

out

said
uncle
bob
now
what
d
he
make
yer
out
n
dut
answered
jim
promptly
and
the
old
man
passed
on
to
the
next
what
d
he
make
yer
fur
again
the
answer
was
i
du
n
no
sar
and
the
old
man
after
scratching
his
head
and
reflecting
a
moment
said
which
the
child
repeated
after
him
who
wuz
de
fus
man
was
his
next
question
and
the
little
nig
professing
ignorance
as
usual
the
old
man
replied
marse
adum
and
so
he
went
all
down
the
line
explaining
that
marse
cain
kilt
his
brudder
that
marse
abel
wuz
de

man
slewed
that

that
marse
thuselum
wuz
de

man
and
so
on
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
line
and
had
almost
exhausted
his
store
of
information
then
thinking
to
see
how
much
the
children
remembered
he
began
at
the
top
of
the
line
once
more
and
asked
the
child
who
made
yer
dut
answered
the
little
negro
who
demanded
uncle
bob
in
astonishment
dut
replied
the
child
didn
i
tell
yer
god

yer
asked
the
old
man
dat
n
wat
god
made
done
slip
out
de
do
was
the
distance
by
the
sea
is
much
the
shortest
would
you
be
willing
to
go
in
that
way
asked
the
old
man
certainly
said
the
prince
provided
i
have
to
go
over
gentleman
made
no
reply
to
this
but
putting
his
two
forefingers
in
his
mouth
he
whistled
loudly
in
a
few
moments
a
sea
boy
came
up
out
of
the
water
and
stood
beside
him
the
old
man
made
a
few
remarks
to
him
in
the
ocean
dialect
when
the
boy
jumped
off
the
rock
and
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
now
sir
said
the
sea
gentleman
to
the
prince
you
must
cheer
up
and
be
lively
or
you
can
not
hope
to
succeed
in
this
matter
my
boy
will
take
you
to
the
sea
side
entrance
of
the
cave
of
mahbracca
there
i
hope
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
entering
but
i
can
say
nothing
positive
upon
the
subject
at
this
moment
the
sea
boy
reappeared
driving
a
pair
of
dolphins
which
were
harnessed
to
a
large
and
commodious
sea
shell
somewhat
resembling
in
shape
the
boat
of
the
nautilus
when
the
equipage
was
drawn
up
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
the
prince
took
leave
of
his
friends
and
quickly
stepped
all
success
said
the
elderly
personage
and
reminding
the
boy
to
be
sure
to
keep
their
heads
up
he
walked
down
into
the
sea
the
water
woman
said
nothing
but
stood
on
the
rock
gazing
sadly
after
the
prince
as
the
dolphins
drew
him
rapidly
from
the
shore
the
fishes
made
excellent
time
and
the
motion
of
the
great
shell
over
the
waves
would
have
been
exceedingly
pleasant
to
the
prince
if
his
mind
had
not
been
filled
with
anxiety
and
impatience
he
shifted
his
position
so
often
and
rolled
the
vehicle
about
so
much
that
once
or
twice
the
sea
boy
turned
round
and
asked
him
if
he
did
not
wish
to
get
out
to
which
the
prince
did
not
reply
but
only
urged
him
to
make
greater
speed
the
journey
lasted
until
the
morning
of
the
next
day
and
was
marked
by
no
greater
occurrence
than
the
annoyance
caused
by
the
wild
dolphins
occasionally
coming
up
around
them
endeavoring
to
play
with
their
brothers
in
harness
but
the
boy
prince
with
his
sword
soon
drove
them
down
again
at
last
they
dashed
into
shore
and
the
sea
boy
pulling
up
his
steeds
jumped
out
followed
immediately
by
the
prince
take
the
road
in
front
of
you
said
the
boy
and
you
can
not
miss
your
way
the
prince
then
threw
a
piece
of
platinum
to
the
boy
who
tucked
it
in
between
two
of
his
scales
and
jumping
into
his
shell
drove
rapidly
away
illustration
the
shore
where
the
prince
now
found
himself
was
very
peculiar
a
high
rocky
wall
seemingly
inaccessible
stood
up
solemnly
in
front
of
him
and
extended
out
on
each
side
far
into
the
sea
directly
before
him
was
a
great
cleft
or
tunnel
in
the
rock
which
extended
so
far
back
that
its
other
extremity
was
not
visible
from
where
he
stood
this
rocky
avenue
was
the
only
passage
in
any
direction
that
the
prince
could
perceive
and
consequently
without
delay
or
fear
he
for
a
while
was
easy
but
afterward
became
very
rough
and
uneven
here
and
there
were
openings
in
the
walls
above
him
through
which
came
a
misty
light
and
by
it
the
prince
perceived
that
the
walls
were
filled
with
precious
stones
which
glistened
and
sparkled
brightly
while
great
veins
of
gold
and
silver
were
streaked
about
in
all
directions
under
his
feet
were
thousands
of
jewels
and
bits
of
precious
minerals
without
number
his
way
was
now
very
difficult
for
the
avenue
was
narrow
and
rough
pearls
and
sapphires
got
into
his
shoes
and
he
cut
his
legs
and
scratched
his
hands
against
the
sharp
diamonds
and
rubies
that
stuck
out
from
the
walls
but
he
pressed
bravely
on
until
the
ground
became
more
even
and
the
walls
wider
apart
and
at
length
he
entered
quite
an
open
space
inclosed
by
a
wall
in
which
he
saw
before
him
an
immense
gate
of
copper
he
went
up
and
tried
to
push
it
open
but
finding
it
immovable
he
knocked
loudly
upon
it
small
window
at
one
side
of
the
gate
was
opened
and
a
ghoul
put
his
head
out
seeing
that
it
was
a
prince
who
knocked
he
drew
in
his
head
and
opened
the
gate
the
prince
quickly
entered
i
wish
said
he
in
an
imperious
voice
to
see
the
princess
whom
the
wicked
mahbracca
has
doubtless
imprisoned
in
this
cavern
o
said
the
ghoul
grinning
horribly
certainly
pass
on
great
prince
the
princess
and
my
mistress
will
both
be
glad
to
see
you
pass
on
freely
you
can
not
miss
your
way
opening
then
his
wide
mouth
he
gave
a
great
laugh
and
reentered
the
porter
s
lodge
through
the
open
door
of
which
the
prince
saw
upon
a
table
an
empty
coffin
and
a
jug
the
prince
now
found
himself
in
a
long
and
wide
passage
dimly
lighted
and
very
damp
the
place
smelt
like
a
burial
vault
and
against
the
walls
on
each
their
knees
drawn
up
to
their
chins
as
the
prince
passed
some
of
them
jumped
up
and
gibed
at
him
leering
sticking
out
their
tongues
and
smacking
their
lips
as
they
danced
around
him
walking
on
rapidly
he
soon
left
these
gibbering
wretches
and
found
that
the
passage
became
much
drier
although
darker
and
wound
and
turned
in
various
directions
against
the
walls
transfixed
by
great
iron
pins
were
enormous
glow
worms
which
gave
the
only
light
in
this
dismal
place
these
worms
turned
their
heads
to
look
at
the
prince
and
flashed
a
brighter
light
from
their
tails
that
they
might
see
him
the
better
presently
he
noticed
a
small
door
in
the
wall
which
was
not
quite
closed
pushing
it
open
he
entered
a
room
the
floor
of
which
was
not
very
spacious
but
go
by
we
can
stand
those
things
here
on
earth
but
when
we
get
over
there
we
must
have
a
square
deal
or
jump
the
game
tragedy
on
the
stage
the
tendency
of
the
stage
is
to
present
practical
everyday
affairs
in
plays
and
those
are
the
most
successful
which
are
the
most
natural
the
shoeing
of
a
horse
on
the
stage
in
a
play
attracts
the
attention
of
the
audience
wonderfully
and
draws
well
the
inner
workings
of
a
brewery
or
a
mill
is
a
big
card
but
there
is
hardly
enough
tragedy
about
it
if
they
could
run
a
man
or
two
through
the
wheel
and
have
them
cut
up
into
hash
or
have
them
crowned
in
a
beer
vat
audiences
could
applaud
as
they
do
when
eight
or
nine
persons
are
stabbed
poisoned
or
beheaded
in
the
on
top
of
each
other
what
the
people
want
is
a
compromise
between
old
tragedy
and
new
comedy
now
if
some
manager
could
have
a
love
play
where
the
heroine
goes
into
a
slaughter
house
to
talk
love
to
the
butcher
instead
of
a
blacksmith
shop
or
a
brewery
it
would
take
a
scene
could
be
set
for
a
slaughter
house
with
all
the
paraphernalia
for
killing
cattle
and
supe
butchers
to
stand
around
the
star
butcher
with
cleavers
and
knives
the
star
butcher
could
sit
on
a
barrel
of
pigs
feet
or
a
pile
of
heads
and
horns
and
soliloquize
over
his
unrequited
love
as
he
sharpened
a
butcher
knife
on
his
boot
the
hour
for
slaughtering
having
arrived
cattle
could
be
driven
upon
the
stage
the
star
could
knock
down
a
steer
and
cut
its
throat
and
hang
it
up
by
the
hind
legs
and
skin
it
with
the
audience
looking
on
breathlessly
as
he
was
about
to
cut
open
the
body
of
the
dead
animal
the
orchestra
waltz
out
from
behind
a
lot
of
dried
meat
hanging
up
at
one
side
dressed
in
a
lavender
satin
princess
dress
en
train
with
a
white
reception
hat
with
ostrich
feathers
and
wading
through
the
blood
of
the
steer
on
the
carpet
shout
stay
your
hand
reginald
the
star
butcher
could
stop
wipe
his
knife
on
his
apron
motion
to
the
supe
butchers
to
leave
and
he
would
take
three
strides
through
the
blood
and
hair
to
the
side
of
the
heroine
take
her
by
the
wrist
with
his
bloody
hand
and
shout
what
wiltest
thou
mary
anderson
de
montmorence
then
they
could
sit
down
on
a
box
of
intestines
and
liver
and
things
and
talk
it
over
and
the
curtain
could
go
down
with
the
heroine
swooning
in
the
arms
of
the
butcher
seven
years
could
elapse
between
that
act
and
the
next
and
a
scene
could
be
laid
in
a
boarding
house
and
some
of
the
same
beef
could
be
on
the
table
desire
to
go
into
details
we
are
no
play
writer
but
we
know
what
takes
people
have
got
tired
of
imitation
blood
on
the
stage
they
kick
on
seeing
a
man
killed
in
one
act
and
come
out
as
good
as
new
in
the
next
any
good
play
writer
can
take
the
cue
from
this
article
and
give
the
country
a
play
that
will
take
the
biscuit
imagine
john
mccullough
or
barrett
instead
of
killing
roman
supes
with
night
gowns
on
and
bare
legs
killing
a
texas
steer
there
s
where
you
would
get
the
worth
of
your
money
it
would
make
them
show
the
metal
within
them
and
they
would
have
to
dance
around
to
keep
from
getting
a
horn
in
their
trousers
it
does
not
require
any
pluck
to
go
out
behind
the
scenes
with
a
sword
and
kill
enough
supes
for
a
mess
give
us
some
slaughter
house
tragedy
right
away
the
mistake
about
it
there
is
nothing
that
is
more
touching
than
the
gallantry
of
men
total
accident
any
man
who
has
a
heart
in
him
who
sees
a
lady
whose
apparel
has
become
disarranged
in
such
a
manner
that
she
can
not
see
it
will
though
she
be
a
total
stranger
tell
her
of
her
misfortune
so
she
can
fix
up
and
not
be
stared
at
but
sometimes
these
efforts
to
do
a
kindly
action
are
not
appreciated
and
men
get
fooled
this
was
illustrated
at
watertown
last
week
people
have
no
doubt
noticed
that
one
of
the
late
fashions
among
women
is
to
wear
at
the
bottom
of
the
dress
a
strip
of
red
which
goes
clear
around
to
the
initiated
it
looks
real
nice
but
a
man
who
is
not
posted
in
the
fashions
would
swear
that
the
woman
s
petticoat
was
dropping
off
and
if
she
was
not
notified
and
allowed
to
fix
it
she
would
soon
be
in
a
terrible
fix
on
the
street
it
was
a
week
ago
monday
that
a
lady
from
oshkosh
was
at
watertown
on
a
visit
and
she
wore
a
as
she
walked
across
the
bridge
mr
calvin
cheeney
a
gentleman
whose
heart
is
in
the
right
place
saw
what
he
supposed
would
soon
be
a
terrible
accident
which
would
tend
to
embarrass
the
lady
so
he
stepped
up
to
her
in
the
politest
manner
possible
took
off

excuse
me
madame

you
might
step
right

he
pointed
to
the

she
gave
him
a
look
which

out

it

the
last
time
he

ever
try
to
help
a
woman
in

sailed
along
down
to
a
grocery
store

stopped
to
look
at
some
grapes

the
practiced
eye
of

peter

that
something
was

at

miss
your

how
has
it
been
since
we
drank
that
last
kiss
that
was
bitter
with
lees
of
the
wasted
wine
when
the
tattered
remains
of
a
threadbare
bliss
and
the
worn
out
shreds
of
a
joy
divine
with
a

you

we
cast
away
and
find
no

in

silken
threads
of

you
thought

of

last
kiss
better
than

what
idle
queries

yes

no
whatever
your
answer
i
understand
that
there
is
no
pathway
by
which
coarse
roller
towel
which
hung
behind
the
door
entered
the
room
and
saluting
the
detective
familiarly
proceeded
to
comb
his
hair
before
a
cracked
mirror
that
hung
behind
the
desk
after
he
had
hastily
finished
this
operation
he
turned
again
to
manning
who
had
been
smilingly
observing
his
movements
have
you
had
breakfast
sir
last
table
just
ready
thank
you
replied
manning
i
have
already
had
my
breakfast
i
am
looking
for
a
man
who
is
stopping
here
by
the
name
of
king
what
s
his
first
name
bob
yes
that
s
his
name
he
is
a
brakeman
on
the
road
oh
yes
bob
s
here
he
s
eating
his
breakfast
now
just
sit
down
he
ll
be
here
directly
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
a
tall
broad
shouldered
young
man
of
rather
good
natured
and
intelligent
appearance
entered
the
hooks
upon
the
wall
placed
it
upon
his
head
it
did
not
require
the
rather
officious
indication
of
the
young
clerk
to
induce
the
detective
to
recognize
the
new
comer
as
the
man
whom
he
was
most
desirous
of
seeing
his
appearance
tallied
precisely
with
the
description
of
him
which
he
had
previously
obtained
stepping
quietly
up
to
the
young
man
the
detective
said
carelessly
your
name
is
bob
king
i
believe
somewhat
confused
by
the
abrupt
salutation
the
young
fellow
replied
rather
awkwardly
yes
that
s
my
name
but
you
ve
got
the
brakes
on
me
for
i
do
nt
remember
that
i
ever
saw
you
before
perhaps
not
answered
manning
but
i
want
to
have
a
little
private
conversation
with
you
for
a
few
minutes
can
we
go
somewhere
where
we
will
not
be
interrupted
why
yes
responded
the
other
still
evidently
ill
at
ease
come
in
here
and
turning
about
and
entered
a
small
and
plainly
furnished
sitting
room
wait
said
manning
as
if
suddenly
conceiving
an
idea
the
morning
is
pleasant
and
i
have
a
good
cigar
here
suppose
we
take
a
short
walk
together
we
can
talk
as
we
stroll
along
all
right
said
king
as
he
took
the
proffered
cigar
and
lighting
it
they
went
out
of
the
hotel
into
the
street
mr
robert
king
eyed
the
detective
furtively
ever
and
anon
and
seemed
to
be
impatient
for
him
to
begin
the
conversation
and
inform
him
what
it
was
all
about
there
was
however
such
a
perfect
air
of
ease
and
unconcern
about
manning
that
the
young
brakeman
felt
impelled
to
accompany
him
whether
he
would
or
not
manning
led
the
way
in
the
direction
of
the
office
of
the
chief
of
police
and
after
they
had
fairly
started
he
turned
to
his
companion
and
good
naturedly
said
mr
king
i
suppose
you
are
quite
anxious
to
of
my
business
with
you
well
yes
answered
king
smilingly
for
the
sang
froid
of
manning
had
quite
won
his
heart
i
would
like
to
know
both
of
those
things
well
said
the
detective
my
name
is
john
manning
and
i
am
a
native
of
chicago
i
am
an
intimate
friend
of
tod
duncan
s
and
want
to
know
where
to
find
him
you
will
have
to
ask
somebody
that
can
tell
you
then
answered
king
who
had
now
fully
recovered
his
composure
for
i
do
nt
know
anything
about
him
why
ejaculated
manning
as
though
quite
surprised
at
the
information
i
thought
that
you
and
tod
went
off
on
a
hunting
or
fishing
party
a
few
weeks
ago
and
that
you
came
home
leaving
tod
to
continue
his
journey
alone
that
s
a
mistake
said
king
and
whoever
informed
you
to
that
mr
king
was
evidently
trying
the
good
natured
game
of
bluff
and
manning
noticed
with
some
satisfaction
that
they
were
now
approaching
very
near
to
the
office
of
mr
wallace
see
here
said
he
suddenly
turning
on
his
companion
mr
king
this
wo
nt
do
duncan
is
wanted
for
the
geneva
bank
robbery
he
was
here
three
weeks
ago
and
you
were
with
him
you
got
him
out
of
town
and
if
you
are
not
disposed
to
be
communicative
i
have
simply
got
to
place
you
under
arrest
the
change
in
king
s
manner
was
very
complete
he
was
utterly
surprised
and
nonplused
and
before
he
could
answer
a
word
manning
placed
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
peremptorily
come
in
here
mr
king
perhaps
mr
wallace
can
loosen
your
tongue
illustration
come
in
here
mr
king
perhaps
mr
wallace
can
loosen
your
tongue
they
were
now
directly
in
front
of
the
office
of
the
chief
and
king
and
decidedly
unwise
so
he
deemed
it
best
to
submit
at
once
do
nt
be
too
hard
on
a
fellow
said
he
at
last
i
have
a
good
position
and
i
ca
nt
afford
to
lose
it
if
you
will
give
me
a
chance
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
very
well
come
right
in
here
said
manning
and
if
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
promise
you
no
harm
will
come
to
you
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
closeted
with
the
chief
who
knew
king
very
well
and
who
added
his
assurances
to
those
of
manning
that
if
he
would
unburden
himself
fully
no
danger
need
be
apprehended
i
want
to
say
first
said
king
at
last
convinced
that
it
would
be
better
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
matter
that
what
i
did
was
done
in
good
faith
and
i
only
thought
i
was
helping
a
friend
who
had
got
into
trouble
said
manning
we
will
admit
all
that
but
tell
us
what
you
know
well
answered
king
after
a
pause
in
which
to
collect
himself
it
was
about
three
weeks
ago
that
duncan
came
to
the
city
and
knowing
where
i
stopped
he
came
to
see
me
i
happened
to
be
in
from
my
run
when
he
called
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
could
get
a
leave
of
absence
for
a
week
as
he
wanted
to
go
on
a
fishing
trip
and
would
pay
all
the
shot
at
the
politics
of
his
two
companions
and
he
sank
back
helplessly
in
his
chair
an
awkward
silence
ensued
the
three
men
looked
at
each
other
in
embarrassment
and
confusion
dunn
felt
that
he
had
given
way
to
a
gratuitous
passion
wynn
had
a
vague
presentiment
that
he
had
said
something
that
imperiled
his
daughter
s
prospects
and
brace
was
divided
between
an
angry
retort
and
the
secret
purpose
already
alluded
to
it
s
all
the
blasted
heat
pushing
away
the
whisky
which
wynn
had
ostentatiously
placed
before
him
of
course
said
wynn
hastily
only
it
s
a
pity
nellie
ai
nt
here
to
give
you
her
smelling
salts
she
ought
to
be
back
now
he
added
no
longer
mindful
of
brace
s
presence
the
coach
is
over
due
now
though
i
reckon
the
heat
made
yuba
bill
take
it
easy
at
the
up
grade
if
you
mean
the
coach
from
indian
spring
said
brace
quietly
it
s
in
already
but
miss
nellie
did
nt
come
on
it
may
be
she
got
out
at
the
crossing
said
wynn
cheerfully
she
sometimes
does
she
did
nt
take
the
coach
at
indian
spring
returned
brace
because
i
saw
it
leave
and
passed
it
on
buckskin
ten
minutes
ago
coming
up
the
hills
she
s
stopped
over
at
burnham
s
said
wynn
reflectively
then
in
response
to
the
significant
silence
of
chagrin
which
his
forced
heartiness
could
not
disguise
well
boys
it
s
a
disappointment
all
round
but
we
must
take
the
lesson
as
it
comes
i
ll
go
over
to
the
coach
office
and
see
if
she
s
sent
any
word
make
yourselves
at
home
until
i
return
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
brace
arose
and
took
his
hat
as
if
to
go
with
his
hand
on
the
lock
he
turned
to
his
rival
who
half
hidden
in
the
gathering
darkness
still
seemed
unable
to
comprehend
his
ill
luck
if
you
re
waiting
for
that
bald
headed
fraud
to
come
back
with
the
truth
about
his
daughter
said
brace
coolly
you
d
better
send
for
your
things
and
take
up
your
lodgings
here
what
do
you
mean
said
dunn
sternly
i
mean
that
she
s
not
at
the
burnhams
i
mean
that
he
either
does
or
does
not
know
where
she
is
and
that
in
either
case
he
is
you
can
yes
then
where
is
she
in
the
carquinez
woods
in
the
arms
of
the
man
you
were
just
defending
low
the
half
breed
the
room
had
become
so
dark
that
from
the
road
nothing
could
be
distinguished
only
the
momentary
sound
of
struggling
feet
was
heard
sit
down
said
brace
s
voice
and
do
nt
be
a
fool
you
re
too
weak
and
it
ai
nt
a
fair
fight
let
go
your
hold
i
m
not
lying
i
wish
to
god
i
was
there
was
silence
and
brace
resumed
we
ve
been
rivals
i
know
may
be
i
thought
my
chance
as
good
as
yours
if
what
i
say
ai
nt
truth
we
ll
stand
as
we
stood
before
and
if
you
re
on
the
shoot
i
m
your
man
when
you
like
where
you
like
or
on
sight
if
you
choose
but
i
ca
nt
bear
to
see
another
away
as
i
ve
been
it
ai
nt
on
the
square
there
he
continued
after
a
pause
that
s
right
now
steady
listen
a
week
ago
that
girl
went
down
just
like
this
to
indian
spring
it
was
given
out
like
this
that
she
went
to
the
burnhams
i
do
nt
mind
saying
dunn
that
i
went
down
myself
all
on
the
square
thinking
i
might
get
a
show
to
talk
to
her
just
as
you
might
have
done
you
know
if
you
had
my
chance
i
did
nt
come
across
her
anywhere
but
two
men
that
i
met
thought
they
recognized
her
in
a
disguise
going
into
the
woods
not
suspecting
anything
i
went
after
her
saw
her
at
a
distance
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
in
another
dress
that
i
can
swear
to
and
was
just
coming
up
to
her
when
she
vanished
went
like
a
squirrel
up
a
tree
or
down
like
a
gopher
in
the
ground
said
dunn
s
voice
and
just
because
you
were
a
d
d
fool
or
had
taken
a
little
too
much
whisky
you
thought
steady
that
s
just
what
i
said
to
myself
interrupted
brace
coolly
particularly
when
i
saw
her
that
same
afternoon
in
another
dress
saying
good
by
to
the
burnhams
as
fresh
as
a
rose
and
as
cold
as
those
snow
peaks
only
one
thing
she
had
a
ring
on
her
finger
she
never
wore
before
and
did
nt
expect
me
to
see
what
if
she
did
she
might
have
bought
it
i
reckon
she
has
nt
to
consult
you
broke
in
dunn
s
voice
sternly
she
did
nt
buy
it
continued
brace
quietly
low
gave
that
jew
trader
a
bearskin
in
exchange
for
it
and
presented
it
to
her
i
found
that
out
two
days
afterwards
i
found
out
that
out
of
the
whole
afternoon
she
spent
less
than
an
hour
with
the
burnhams
i
found
out
that
saw
her
in
i
found
the
yellow
dress
she
wore
that
day
hanging
up
in
low
s
cabin
the
place
where
i
saw
her
go
the
rendezvous
where
she
meets
him
oh
you
re
listenin
are
you
stop
sit
down
i
discovered
it
by
accident
continued
the
voice
of
brace
when
all
was
again
quiet
it
was
hidden
as
only
a
squirrel
or
an
injin
can
hide
when
they
improve
upon
nature
when
i
was
satisfied
that
the
girl
had
been
in
the
woods
i
was
determined
to
find
out
where
she
vanished
and
went
there
again
prospecting
around
i
picked
up
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
biggest
trees
this
yer
old
memorandum
book
with
grasses
and
herbs
stuck
in
it
i
remembered
that
i
d
heard
old
wynn
say
that
low
like
the
eyes
with
speech
which
gave
him
the
air
of
an
old
pontiff
he
was
an
imposing
personage
to
look
upon
and
could
be
awful
if
the
occasion
demanded
it
his
creed
was
of
the
sternest
he
was
looked
up
to
as
a
bulwark
against
all
the
laxities
which
threatened
new
england
theology
but
it
was
a
creed
rather
of
the
study
and
of
the
pulpit
than
of
every
day
application
among
his
neighbors
he
dealt
too
much
in
the
lofty
abstractions
which
had
always
such
fascinations
for
the
higher
class
of
new
england
divines
to
busy
himself
as
much
as
he
might
have
done
with
the
spiritual
condition
of
individuals
he
had
also
a
good
deal
in
him
of
what
he
used
to
call
the
old
man
which
as
he
confessed
he
had
never
succeeded
in
putting
off
meaning
thereby
certain
qualities
belonging
to
humanity
as
much
as
the
natural
gifts
of
the
dumb
creatures
belong
to
them
and
tending
to
make
a
man
beloved
by
his
weak
and
erring
fellow
mortals
in
the
olden
time
he
would
have
by
divine
right
as
the
noblest
grandest
wisest
of
all
that
made
up
the
little
nation
within
hearing
of
his
meeting
house
bell
but
young
calvinism
has
less
reverence
and
more
love
of
novelty
than
its
forefathers
it
wants
change
and
it
loves
young
blood
polyandry
is
getting
to
be
the
normal
condition
of
the
church
and
about
the
time
a
man
is
becoming
a
little
overripe
for
the
livelier
human
sentiments
he
may
be
pretty
sure
the
women
are
looking
round
to
find
him
a
colleague
in
this
way
it
was
that
the
rev
joseph
bellamy
stoker
became
the
colleague
of
the
rev
eliphalet
pemberton
if
one
could
have
dived
deep
below
all
the
christian
graces
the
charity
the
sweetness
of
disposition
the
humility
of
father
pemberton
he
would
have
found
a
small
remnant
of
the
old
man
as
the
good
clergyman
would
have
called
it
which
was
never
in
harmony
with
the
rev
mr
stoker
the
younger
divine
felt
his
importance
and
made
his
venerable
colleague
feel
that
he
felt
it
hot
summer
afternoon
services
but
the
junior
pushed
him
aside
without
ceremony
whenever
he
thought
there
was
like
to
be
a
good
show
in
the
pews
as
for
those
courtesies
which
the
old
need
to
soften
the
sense
of
declining
faculties
and
failing
attractions
the
younger
pastor
bestowed
them
in
public
but
was
negligent
of
them
to
say
the
least
when
not
on
exhibition
good
old
father
pemberton
could
not
love
this
man
but
he
would
not
hate
him
and
he
never
complained
to
him
or
of
him
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
if
he
had
the
women
of
the
parish
had
taken
up
the
rev
mr
stoker
and
when
the
women
run
after
a
minister
or
a
doctor
what
do
the
men
signify
why
the
women
ran
after
him
some
thought
it
was
not
hard
to
guess
he
was
not
ill
looking
according
to
the
village
standard
parted
his
hair
smoothly
tied
his
white
cravat
carefully
was
fluent
plausible
had
a
gift
in
prayer
was
considered
and
had
a
sickly
wife
this
is
what
byles
gridley
said
but
he
was
apt
to
be
caustic
at
times
father
pemberton
visited
his
people
but
rarely
like
jonathan
edwards
like
david
osgood
he
felt
his
call
to
be
to
study
work
and
was
impatient
of
the
egotisms
and
spiritual
megrims
in
listening
to
which
especially
from
the
younger
females
of
his
flock
his
colleague
had
won
the
hearts
of
so
many
of
his
parishioners
his
presence
had
a
wonderful
effect
in
restoring
the
despondent
miss
silence
to
her
equanimity
for
not
all
the
hard
divinity
he
had
preached
for
half
a
century
had
spoiled
his
kindly
nature
and
not
the
gentle
melanchthon
himself
ready
to
welcome
death
as
a
refuge
from
the
rage
and
bitterness
of
theologians
was
more
in
contrast
with
the
disputants
with
whom
he
mingled
than
the
old
minister
in
the
hour
of
trial
with
the
stern
dogmatist
in
his
study
forging
thunderbolts
to
smite
down
sinners
it
was
well
that
there
were
no
tithing
men
about
on
sabbath
day
for
the
young
men
within
half
a
dozen
miles
of
the
village
they
were
out
on
bear
hill
the
whole
day
beating
up
the
bushes
as
if
for
game
scaring
old
crows
out
of
their
ragged
nests
and
in
one
dark
glen
startling
a
fierce
eyed
growling
bobtailed
catamount
who
sat
spitting
and
looking
all
ready
to
spring
at
them
on
the
tall
tree
where
he
clung
with
his
claws
unsheathed
until
a
young
fellow
came
up
with
a
gun
and
shot
him
dead
they
went
through
and
through
the
swamp
at
musquash
hollow
but
found
nothing
better
than
a
wicked
old
snapping
turtle
evil
to
behold
with
his
snaky
head
and
alligator
tail
but
worse
to
meddle
with
if
his
horny
jaws
were
near
enough
to
spring
their
man
trap
on
the
curious
experimenter
at
wood
end
there
were
some
indians
ill
conditioned
savages
in
a
dirty
tent
making
baskets
the
miracle
of
which
was
that
they
were
so
clean
they
had
seen
a
young
lady
answering
the
description
about
a
week
if
they
had
a
canoe
they
wanted
to
sell
eyes
like
hers
pointing
to
a
squaw
with
a
man
s
hat
on
at
pocasset
the
young
men
explored
all
the
thick
woods
some
who
ought
to
have
known
better
taking
their
guns
which
made
a
talk
as
one
might
well
suppose
it
would
hunting
on
a
sabbath
day
they
did
nt
mean
to
shoot
myrtle
hazard
did
they
it
was
keenly
asked
a
good
many
said
it
was
all
nonsense
and
a
mere
excuse
to
get
away
from
meeting
and
have
a
sort
of
frolic
on
pretence
that
it
was
a
work
of
necessity
and
mercy
one
or
both
while
they
were
scattering
themselves
about
in
this
way
some
in
earnest
some
rejoicing
in
the
unwonted
license
lifting
off
for
a
little
happened
to
you
and
you
must
expect
to
find
the
explanation
as
strange
as
the
thing
itself
but
it
is
not
hard
to
understand
ida
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
the
expression
of
one
listening
for
her
life
do
you
remember
being
a
little
girl
of
nine
or
ten
years
old
he
asked
oh
yes
she
answered
i
remember
that
perfectly
well
you
are
now
a
young
woman
he
went
on
where
is
that
little
girl
whom
you
remember
what
has
become
of
her
why
i
do
nt
know
replied
ida
i
suppose
she
is
somewhere
in
me
but
you
do
nt
look
like
a
little
girl
or
think
or
act
or
feel
like
one
how
can
she
be
in
you
where
else
could
she
be
replied
ida
oh
there
paul
the
universe
is
big
enough
for
all
the
souls
that
ever
lived
in
it
suppose
now
you
believed
her
to
be
still
alive
as
a
spirit
just
as
she
was
still
alive
somewhere
in
the
land
of
spirits
not
transformed
into
the
young
lady
that
you
are
at
all
you
understand
for
that
would
only
be
another
way
of
saying
that
she
was
dead
but
just
as
she
was
a
child
with
a
child
s
loves
a
child
s
thoughts
a
child
s
feelings
and
a
child
s
face
can
you
suppose
such
a
thing
just
as
an
effort
of
imagination
oh
yes
said
ida
i
can
suppose
that
well
then
said
paul
suppose
also
that
you
remembered
this
little
girl
very
tenderly
and
longed
to
look
on
her
face
again
although
knowing
that
she
was
a
spirit
now
suppose
that
you
went
to
a
woman
having
a
mysterious
power
to
call
up
the
spirits
the
spirit
of
this
child
self
of
yours
and
that
you
recognized
it
and
suppose
that
just
at
that
moment
the
woman
died
and
her
earthly
life
was
transferred
to
the
spirit
of
the
child
so
that
instead
of
being
a
spirit
she
became
again
a
living
child
but
unable
to
recognize
you
who
loved
her
so
well
because
when
she
lived
on
earth
you
of
course
had
not
yet
come
into
existence
suppose
you
brought
this
child
home
with
you
what
do
you
mean
interrupted
ida
with
dilating
eyes
am
i
you
are
to
that
woman
broke
in
paul
indicating
miss
ludington
what
the
child
would
have
been
to
you
you
are
bound
to
her
by
the
same
tie
by
which
that
little
girl
would
have
been
bound
to
you
she
remembers
and
loves
you
as
you
would
remember
and
love
that
child
but
you
do
not
know
her
any
more
than
that
child
would
know
you
you
both
share
the
name
as
to
names
but
i
think
there
is
no
danger
of
your
being
confounded
with
each
other
either
in
your
own
eyes
or
those
of
lookers
on
ida
had
at
last
comprehended
the
piercing
look
expressive
of
mingled
attraction
and
repulsion
which
she
fixed
upon
miss
ludington
left
no
doubt
of
that
it
implied
alarm
mistrust
and
something
that
was
almost
defiance
yet
with
hints
of
a
possible
tenderness
it
was
such
a
look
as
a
daughter
stolen
from
her
cradle
and
grown
to
maidenhood
among
strangers
might
fix
upon
the
woman
claiming
to
be
her
mother
except
that
not
only
was
miss
ludington
a
stranger
to
ida
but
the
relation
which
she
claimed
to
sustain
to
her
was
one
that
had
never
before
been
realized
between
living
persons
on
earth
however
it
might
be
in
heaven
do
you
understand
said
paul
i
think
i
do
but
how
strange
it
is
she
replied
in
lingering
tones
her
gaze
continuing
to
rest
as
if
fascinated
upon
elation
an
impassioned
tenderness
held
in
check
through
fear
of
terrifying
its
object
i
do
not
wonder
it
seems
strange
she
said
very
softly
you
have
yet
no
evidence
as
to
who
i
am
i
remember
you
oh
how
well
but
you
can
not
remember
me
nor
is
there
any
instinct
answering
to
memory
by
which
you
can
recognize
me
you
have
a
right
to
require
that
i
should
prove
that
i
am
what
i
claim
to
be
that
i
am
also
ida
ludington
that
i
am
your
later
self
do
not
fear
my
darling
i
shall
be
able
to
convince
you
very
soon
she
made
ida
sit
down
and
then
went
to
an
ancient
secretary
that
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
unlocked
a
drawer
the
key
to
which
she
always
carried
on
her
person
paul
remembered
from
the
time
he
was
a
little
boy
seeing
her
open
this
drawer
on
sunday
afternoons
and
cry
over
the
keepsakes
which
it
contained
she
took
ribbon
a
locket
a
bunch
of
faded
flowers
and
a
few
other
trifles
and
brought
them
to
ida
paul
left
the
room
on
tiptoe
this
was
a
scene
where
a
third
person
one
might
almost
say
a
second
person
would
be
an
interloper
when
a
long
time
after
he
returned
miss
ludington
was
sitting
in
the
chair
where
ida
had
been
sitting
smiling
and
crying
and
the
girl
with
eyes
that
shone
like
stars
was
bending
over
her
and
kissing
the
tears
away
the
night
was
now
almost
spent
and
the
early
dawn
of
midsummer
peering
through
the
windows
and
already
dimming
the
lights
warned
them
that
the
day
would
soon
be
at
hand
you
shall
have
your
own
bedroom
said
miss
ludington
the
face
of
the
old
lady
was
flushed
and
her
high
pitched
and
tremulous
voice
betrayed
an
exhilaration
like
that
of
intoxication
you
will
excuse
me
for
having
cluttered
it
up
with
my
things
to
morrow
i
will
take
you
would
come
back
to
me
i
had
expected
to
go
to
you
i
and
you
you
and
i
the
girl
repeated
the
words
after
her
slowly
as
if
trying
to
grasp
their
full
meaning
as
she
uttered
them
then
a
sudden
terror
leaped
into
her
eyes
and
she
cried
shudderingly
oh
how
strange
it
is
dear
one
to
let
that
alone
and
rest
in
the
promise
as
thy
days
so
shall
thy
strength
be
the
captain
had
drawn
near
and
was
standing
close
beside
them
mother
has
given
you
the
best
of
advice
my
little
sister
he
said
in
his
kind
cheery
way
it
is
altogether
likely
the
edna
is
safe
in
harbor
somewhere
i
think
they
probably
perceived
the
approach
of
the
storm
in
season
to
be
warned
not
to
put
out
to
sea
till
it
should
be
over
do
you
really
think
so
captain
she
asked
lifting
her
head
to
wipe
away
her
tears
he
assured
her
that
he
did
and
thinking
him
a
competent
judge
of
what
seamen
would
be
likely
to
do
in
such
an
emergency
she
grew
calm
for
a
time
though
her
face
was
still
sad
and
till
darkness
shut
out
the
sight
she
cast
many
an
anxious
glance
from
the
window
upon
the
raging
waters
if
not
in
harbor
they
must
be
in
great
peril
mr
dinsmore
remarked
aside
and
half
inquiringly
to
the
captain
yes
sir
yes
indeed
i
am
far
more
anxious
than
i
should
like
to
own
to
their
mother
zoe
or
violet
it
was
near
their
tea
hour
when
the
storm
but
there
was
little
eating
done
except
by
the
children
and
the
meal
was
not
enlivened
as
was
customary
with
them
by
cheerful
sprightly
chat
though
efforts
in
that
direction
were
not
wanting
on
the
part
of
several
of
their
number
the
storm
raged
on
with
unabated
fury
and
zoe
as
she
listened
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
deafening
thunder
peals
grew
wild
with
terror
for
her
husband
she
could
not
be
persuaded
to
go
to
bed
even
when
her
accustomed
hour
for
retiring
was
long
past
but
would
sit
in
her
chair
moaning
o
ned
ned
my
husband
my
dear
dear
husband
oh
if
i
could
only
do
anything
to
help
you
my
darling
my
darling
you
are
all
i
have
and
i
ca
nt
live
without
you
then
spring
up
and
pace
the
floor
sobbing
wringing
her
hands
and
sometimes
as
a
fierce
blast
shook
the
cottage
or
a
more
deafening
thunder
peal
crashed
over
head
vain
elsie
tried
to
soothe
and
quiet
her
with
reassuring
comforting
words
or
caresses
and
endearments
oh
i
ca
nt
bear
it
she
cried
again
and
again
ned
is
all
i
have
and
it
will
kill
me
to
lose
him
nobody
can
know
how
i
suffer
at
the
very
thought
my
dear
elsie
said
with
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
you
forget
that
edward
is
my
dearly
loved
son
and
that
i
have
two
others
who
are
no
less
dear
to
their
mother
s
heart
on
board
that
vessel
forgive
me
mamma
zoe
sobbed
taking
elsie
s
hand
and
dropping
tears
and
kisses
upon
it
i
did
forget
and
it
was
very
shameful
for
you
are
so
kind
and
loving
to
me
putting
aside
your
own
grief
and
anxiety
to
help
me
in
bearing
mine
but
how
is
it
yon
can
be
so
calm
because
dear
i
am
enabled
to
stay
my
wise
heavenly
father
listen
love
to
these
sweet
words
o
lord
god
of
hosts
who
is
a
strong
lord
like
unto
thee
or
to
thy
faithfulness
round
about
thee
thou
rulest
the
roaring
of
the
sea
when
the
waves
thereof
arise
thou
stillest
them
they
are
beautiful
said
betty
who
sat
near
in
a
despondent
attitude
her
elbow
on
her
knee
her
cheek
in
her
hand
oh
cousin
elsie
i
would
give
all
the
world
for
your
faith
and
to
be
able
to
find
the
comfort
and
support
in
bible
promises
and
teachings
that
you
do
the
outer
door
opened
and
mr
dinsmore
and
captain
raymond
came
in
their
waterproof
coats
dripping
with
rain
they
had
been
out
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
taking
an
observation
though
it
was
little
they
could
see
through
the
darkness
but
occasionally
the
lightning
s
lurid
flash
lit
up
the
scene
for
a
moment
and
afforded
a
glimpse
of
the
captain
said
there
are
at
least
no
signs
of
any
vessel
in
distress
if
any
such
were
near
she
would
undoubtedly
be
firing
signal
guns
so
i
think
we
may
hope
my
conjecture
that
our
boys
are
safe
in
harbor
somewhere
is
correct
and
the
storm
is
passing
over
said
mr
dinsmore
the
thunder
and
lightning
have
almost
ceased
but
the
wind
has
not
fallen
and
that
is
what
makes
the
great
danger
grandpa
is
nt
it
asked
zoe
oh
hark
what
was
that
i
heard
a
step
and
voice
and
rushing
to
the
outer
door
as
she
spoke
she
threw
it
open
and
found
herself
in
her
husband
s
arms
o
ned
ned
she
cried
in
a
transport
of
joy
is
it
really
you
oh
i
thought
i
should
never
see
you
again
you
dear
dear
dear
boy
she
clung
round
his
neck
and
endearing
word
drawing
her
a
little
to
one
side
to
let
his
brothers
step
past
them
and
embrace
the
tender
mother
who
wept
for
joy
as
she
received
them
almost
as
if
restored
to
her
from
the
very
gates
of
death
there
love
i
must
let
you
go
while
i
take
off
this
dripping
coat
edward
said
at
length
releasing
zoe
how
wet
i
have
made
you
i
fear
your
pretty
dress
is
quite
spoiled
he
added
with
a
tender
regretful
smile
that
s
nothing
she
answered
with
a
gay
laugh
you
ll
only
have
to
buy
me
another
and
you
ve
plenty
of
money
plenty
to
supply
all
the
wants
of
my
little
wife
i
hope
ah
mother
dear
as
he
threw
aside
his
wet
overcoat
and
took
her
in
his
arms
were
you
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
your
three
sons
yes
indeed
i
was
i
feel
that
i
have
great
cause
for
thankfulness
in
that
you
are
all
brought
back
to
me
unharmed
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
and
for
be
back
in
half
an
hour
i
shall
not
go
dorothy
said
the
boys
and
i
must
stay
and
look
after
the
stock
what
s
that
evesham
was
listening
to
a
trickling
of
water
outside
the
door
oh
it
s
from
the
kitchen
the
door
s
blown
open
i
guess
dorothy
looked
out
into
the
passage
a
strong
wind
was
blowing
in
from
the
kitchen
where
the
water
covered
the
floor
and
washed
against
the
chimney
this
is
a
nice
state
of
things
what
s
all
this
wood
here
for
the
wood
shed
s
under
water
you
know
you
must
get
yourself
first
in
the
chaise
i
can
not
go
she
said
i
do
nt
believe
there
is
any
danger
this
old
house
has
stood
for
eighty
years
it
s
not
likely
this
is
the
first
big
rain
in
all
that
time
dorothy
s
spirits
had
risen
besides
i
have
a
family
of
orphans
to
take
care
of
see
here
she
said
stooping
over
a
basket
in
the
shadow
of
the
chimney
it
was
the
hospital
tent
and
as
she
uncovered
it
a
brood
of
belated
chickens
stretched
out
their
thin
necks
with
plaintive
peeps
dorothy
covered
them
with
her
hands
and
they
nestled
with
cozy
twitterings
into
silence
you
re
a
kind
of
special
providence
are
nt
you
dorothy
but
i
ve
no
sympathy
with
chickens
who
will
be
born
just
in
time
for
the
equinoctial
i
did
nt
want
them
said
dorothy
anxious
to
defend
her
management
the
old
hen
stole
her
nest
she
s
making
herself
comfortable
now
in
the
corn
bin
she
ought
to
be
made
an
example
of
that
s
the
way
of
the
world
however
retribution
do
nt
fall
always
on
the
right
shoulders
i
must
go
now
we
ll
take
your
mother
and
jimmy
first
and
then
if
you
wo
nt
come
you
shall
let
me
stay
with
you
the
mill
is
safe
enough
anyhow
evesham
returned
with
the
chaise
and
a
man
who
he
insisted
should
drive
away
old
john
and
the
cows
so
dorothy
should
have
less
care
the
mother
was
packed
into
the
chaise
with
a
vast
collection
of
wraps
which
almost
obliterated
jimmy
as
they
started
dorothy
ran
out
in
the
rain
with
her
mother
s
spectacles
and
the
five
letters
which
always
lay
in
a
box
on
the
table
by
her
bed
evesham
took
her
gently
by
the
arms
and
lifted
her
back
across
the
puddles
to
the
stoop
as
the
chaise
drove
off
she
went
back
to
the
sitting
room
in
the
firelight
she
took
out
her
chickens
one
by
one
and
held
them
under
her
chin
with
tender
words
and
finger
touches
if
september
chickens
have
hearts
as
susceptible
as
their
bodies
dorothy
s
orphans
must
have
been
imperilled
by
her
caresses
look
here
dorothy
where
s
my
trowsers
cried
shep
opening
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs

fully
arrayed
in
the
aforesaid
articles
and
carrying
the
bedroom

them
said
dorothy

mill
loft
and
go
sailin
down

jordan

sheets

wind
and

old

said
dorothy
we

to
try
it
yet
there

an
awful
roarin
from
our
window
said
shep
thee

nt
half
hear
it
down
here
come
out
on
the
stoop
the
old
ponds
have
got
their
dander
up
this
time
they
opened
the
door
and
listened
standing
together
on
the
low
step
there
was
indeed
a
hoarse
murmur
from
the
hills
which
grew
there
goes
the
stable
door
there
was
only
one
hinge
left
anyway
said
reuby
mighty
look
at
that
wave
it
crashed
through
the
gate
swept
across
the
garden
and
broke
at
their
feet
sending
a
thin
sheet
of
water
over
the
floor
and
stoop
now
it
s
gone
into
the
entry
why

thee

anyhow
let
s
go
over
to
the
mill
say
dorothy
sha
nt
we
wait
there
comes
another
wave
the
second
onset
was
not
so
violent
but
they
hastened
to
gather
together
a
few
blankets
and
the
boys
filled
their
pockets
with
a
delightful
sense
of
unusualness
and
peril
almost
equal
to
a
shipwreck
or
an
attack
by
indians
dorothy
took
her
unlucky
chickens
under
her
cloak
and
they
made
a
rush
all
together
across
the
road
and
up
the
slope
to
the
mill
said
dorothy
as
they
huddled
together
on
the
platform
of
the
scale
will
thee
go
back
after
one
shep
if
reuby
ll
go
too
well
my
legs

for
kingdom
come
a
furious
head
of
water
was
rushing
along
the
race
the
great
wheel
creaked
and
swung
over
and
with
a
shudder
the
old
mill
awoke
from
its
long
sleep
the
cogs
clenched
their
teeth
the
shafting
shook
and
rattled
the
stones
whirled
merrily
round
now
she
goes
it
cried
shep
as
the
humming
increased
to
time
until
the
day
dawned
he
lay
pondering
on
the
course
of
conduct
he
had
best
pursue
the
advantage
of
the
purchase
he
had
made
was
so
great
that
mr
bolton
thought
of
relinquishing
it
with
great
reluctance
on
the
other
hand
his
obligation
to
the
farmer
was
of
such
a
nature
that
he
must
in
clinging
to
his
bargain
forfeit
his
self
respect
and
must
suffer
at
any
time
that
he
happened
to
meet
mr
gray
face
to
face
finally
after
a
long
struggle
continued
through
several
days
he
resolved
to
forego
the
good
he
had
attempted
to
grasp
how
many
years
since
this
man
had
done
a
generous
action
since
he
had
relinquished
a
selfish
and
sordid
purpose
out
of
regard
to
another
s
well
being
and
now
it
had
cost
him
a
desperate
struggle
but
after
the
trial
was
past
his
mind
became
tranquil
and
he
could
think
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
with
an
emotion
of
pleasure
that
was
new
in
his
experience
immediately
on
this
resolution
being
formed
mr
bolton
called
upon
his
agent
his
first
inquiry
was
when
did
you
see
gray
the
previous
owner
of
your
farm
yes
not
since
the
sale
you
told
me
to
let
every
thing
remain
as
it
was
has
nt
he
called
no
the
loss
of
his
farm
must
be
felt
that
every
man
feels
his
losses
as
misfortunes
but
we
all
have
to
take
the
good
and
the
bad
in
life
together
it
s
his
luck
and
he
must
put
up
with
it
i
wonder
if
he
has
nt
other
property
no
are
you
certain
oh
yes
i
know
exactly
what
he
was
worth
he
had
been
overseer
for
elbertson
for
several
years
and
while
there
managed
to
save
seven
hundred
dollars
with
which
he
paid
down
the
cash
required
in
purchasing
his
farm
since
then
he
has
been
paying
off
the
mortgage
that
remained
on
the
property
and
but
for
the
burning
of
his
barn
might
have
prevented
a
result
that
has
been
so
disastrous
to
himself
but
it
s
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
in
every
loss
somebody
gains
and
the
turn
of
the
die
has
been
in
your
favour
this
time
mr
bolton
did
not
appear
to
feel
as
much
satisfaction
at
this
seeing
this
he
changed
the
subject
by
asking
some
question
about
the
consummation
of
the
sale
under
the
mortgage
i
ll
see
you
about
that
to
morrow
said
mr
bolton
very
well
was
replied
after
some
more
conversation
mr
bolton
left
the
office
of
his
agent
for
years
farmer
gray
had
been
toiling
late
and
early
to
become
the
full
owner
of
his
beautiful
farm
its
value
had
much
increased
since
it
had
come
into
his
possession
and
he
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
time
when
it
would
be
his
own
beyond
all
doubt
but
the
loss
of
an
entire
year
s
crop
through
the
burning
of
his
barn
deeply
tried
and
dispirited
him
from
this
grievous
disappointment
his
spirits
were
beginning
to
rise
when
the
sudden
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage
and
hurried
sale
of
his
farm
crushed
all
his
hopes
to
the
earth
who
the
real
purchaser
of
his
farm
was
mr
gray
did
not
know
for
the
broker
had
bought
in
his
own
disaster
that
for
several
days
subsequent
to
the
sale
he
remained
almost
totally
paralyzed
in
mind
no
plans
were
laid
for
the
future
nor
even
those
ordinary
steps
for
the
present
taken
that
common
prudence
would
suggest
he
wandered
about
the
farm
or
sat
at
home
dreamily
musing
upon
what
seemed
the
utter
ruin
of
all
his
best
hopes
in
life
while
in
this
state
he
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
mr
bolton
the
old
gentleman
in
taking
him
by
the
hand
said
what
s
the
matter
my
friend
you
appear
in
trouble
and
i
am
in
trouble
was
unhesitatingly
answered
not
so
deep
but
that
you
may
get
out
of
it
again
i
hope
mr
gray
shook
his
head
in
a
desponding
way
what
is
the
trouble
mr
bolton
inquired
i
have
lost
my
farm
oh
no
it
is
too
true
it
has
been
sold
for
a
mortgage
more
than
that
sum
on
account
of
the
purchase
it
only
brought
enough
to
pay
the
encumbrance
and
i
am
ruined
the
farmer
was
deeply
disturbed
and
mr
bolton
s
feelings
were
much
interested
do
nt
be
so
troubled
my
good
friend
said
the
old
gentleman
you
rendered
me
a
service
in
the
time
of
need
and
it
is
now
in
my
power
to
return
it
the
farm
is
still
yours
i
hold
the
mortgage
and
you
need
not
fear
another
foreclosure
some
moments
passed
after
this
announcement
before
mr
gray
s
mind
became
clear
and
his
entire
self
possession
returned
then
grasping
the
hand
of
mr
bolton
he
thanked
him
with
all
the
eloquence
a
grateful
heart
inspires
it
was
the
happiest
moment
the
old
merchant
had
seen
for
years
the
mere
possession
of
a
thousand
or
two
of
dollars
seemed
as
nothing
to
the
pleasure
he
felt
at
having
performed
a
good
action
or
rather
at
having
refrained
from
doing
an
evil
one
what
he
had
done
and
recalling
the
delight
shown
by
mr
gray
and
his
kind
partner
who
had
attended
him
so
carefully
while
he
lay
a
sufferer
beneath
their
roof
his
heart
swelled
in
his
bosom
with
a
new
and
happy
emotion
having
once
permitted
himself
to
regard
another
with
an
unselfish
interest
that
interest
continued
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
do
enough
for
the
farmer
in
the
way
of
aiding
him
to
develop
the
resources
of
his
little
property
in
this
he
did
not
merely
stop
at
suggestions
but
tendered
something
more
substantial
and
available
nor
did
the
feelings
awakened
in
his
mind
run
all
in
this
direction
occasions
enough
offered
for
him
to
be
generous
to
others
and
to
refrain
from
oppression
for
the
sake
of
gain
many
of
these
were
gospel
preached
among
them
to
this
however
the
preacher
very
naturally
demurred
and
said
that
he
was
not
sent
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
where
will
i
stop
to
night
he
inquired
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
on
sunday
morning
he
was
to
preach
at
his
first
appointment
well
said
the
brother
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
can
tell
you
where
you
ought
to
stop
but
i
do
nt
know
you
will
be
so
welcome
there
as
at
a
poorer
place
brother
martin
is
better
able
to
entertain
the
preachers
comfortably
than
any
one
else
in
that
section
but
i
believe
he
has
never
invited
them
home
and
they
have
generally
gone
to
the
house
of
a
good
widow
lady
named
russell
whose
barrel
of
meal
and
cruse
of
oil
deserve
never
to
fail
she
is
about
the
only
real
christian
among
them
yes
and
comfortably
off
but
how
he
ever
expects
to
get
his
load
of
selfishness
into
heaven
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
must
not
be
uncharitable
brother
said
odell
i
know
that
but
truth
is
truth
however
you
must
see
and
judge
for
yourself
i
think
you
had
better
go
to
the
house
of
sister
russell
who
will
welcome
you
with
all
her
heart
and
give
you
the
best
she
has
and
i
want
no
more
said
the
preacher
after
getting
precise
directions
for
finding
sister
russell
he
started
on
his
journey
it
was
nearly
five
o
clock
and
he
made
his
calculation
to
reach
sister
russell
s
by
seven
where
he
would
remain
all
night
and
go
with
her
to
the
preaching
place
on
sunday
morning
he
had
not
however
been
half
an
hour
on
his
journey
before
heavy
masses
of
deep
blue
clouds
began
to
roll
up
from
the
horizon
and
spread
over
the
sky
and
large
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
as
the
beginning
of
a
heavy
storm
the
preacher
was
constrained
to
turn
aside
and
seek
the
shelter
of
a
farm
house
where
he
was
received
with
much
kindness
night
fall
brought
no
abatement
of
the
tempest
the
lightning
still
blazed
out
in
broad
masses
of
fire
the
thunder
jarred
and
rattled
amid
the
clouds
like
parks
of
artillery
and
the
rain
continued
to
pour
down
unceasingly
the
invitation
to
remain
all
night
which
the
farmer
and
his
wife
tendered
in
all
sincerity
was
not
of
course
declined
by
the
preacher
in
the
morning
after
being
served
with
a
plentiful
breakfast
odell
returned
his
warmest
thanks
for
the
kindness
he
had
received
and
proceeded
on
his
journey
he
had
five
miles
to
ride
but
it
was
only
half
past
eight
o
clock
when
he
started
and
as
the
hour
for
preaching
was
ten
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
him
to
proceed
at
his
leisure
as
sister
russell
lived
nearly
a
mile
away
from
a
direct
her
but
went
on
to
the
meeting
house
on
reaching
the
little
country
church
mr
odell
found
a
small
company
of
men
assembled
in
front
of
the
humble
building
who
looked
at
him
curiously
and
with
something
of
shyness
in
their
manner
as
he
rode
up
and
dismounted
no
one
offering
to
take
his
horse
he
led
him
aside
to
a
little
grove
and
tied
the
reins
to
a
tree
one
or
two
of
the
men
nodded
distantly
as
he
passed
them
on
his
way
to
the
meeting
house
door
but
none
of
them
spoke
to
him
on
entering
the
meeting
house
mr
odell
found
some
thirty
persons
assembled
most
of
them
women
if
there
were
any
official
members
present
they
made
themselves
in
no
way
officious
in
regard
to
the
preacher
who
after
pausing
at
the
door
leading
into
the
little
altar
or
chancel
for
a
short
time
and
looking
around
with
an
expression
of
inquiry
on
his
face
ascended
the
pulpit
stairs
and
took
his
seat
all
was
as
tenantless
in
a
little
while
the
preacher
arose
and
gave
out
a
hymn
but
there
was
no
one
to
raise
the
tune
one
looked
at
another
uneasily
sundry
persons
coughed
and
cleared
their
throats
but
all
remained
silent
odell
was
not
much
of
a
singer
but
had
practised
on
old
hundred
so
much
that
he
could
lead
that
air
very
well
and
the
hymn
happening
by
good
luck
to
be
set
to
a
long
metre
tune
he
was
able
to
start
it
this
done
the
congregation
joined
in
and
the
singing
went
off
pretty
well
after
praying
and
reading
a
chapter
in
the
bible
odell
sat
down
to
collect
his
thoughts
for
the
sermon
which
was
of
course
to
be
extempore
as
methodist
sermons
usually
are
it
is
customary
for
the
choir
if
there
is
one
to
sing
an
anthem
during
this
pause
or
where
no
singers
are
set
apart
for
some
members
to
strike
up
an
appropriate
hymn
in
which
silent
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
mr
odell
arose
and
turning
in
the
bible
to
the
chapter
where
the
text
from
which
he
was
to
preach
was
recorded
read
the
verse
that
was
to
form
the
groundwork
of
his
remarks
before
opening
the
subject
he
stated
briefly
that
he
was
the
preacher
who
was
to
labour
among
them
during
the
ensuing
year
and
hoped
in
the
divine
providence
that
good
both
to
them
and
to
him
would
result
from
the
new
spiritual
relations
that
were
about
to
be
commenced
then
proceeding
with
his
discourse
he
preached
to
and
exhorted
them
with
great
earnestness
but
without
seeming
to
make
any
impression
not
an
amen
was
heard
from
any
part
of
the
house
not
an
eye
grew
moist
not
an
audible
groan
or
sigh
disturbed
the
air
nothing
responded
to
his
appeals
but
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
never
had
the
preacher
delivered
a
discourse
in
which
he
felt
so
little
freedom
of
a
dull
reverberation
as
if
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
were
of
ice
instead
of
flesh
before
singing
the
last
hymn
which
mr
odell
gave
out
instead
of
several
times
during
one
of
the
periods
of
two
weeks
that
he
was
regularly
absent
the
sunday
morning
when
he
was
expected
home
arrived
but
it
did
not
bring
as
usual
his
anxiously
looked
for
presence
his
wife
was
almost
beside
herself
with
alarm
no
letter
coming
on
monday
she
took
her
child
and
started
for
louisville
in
the
first
boat
she
arrived
at
herself
a
total
stranger
to
all
therein
except
her
husband
and
perfectly
ignorant
as
to
where
he
was
to
be
found
the
captain
of
the
steamboat
kindly
attended
her
to
a
boarding
house
and
there
she
was
left
without
a
single
clue
in
her
mind
as
to
the
means
of
finding
her
husband
inquiries
were
made
of
all
in
the
boarding
house
but
no
one
had
heard
even
the
name
of
joseph
fletcher
as
soon
as
she
could
make
arrangements
to
get
out
mrs
fletcher
visited
all
the
dry
goods
stores
in
the
city
for
in
some
one
of
these
she
supposed
her
husband
to
be
employed
although
he
had
never
stated
particularly
the
kind
of
business
in
which
he
was
engaged
this
search
after
being
continued
for
a
greater
part
of
the
day
turned
out
fruitless
night
found
the
unhappy
wife
in
an
agony
of
suspense
and
alarm
some
one
at
the
boarding
house
advised
her
to
have
an
advertisement
for
her
husband
inserted
in
a
morning
paper
she
did
not
hesitate
long
about
this
course
and
about
nine
o
clock
a
man
called
and
asked
to
see
her
she
descended
from
her
room
to
the
parlour
with
a
wildly
throbbing
heart
but
staggered
forward
and
sank
into
a
chair
weak
almost
as
an
infant
when
she
saw
that
the
man
was
a
stranger
instead
of
her
husband
whom
she
had
expected
to
meet
are
you
mrs
fletcher
he
asked
i
am
she
faintly
replied
you
advertised
for
information
in
regard
to
your
husband
i
did
where
is
he
oh
sir
has
any
thing
happened
to
him
no
ma
am
nothing
serious
he
has
only
been
sick
for
a
week
or
ten
days
that
is
the
man
i
refer
to
has
your
husband
is
a
tailor
is
the
man
you
speak
of
a
tailor
eagerly
asked
mrs
fletcher
he
is
ma
am
and
has
been
working
for
me
at
no
fourth
street
then
he
is
not
into
tears
my
husband
is
a
clerk
in
the
bitterness
of
a
keen
disappointment
rendered
sharper
by
doubt
and
fear
mrs
fletcher
wept
for
some
minutes
when
she
could
command
her
feelings
to
some
extent
she
thanked
the
tailor
for
calling
and
repeated
what
she
had
said
that
the
man
at
his
house
could
not
be
her
husband
he
is
from
cincinnati
ma
am
and
goes
there
once
in
every
two
weeks
i
know
that
he
has
wife
and
child
there
said
the
man
still
he
can
not
be
my
husband
replied
mrs
fletcher
for
my
husband
is
not
a
tailor
no
not
in
that
case
certainly
and
the
man
owed
and
withdrew
all
day
long
the
wife
waited
for
some
more
satisfactory
reply
to
her
advertisement
but
no
farther
response
to
it
was
made
the
call
of
the
tailor
seemed
like
a
mockery
of
her
unhappy
condition
night
came
and
all
remained
in
doubt
and
darkness
the
visit
of
the
tailor
half
despairingly
in
order
to
find
some
feeble
gleam
of
hope
perhaps
she
said
to
herself
as
she
thought
about
it
there
is
some
mistake
perhaps
it
is
my
husband
after
all
and
the
man
is
in
some
error
about
his
being
a
tailor
as
she
thought
it
suddenly
flashed
through
her
mind
that
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
mystery
made
by
her
husband
about
his
situation
in
cincinnati
as
well
as
in
louisville
which
always
struck
her
as
a
little
strange
could
it
be
possible
that
his
real
business
was
that
of
a
tailor
all
at
once
she
remembered
that
her
husband
had
been
particularly
silent
in
regard
to
his
early
history
trembling
with
excitement
she
left
the
house
about
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
started
for
the
place
where
she
remembered
that
the
tailor
said
he
lived
he
was
in
his
shop
and
recollected
her
the
moment
she
entered
can
i
see
the
man
you
told
me
was
named
fletcher
i
sincerely
hope
there
has
been
some
mistake
and
that
you
will
find
him
to
be
your
husband
for
he
is
very
ill
and
needs
to
be
nursed
by
a
careful
hand
mrs
fletcher
followed
the
tailor
up
stairs
her
heart
scarcely
beating
under
the
pressure
of
suspense
in
a
small
chamber
in
the
third
story
the
atmosphere
of
which
was
close
oppressive
and
filled
with
an
offensive
odour
she
was
shown
a
man
lying
upon
a
bed
she
needed
not
a
second
glance
as
the
dim
light
fell
upon
his
pale
emaciated
face
to
decide
her
doubts
her
husband
lay
before
her
eagerly
she
called
his
name
but
his
eyes
did
not
open
she
spoke
to
him
again
and
again
but
he
did
not
recognise
even
if
he
heard
her
voice
on
inquiring
she
found
that
he
was
ill
with
a
violent
fever
which
the
doctor
said
was
about
at
its
crisis
this
had
been
brought
on
by
too
long
continued
labour
he
having
worked
that
means
earning
a
third
more
wages
than
any
journeyman
in
the
shop
alarmed
and
troubled
as
she
was
mrs
fletcher
was
utterly
confounded
by
all
this
she
could
not
comprehend
it
all
night
she
hovered
over
the
pillow
of
her
husband
giving
him
medicine
at
the
proper
times
placing
the
cooling
draught
to
his
lips
or
bathing
his
hot
forehead
frequently
she
called
his
name
earnestly
and
tenderly
but
the
sound
awoke
no
motions
in
his
sluggish
mind
toward
morning
she
was
sitting
with
her
face
resting
against
a
pillow
when
his
voice
speaking
distinctly
aroused
her
from
a
half
slumber
into
which
she
had
momentarily
lost
herself
in
an
instant
she
leave
the
room
for
a
short
period
i
think
with
you
said
miss
jones
the
visitor
that
mrs
fleetwood
errs
very
greatly
in
the
management
of
her
children
management
she
has
no
management
at
all
interrupted
miss
spencer
in
not
managing
her
children
then
if
you
will
so
i
have
told
her
over
and
over
again
but
to
why
if
i
had
a
child
i
would
never
suffer
it
to
cry
after
it
was
six
months
old
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
prevent
it
and
yet
one
of
sarah
s
children
does
little
else
but
fret
and
cry
all
the
time
she
insists
upon
it
that
it
ca
nt
feel
well
and
suppose
this
to
be
the
case
crying
does
it
no
good
but
in
reality
a
great
deal
of
harm
if
it
is
sick
it
has
made
itself
so
by
crying
very
likely
i
ve
known
many
such
instances
remarked
miss
jones
mrs
fleetwood
returning
at
the
moment
checked
this
train
of
conversation
she
did
not
allude
to
the
circumstance
that
caused
her
to
leave
the
room
but
endeavoured
to
withdraw
attention
from
it
by
some
pleasant
remarks
calculated
to
interest
the
visitor
and
give
the
thoughts
of
all
a
new
direction
i
hope
you
punished
earnest
as
he
deserved
to
be
said
her
sister
i
never
saw
such
a
child
he
certainly
behaved
badly
returned
mrs
fleetwood
speaking
in
an
absent
manner
he
behaved
outrageously
if
i
had
a
child
and
he
were
to
act
as
earnest
did
this
morning
i
d
teach
him
a
lesson
that
he
would
not
forget
in
a
year
no
doubt
your
children
will
be
under
very
good
government
martha
said
mrs
fleetwood
a
little
sarcastically
if
they
are
not
under
better
government
than
yours
i
ll
send
them
all
to
the
house
of
refuge
retorted
miss
martha
the
colour
on
mrs
fleetwood
s
cheeks
grew
warmer
at
this
remark
but
she
thought
it
best
not
to
reply
in
a
manner
likely
to
provoke
a
further
insulting
retort
and
merely
said
if
ever
you
come
to
have
children
of
your
own
sister
you
will
be
able
to
understand
better
than
you
now
do
a
mother
s
trials
doubts
and
difficulties
at
present
you
think
you
know
nothing
i
know
replied
martha
that
i
could
manage
my
own
children
a
great
deal
better
than
you
manage
yours
if
such
should
prove
to
be
the
case
no
one
will
be
more
rejoiced
at
the
result
than
i
but
i
look
rather
to
see
your
children
if
you
should
ever
become
a
mother
worse
governed
than
most
people
s
you
do
yes
i
do
and
why
pray
because
my
own
observation
tells
me
that
those
persons
who
are
most
inclined
to
see
defects
in
family
government
and
to
find
fault
with
other
people
s
management
of
their
children
are
apt
to
have
the
most
unruly
young
scape
graces
in
their
houses
to
be
found
anywhere
that
s
all
nonsense
the
fact
that
a
person
observes
and
reflects
ought
to
make
that
person
better
qualified
to
act
right
observation
and
reflection
no
doubt
will
but
right
observation
and
reflection
fearful
on
the
subject
of
their
right
government
rather
than
bold
and
boastful
those
who
like
you
think
themselves
so
well
qualified
to
manage
children
usually
make
the
worst
managers
it
s
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
in
that
way
said
martha
tossing
her
head
but
if
i
ever
have
children
of
my
own
i
ll
show
you
whether
i
have
the
worst
young
scape
graces
to
be
found
anywhere
a
low
fretful
cry
or
rather
whine
had
been
heard
from
a
child
near
the
door
of
the
room
for
some
time
it
was
one
of
those
annoying
irritating
cries
that
proceed
more
from
a
fretful
state
of
mind
than
from
any
adequate
external
exciting
cause
martha
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
do
you
think
i
would
suffer
a
child
to
cry
about
the
house
half
of
its
time
as
ellen
does
no
indeed
i
d
soon
settle
that
how
would
you
do
it
suppose
you
could
nt
could
nt
that
s
not
the
way
for
a
mother
to
talk
excuse
me
martha
said
mrs
fleetwood
rising
i
would
rather
not
hear
such
remarks
from
you
and
now
repeat
what
i
have
before
said
more
than
once
that
i
wish
you
to
leave
me
free
to
do
what
i
think
right
in
my
own
family
as
i
undoubtedly
will
leave
you
free
if
ever
you
should
have
one
and
mrs
fleetwood
left
the
room
and
taking
the
little
girl
who
was
crying
at
the
door
by
the
hand
led
her
up
stairs
what
is
the
matter
ellen
she
asked
as
calmly
and
as
soothingly
as
the
irritating
nature
of
ellen
s
peculiar
cry
or
whine
would
permit
her
earnest
wo
nt
play
with
me
replied
the
child
still
crying
come
up
into
my
room
and
see
if
there
is
nt
something
pretty
there
to
play
with
answer
yes
come
and
mrs
fleetwood
led
along
the
resisting
child
no
no
no
i
do
nt
want
to
go
i
want
earnest
to
play
with
me
humph
i
d
stop
that
pretty
quick
remarked
miss
spencer
to
herself
as
the
petulant
cry
of
the
child
grew
louder
i
d
never
allow
a
child
of
mine
to
go
on
like
that
mrs
fleetwood
felt
disturbed
but
experience
had
taught
her
that
whenever
she
spoke
from
an
irritated
state
her
words
rather
increased
than
allayed
the
evil
she
sought
to
correct
so
she
drew
the
child
along
with
her
using
some
force
in
order
to
do
it
until
she
reached
her
chamber
her
strongest
impulse
on
being
alone
with
ellen
who
still
continued
crying
was
to
silence
her
instantly
by
the
most
summary
process
to
which
parental
authority
usually
has
resort
in
such
cases
but
her
mother
s
heart
suggested
the
better
plan
of
diverting
ellen
s
mind
if
possible
and
thus
getting
it
she
tried
corn
and
potatoes
not
at
all
it
is
chiefly
on
you
and
for
your
sakes
mamma
and
i
decided
to
go
to
the
country
at
last
in
reply
to
my
inquiries
and
my
answers
to
advertisements
n
y
march
st
robert
durham
esq
dear
sir
i
have
a
place
that
will
suit
you
i
think
it
can
be
bought
at
about
the
figure
you
name
come
to
see
it
i
sha
nt
crack
it
up
but
want
you
to
judge
for
yourself
resp
y
john
jones
i
had
been
to
see
two
or
three
places
that
had
been
cracked
up
so
highly
that
my
wife
thought
it
better
to
close
the
bargain
at
once
before
some
one
else
secured
the
prize
and
i
had
come
back
disgusted
in
each
instance
the
soul
of
wit
was
in
john
jones
s
letter
there
was
also
a
downright
directness
which
hit
the
mark
and
i
wrote
that
i
would
go
to
maizeville
in
the
course
of
the
following
week
chapter
vi
a
bluff
friend
the
almanac
had
announced
spring
nature
appeared
quite
unaware
of
the
fact
but
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
the
almanac
was
right
spring
was
the
era
of
hope
of
change
s
bean
in
spite
of
lowering
wintry
skies
we
were
as
eager
as
robins
sojourning
in
the
south
to
take
our
flight
northward
my
duties
to
my
employers
had
ceased
the
st
of
march
i
had
secured
tenants
who
would
take
possession
of
our
rooms
as
soon
as
we
should
leave
them
and
now
every
spare
moment
was
given
to
studying
the
problem
of
country
living
and
to
preparations
for
departure
i
obtained
illustrated
catalogues
from
several
dealers
in
seeds
and
we
pored
over
them
every
evening
at
first
they
bewildered
us
with
their
long
lists
of
varieties
while
the
glowing
descriptions
of
new
kinds
of
vegetables
just
being
introduced
awakened
in
us
something
of
a
gambling
spirit
how
fortunate
it
is
exclaimed
my
wife
that
we
are
going
to
the
country
just
as
the
vegetable
marvels
were
discovered
why
robert
if
half
of
what
is
said
is
true
we
shall
make
our
fortunes
with
us
hitherto
a
beet
had
been
a
beet
and
beets
which
as
merton
said
beat
all
creation
and
pictures
of
prodigious
cabbage
heads
which
well
nigh
turned
our
own
with
a
blending
of
hope
and
distrust
i
carried
two
of
the
catalogues
to
a
shrewd
old
fellow
in
washington
market
he
was
a
dealer
in
country
produce
who
had
done
business
so
long
at
the
same
stand
that
among
his
fellows
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
kind
of
patriarch
during
a
former
interview
he
had
replied
to
my
questions
with
a
blunt
honesty
that
had
inspired
confidence
the
day
was
somewhat
mild
and
i
found
him
in
his
shirt
sleeves
smoking
his
pipe
among
his
piled
up
barrels
boxes
and
crates
after
his
eleven
o
clock
dinner
his
day
s
work
was
practically
over
and
well
it
might
be
for
like
others
of
his
calling
he
had
begun
it
long
before
dawn
now
his
old
felt
hat
was
pushed
well
back
on
his
bald
head
and
his
red
face
fringed
with
a
grizzled
beard
expressed
a
sort
of
heavy
as
ever
with
his
pipe
he
indicated
a
box
on
which
i
might
sit
while
we
talked
see
here
mr
bogart
i
began
showing
him
the
seed
catalogues
how
is
a
man
to
choose
wisely
what
vegetables
he
will
raise
from
a
list
as
long
as
your
arm
perhaps
i
should
nt
take
any
of
those
old
fashioned
kinds
but
go
into
these
wonderful
novelties
which
promise
a
new
era
in
horticulture
the
old
man
gave
a
contemptuous
grunt
then
removing
his
pipe
he
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
that
half
obscured
us
both
as
he
remarked
gruffly
a
fool
and
his
money
are
soon
parted
this
was
about
as
rough
as
march
weather
but
i
knew
my
man
and
perhaps
proved
that
i
was
nt
a
fool
by
not
parting
with
him
then
and
there
come
now
neighbor
i
said
brusquely
i
know
some
things
that
you
do
nt
and
there
are
affairs
in
which
am
in
this
matter
if
you
came
to
me
i
d
give
you
the
best
advice
that
i
could
and
be
civil
about
it
into
the
bargain
i
ve
come
to
you
because
i
believe
you
to
be
honest
and
to
know
what
i
do
nt
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
a
little
family
dependent
on
me
and
that
i
mean
if
possible
to
get
a
living
for
them
out
of
the
soil
i
believe
you
are
man
enough
both
to
fall
in
with
my
plan
and
to
show
a
little
friendly
interest
if
you
are
not
i
ll
go
farther
and
fare
better
as
i
fired
this
broadside
he
looked
at
me
askance
with
the
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
then
reached
out
his
great
brown
paw
and
said
shake
i
knew
it
was
all
right
now
that
the
giving
of
his
hand
meant
not
only
a
treaty
of
peace
but
also
a
friendly
alliance
the
old
fellow
discoursed
vegetable
wisdom
so
steadily
for
half
an
let
that
new
fangled
truck
alone
he
said
till
you
get
more
forehanded
in
cash
and
experience
then
you
may
learn
how
to
make
something
out
of
them
novelties
as
they
call
em
if
they
are
worth
growing
at
all
now
and
then
a
good
penny
is
turned
on
a
new
fruit
or
vegetable
but
how
to
do
it
will
be
one
of
the
last
tricks
that
you
ll
learn
in
your
new
trade
hand
me
one
of
them
misleadin
books
and
i
ll
mark
a
few
solid
kinds
such
as
produce
ninety
nine
hundredths
of
all
that
s
used
or
sold
then
you
go
to
what
you
call
em
s
store
and
take
a
line
from
me
and
you
ll
git
the
genuine
article
at
market
gardeners
prices
now
mr
bogart
you
are
treating
handwriting
surprisingly
like
it
he
began
to
read
it
with
feverish
haste
the
letter
need
not
find
a
place
here
the
substance
of
it
had
been
accurately
given
by
mr
allan
roscoe
apparently
it
corroborated
his
every
statement
the
boy
looked
up
from
its
perusal
his
face
pale
and
stricken
you
see
that
i
have
good
authority
for
my
statement
said
mr
roscoe
i
ca
nt
understand
it
said
hector
slowly
i
need
only
add
said
mr
roscoe
apparently
relieved
by
the
revelation
that
my
brother
did
not
repose
confidence
in
me
in
vain
i
accept
as
a
sacred
charge
the
duty
he
imposed
upon
me
i
shall
provide
for
you
and
in
a
way
to
prepare
yourself
for
a
useful
and
honorable
career
as
a
first
step
i
intend
on
monday
next
to
place
you
in
an
excellent
boarding
school
where
you
will
have
exceptional
privileges
hector
listened
but
his
mind
was
occupied
by
sad
thoughts
and
he
made
no
comment
i
have
even
selected
the
school
with
great
care
said
mr
roscoe
it
is
situated
at
smithville
and
is
under
the
charge
of
socrates
smith
a
m
a
learned
and
distinguished
educator
you
may
go
now
i
will
speak
with
you
on
this
subject
later
hector
bowed
after
what
he
had
heard
his
interest
in
other
matters
was
but
faint
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
thought
allan
roscoe
i
never
liked
him
chapter
iv
a
skirmish
hector
walked
out
of
the
house
in
a
state
of
mental
bewilderment
not
easily
described
was
he
not
hector
roscoe
after
all
if
this
story
were
true
who
was
he
who
were
his
parents
what
was
his
name
why
had
the
man
whom
he
had
supposed
to
be
his
father
not
imparted
to
him
this
secret
he
had
always
been
kind
and
indulgent
he
had
never
appeared
to
regard
the
boy
as
an
alien
in
blood
but
as
a
dearly
loved
son
yet
if
he
had
after
all
left
him
unprovided
for
he
had
certainly
treated
hector
with
great
cruelty
i
wo
nt
believe
it
said
hector
to
himself
i
wo
nt
so
wrong
my
dear
father
s
memory
at
the
bidding
of
this
man
whose
interest
it
is
to
trump
up
this
story
since
he
and
his
son
become
the
owners
of
a
great
estate
in
my
place
just
then
guy
advanced
toward
hector
with
a
malicious
smile
upon
his
face
he
knew
very
well
what
a
blow
poor
hector
had
received
for
he
was
in
his
father
s
confidence
and
he
was
mean
enough
what
s
the
matter
with
you
hector
he
asked
with
a
grin
you
look
as
if
you
had
lost
your
last
friend
hector
stopped
short
and
regarded
guy
fixedly
do
you
know
what
your
father
has
been
saying
to
me
he
asked
well
i
can
guess
answered
guy
ho
ho
it
s
a
great
joke
that
you
have
all
the
time
fancied
yourself
the
heir
of
castle
roscoe
when
you
have
no
claim
to
it
at
all
i
am
the
heir
he
added
drawing
himself
up
proudly
and
you
are
a
poor
dependent
and
a
nobody
it
s
funny
perhaps
you
wo
nt
think
it
so
funny
after
this
said
hector
coolly
exasperated
beyond
endurance
as
he
spoke
he
drew
off
and
in
an
instant
guy
measured
his
length
upon
the
greensward
guy
rose
his
face
livid
with
passion
in
a
frame
of
mind
far
from
funny
he
wished
to
annihilate
him
you
ll
pay
for
this
he
screamed
you
ll
repent
it
bitterly
you
poor
nameless
dependent
low
born
very
likely
hold
there
said
hector
advancing
resolutely
and
sternly
facing
the
angry
boy
be
careful
what
you
say
if
this
story
of
your
father
s
is
true
which
i
do
nt
believe
you
might
have
the
decency
to
let
me
alone
even
if
you
do
nt
sympathize
with
me
if
you
dare
to
say
or
hint
anything
against
my
birth
i
ll
treat
you
worse
than
i
have
yet
you
ll
suffer
for
this
almost
shrieked
guy
i
am
ready
to
suffer
now
if
you
are
able
to
make
me
said
hector
come
on
and
we
ll
settle
it
now
but
guy
had
no
desire
for
the
contest
to
which
he
was
invited
he
had
a
wholesome
fear
of
hector
s
strong
muscular
arms
aided
hector
had
never
taken
regular
lessons
but
a
private
tutor
whom
his
father
had
employed
a
graduate
of
yale
had
instructed
him
in
the
rudiments
of
the
manly
art
of
self
defense
and
hector
was
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
himself
against
any
boy
of
his
own
size
and
strength
in
size
guy
was
his
equal
but
in
strength
he
was
quite
inferior
this
guy
knew
full
well
and
angry
as
he
was
he
by
no
means
lost
sight
of
prudence
i
do
nt
choose
to
dirty
my
hands
with
you
he
said
i
shall
tell
my
father
and
it
would
serve
you
right
if
he
sent
you
adrift
in
hector
s
present
mood
he
would
not
perhaps
have
cared
much
if
this
threat
had
been
carried
into
execution
but
he
was
not
altogether
reckless
and
he
felt
that
it
was
best
to
remain
under
mr
roscoe
s
protection
until
he
had
had
time
to
investigate
the
remarkable
story
which
he
own
interests
tell
your
father
if
you
like
said
hector
quietly
i
do
nt
know
whether
he
will
sustain
you
or
not
in
your
insults
but
if
he
does
then
i
shall
have
two
opponents
instead
of
one
does
that
mean
that
you
will
attack
my
father
demanded
guy
hoping
for
an
affirmative
answer
as
it
would
help
him
to
prejudice
his
father
against
our
hero
no
answered
hector
smiling
i
do
nt
apprehend
there
will
be
any
necessity
for
he
wo
nt
insult
me
as
you
have
done
guy
lost
notime
in
seeking
his
father
and
laying
the
matter
before
him
inveighing
against
hector
with
great
bitterness
so
he
knocked
have
been
poets
and
philosophers
we
have
spread
liberty
and
broken
the
chains
of
sin
and
seen
family
life
elevated
and
the
world
regenerated
thank
god
for
such
hours
for
though
they
were
spent
among
ideals
they
belong
to
us
henceforth
and
are
golden
threads
between
this
life
and
a
higher
one
when
foot
in
darkness
trod
when
thick
clouds
dispart
around
thee
and
them
standest
near
to
god
when
a
noble
soul
comes
near
thee
in
whom
kindred
virtues
dwell
that
from
faithless
doubts
can
clear
thee
and
with
strengthening
love
compel
o
these
are
moments
rare
fair
moments
sing
and
shout
and
use
them
well
prof
blackie
richard
was
the
first
to
remember
how
many
little
matters
of
importance
were
to
be
attended
to
the
bishop
sighed
and
looked
at
the
three
young
faces
around
him
perhaps
the
same
thought
was
in
every
heart
though
no
one
liked
to
utter
it
a
kind
of
chill
the
natural
reaction
of
extreme
enthusiasm
was
about
to
fall
upon
them
phyllis
rose
let
us
say
good
night
now
she
said
it
is
so
easy
to
put
it
off
until
we
are
too
tired
to
say
it
bravely
go
to
the
piano
phyllis
we
will
say
it
in
song
and
and
pointed
out
the
hymn
to
richard
and
john
come
we
will
have
a
soldier
s
hymn
two
of
as
grand
verses
as
charles
wesley
ever
wrote
captain
of
israel
s
host
and
guide
of
all
who
seek
the
land
above
beneath
thy
shadow
we
abide
the
cloud
of
thy
protecting
love
our
strength
thy
grace
our
rule
thy
word
our
end
the
glory
of
the
lord
by
thy
unerring
spirit
led
we
shall
not
in
the
desert
stray
we
shall
not
full
direction
need
nor
miss
our
providential
way
as
far
from
danger
as
from
fear
while
love
almighty
love
is
near
the
bishop
and
richard
went
with
john
to
new
orleans
in
the
morning
phyllis
was
glad
to
be
alone
she
had
tried
to
send
her
lover
away
cheerfully
but
there
is
always
the
afterward
the
afterward
to
phyllis
was
an
extreme
sadness
that
was
almost
lethargy
many
crushed
souls
have
these
fits
of
somnolent
depression
and
it
point
out
that
physical
infirmity
is
the
cause
they
know
what
the
sorrowful
sleep
of
the
apostles
in
the
garden
of
olivet
was
and
pity
them
phyllis
wept
slow
heavy
tears
until
she
fell
into
a
deep
slumber
and
she
did
not
awaken
until
harriet
was
spreading
the
cloth
upon
a
small
table
for
her
lunch

and
richard
got
his
letter
but
it
did
not
seem
to
give
him
much
pleasure
phyllis
noticed
that
after
reading
it
he
was
unhappy
and
troubled
he
took
an
hour
s
promenade
on
the
piazza
and
then
sat
down
beside
her
phyllis
he
said
we
have
both
been
unfortunate
in
our
love
you
stooped
too
low
and
i
looked
too
high
john
has
not
money
enough
elizabeth
has
too
much
you
are
wronging
both
elizabeth
and
john
what
has
elizabeth
done
or
said
there
is
a
change
in
her
though
i
can
not
define
it
her
letters
full
of
antony
and
his
wild
ambitious
schemes
they
keep
the
form
but
they
lack
the
spirit
of
her
first
letters
it
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
and
being
rather
tall
and
very
slight
of
figure
the
dress
somewhat
exaggerated
the
ethereal
look
that
was
natural
to
her
she
seemed
cold
and
spread
out
her
delicate
hands
to
the
bright
flame
of
the
blazing
wood
fire
mrs
wyndham
and
pocock
vancouver
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
mrs
wyndham
rose
with
a
cup
other
side
of
the
fireplace
where
sybil
was
sitting
and
offered
it
to
her
poor
sybil
you
are
so
cold
drink
some
tea
the
elder
woman
sat
down
by
the
young
girl
and
lightly
kissed
her
cheek
you
must
not
be
sad
darling
she
whispered
sympathetically
i
am
not
sad
at
all
really
answered
miss
brandon
aloud
quite
naturally
but
pressing
mrs
wyndham
s
hand
a
little
as
though
in
acknowledgment
of
her
sympathy
no
one
can
be
sad
in
boston
said
vancouver
putting
in
a
word
our
city
is
altogether
too
wildly
gay
he
laughed
a
little
you
must
not
make
fun
of
us
to
visitors
mr
vancouver
answered
mrs
wyndham
still
holding
sybil
s
hand
it
is
mr
vancouver
s
ruling
passion
though
he
never
acknowledges
it
said
miss
brandon
calmly
i
remember
it
of
old
i
am
flattered
at
being
remembered
pleasure
nor
interest
however
but
he
continued
i
am
not
particularly
flattered
at
being
called
a
scoffer
at
my
own
people
i
did
not
say
that
interrupted
miss
brandon
well
you
said
my
ruling
passion
was
making
fun
of
boston
to
visitors
at
least
you
and
mrs
wyndham
said
it
between
you
i
really
never
do
that
unless
i
give
the
other
side
of
the
question
as
well
what
other
side
asked
mrs
sam
who
wanted
to
make
conversation
boston
said
vancouver
with
some
solemnity
it
is
not
more
often
ridiculous
than
other
great
institutions
you
simply
take
one
s
breath
away
mr
vancouver
said
mrs
wyndham
with
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
the
idea
of
calling
boston
an
institution
why
certainly
the
united
states
are
only
an
institution
after
all
you
could
not
soberly
call
us
a
nation
even
you
could
not
country
if
your
ancestors
had
signed
twenty
declarations
of
independence
we
live
in
a
great
institution
and
we
have
every
right
to
flatter
ourselves
on
the
success
of
its
management
but
in
the
long
run
this
thing
will
not
do
for
a
nation
miss
brandon
looked
at
vancouver
with
a
sort
of
calm
incredulity
mrs
wyndham
always
quarreled
with
him
on
points
like
the
one
now
raised
and
accordingly
took
up
the
cudgels
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
congratulate
yourself
on
the
management
of
your
institution
as
you
call
it
when
you
know
very
well
you
would
rather
die
than
have
anything
to
do
with
it
very
true
but
then
you
always
say
that
gentlemen
should
not
touch
anything
so
dirty
as
politics
mrs
wyndham
retorted
vancouver
well
that
just
shows
that
it
is
not
an
institution
at
all
and
that
you
are
quite
wrong
and
that
we
are
a
great
nation
supported
and
carried
on
by
real
patriotism
and
the
that
scorn
which
only
the
true
son
of
freedom
can
exhibit
in
speaking
of
his
fellow
citizens
oh
the
irish
vote
that
is
always
the
last
word
in
the
argument
answered
mrs
sam
i
do
not
see
exactly
what
the
irish
have
to
do
with
it
remarked
miss
brandon
innocently
she
did
not
understand
politics
vancouver
glanced
at
the
clock
and
took
his
hat
it
is
very
simple
he
said
rising
to
go
it
is
the
bull
in
the
china
shop
the
irish
bull
amongst
the
american
china
dangerous
you
know
good
evening
mrs
wyndham
good
evening
miss
brandon
and
he
took
his
leave
miss
brandon
watched
his
slim
figure
disappear
through
the
heavy
curtains
of
the
door
he
has
not
changed
much
since
i
knew
him
she
said
turning
again
to
the
fire
i
used
to
think
he
was
clever
and
have
you
changed
your
mind
asked
mrs
wyndham
laughing
he
has
very
good
manners
and
looks
altogether
like
a
gentleman
of
course
said
mrs
wyndham
his
mother
was
a
shaw
although
his
father
came
from
south
carolina
but
he
is
really
very
bright
sam
always
says
he
is
one
of
the
ablest
men
in
boston
in
what
way
inquired
sybil
oh
he
is
a
lawyer
do
nt
you
know
great
railroad
man
oh
ejaculated
miss
brandon
and
relapsed
into
silence
mrs
wyndham
rose
and
stood
before
the
fire
and
pushed
a
log
back
with
her
small
foot
miss
brandon
watched
her
half
wondering
whether
the
flames
would
not
catch
her
dress
i
have
been
to
see
that
miss
thorn
said
sybil
presently
oh
exclaimed
mrs
sam
with
sudden
interest
tell
me
all
about
her
this
minute
dear
is
not
she
the
most
extraordinary
creature
i
rather
like
her
answered
miss
what
style
dark
no
not
exactly
brown
hair
and
lots
of
eyebrows
she
is
a
little
thing
but
very
much
alive
you
know
awfully
english
of
course
suggested
mrs
sam
well
yes
i
suppose
so
she
is
wild
about
horses
and
says
she
shoots
but
i
like
her
i
am
sure
i
shall
like
her
very
much
she
does
not
seem
very
pleased
with
her
aunt
i
do
not
wonder
said
mrs
sam
poor
little
thing
she
has
nobody
else
belonging
to
her
has
she
oh
yes
answered
sybil
with
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
she
has
a
mother
in
england
i
want
to
see
her
ever
so
much
said
mrs
sam
bring
her
to
luncheon
you
will
see
her
to
night
i
think
she
said
she
was
going
to
that
party
i
hate
to
leave
you
alone
had
better
not
go
dear
mrs
wyndham
said
sybil
rising
and
laying
her
hands
on
her
hostess
s
shoulders
half
affectionately
half
in
protest
this
idea
must
be
stopped
from
the
first
and
i
mean
to
stop
it
you
are
not
to
give
up
any
party
or
any
society
or
anything
at
all
for
me
in
a
soft
flat
and
yet
agreeable
voice
by
the
time
she
had
finished
she
was
blushing
i
complimented
her
and
told
her
she
was
perfectly
equipped
for
visiting
switzerland
and
italy
she
looked
at
me
askance
again
to
see
whether
i
was
serious
and
i
added
that
if
she
wished
to
recognize
byron
s
descriptions
she
must
go
abroad
speedily
europe
was
getting
sadly
dis
byronized
how
soon
must
i
go
she
asked
oh
i
will
give
you
ten
years
i
think
i
can
go
within
ten
years
she
answered
very
soberly
well
i
said
you
will
enjoy
it
immensely
you
will
find
it
very
charming
and
just
then
i
came
which
i
had
been
very
fond
of
and
which
recalled
tender
memories
i
discoursed
as
i
suppose
with
a
certain
eloquence
my
companion
sat
listening
breathless
have
you
been
very
long
in
foreign
lands
she
asked
some
time
after
i
had
ceased
many
years
i
said
and
have
you
travelled
everywhere
i
have
travelled
a
great
deal
i
am
very
fond
of
it
and
happily
i
have
been
able
again
she
gave
me
her
sidelong
gaze
and
do
you
know
the
foreign
languages
after
a
fashion
is
it
hard
to
speak
them
i
do
nt
believe
you
would
find
it
hard
i
gallantly
responded
oh
i
should
nt
want
to
speak
i
should
only
want
to
listen
she
said
then
after
a
pause
she
added
they
say
the
french
theatre
is
so
beautiful
it
is
the
best
in
often
when
i
was
first
in
paris
i
went
every
night
every
night
and
she
opened
her
clear
eyes
very
wide
that
to
me
is
and
she
hesitated
a
moment
is
very
wonderful
a
few
minutes
later
she
asked
which
country
do
you
prefer
there
is
one
country
i
prefer
to
all
others
i
think
you
would
do
the
same
she
looked
at
me
a
moment
and
then
she
said
softly
italy
italy
i
answered
softly
too
and
for
a
moment
we
looked
at
each
other
she
looked
as
pretty
as
if
instead
of
showing
her
photographs
i
had
been
making
love
to
her
to
increase
the
analogy
she
glanced
away
blushing
there
was
a
silence
which
she
broke
at
last
by
saying
that
is
the
place
which
in
particular
i
thought
of
going
to
oh
that
s
the
place
she
looked
at
two
or
three
photographs
in
silence
they
say
it
is
not
so
dear
as
some
other
countries
yes
that
is
not
the
least
of
its
charms
but
it
is
all
very
dear
is
it
not
europe
you
mean
going
there
and
travelling
that
has
been
the
trouble
i
have
very
little
money
i
give
lessons
said
miss
spencer
of
course
one
must
have
money
i
said
but
one
can
manage
with
a
moderate
amount
i
think
i
should
manage
i
have
laid
something
by
and
i
am
always
adding
a
little
to
it
it
s
all
for
that
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
with
a
kind
of
suppressed
eagerness
as
if
telling
me
the
story
were
a
rare
but
a
possibly
impure
satisfaction
but
it
has
not
been
only
the
money
it
has
been
everything
everything
has
been
against
it
i
castle
in
the
air
i
am
almost
afraid
to
talk
about
it
two
or
three
times
it
has
been
a
little
nearer
and
then
i
have
talked
about
it
and
it
has
melted
away
i
have
talked
about
it
too
much
she
said
hypocritically
for
i
saw
that
such
talking
was
now
a
small
tremulous
ecstasy
there
is
a
lady
who
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
she
does
nt
want
to
go
i
always
talk
to
her
about
it
i
tire
her
dreadfully
she
told
me
once
she
did
nt
know
what
would
become
of
me
i
should
go
crazy
if
i
did
not
go
to
europe
and
i
should
certainly
go
crazy
if
i
did
well
i
said
you
have
not
gone
yet
and
nevertheless
you
are
not
crazy
she
looked
at
me
a
moment
and
said
i
am
not
so
sure
i
do
nt
think
of
anything
else
i
am
always
thinking
of
it
it
prevents
me
that
i
ought
to
attend
to
that
is
a
kind
of
craziness
the
cure
for
it
is
to
go
i
said
i
have
a
faith
that
i
shall
go
i
have
a
cousin
in
europe
she
announced
we
turned
over
some
more
photographs
and
i
asked
her
if
she
had
always
lived
at
grimwinter
oh
no
sir
said
miss
spencer
i
have
spent
twenty
three
months
in
boston
i
answered
jocosely
that
in
that
case
foreign
lands
would
probably
prove
a
disappointment
to
her
but
i
quite
failed
to
alarm
her
i
know
more
about
them
than
you
might
think
she
said
with
her
shy
neat
little
smile
i
mean
by
reading
i
have
read
a
great
deal
i
have
not
only
read
byron
i
have
read
histories
and
guidebooks
i
know
i
shall
like
it
i
understand
your
case
i
rejoined
you
have
the
native
american
passion
i
think
it
is
primordial
antecedent
to
experience
experience
comes
and
only
shows
us
something
we
have
dreamt
of
i
think
that
is
very
true
said
caroline
spencer
i
have
dreamt
of
everything
i
shall
know
it
all
i
am
afraid
you
have
wasted
a
great
deal
of
time
oh
yes
that
has
been
my
great
wickedness
the
people
about
us
had
begun
to
scatter
they
were
taking
their
leave
she
got
up
and
put
out
her
hand
to
me
timidly
but
with
a
peculiar
brightness
in
her
eyes
i
am
going
back
there
i
said
as
i
shook
hands
with
her
i
shall
look
out
for
you
i
will
tell
you
she
answered
if
i
am
disappointed
and
she
went
away
looking
delicately
agitated
and
moving
her
little
straw
fan
ii
a
few
months
after
this
i
returned
to
europe
and
some
three
years
elapsed
toward
the
end
of
october
i
went
from
that
your
father
if
you
expect
your
husband
to
be
good
miss
lawton
then
mine
will
never
behave
for
papa
is
perfectly
incorrigible
mrs
curwen
i
m
sorry
to
hear
such
a
bad
report
of
him
should
nt
you
think
he
would
be
good
i
should
think
he
would
try
mrs
curwen
a
diplomat
as
well
as
a
punster
already
i
must
warn
miss
lawton
mrs
crashaw
interposing
to
spare
the
young
people
what
an
amusing
thing
elevator
etiquette
is
why
should
the
gentlemen
take
their
hats
off
why
do
nt
you
take
your
hats
off
in
a
horse
car
miller
the
theory
is
that
the
elevator
is
a
room
young
mr
bemis
we
were
at
a
hotel
in
london
where
they
called
it
the
ascending
room
miss
lawton
oh
how
amusing
miller
looking
about
this
is
a
regular
drawing
room
for
size
and
luxury
they
re
usually
such
cribs
in
these
hotels
mrs
crashaw
yes
it
s
very
nice
though
i
say
it
that
should
nt
of
my
niece
s
elevator
the
worst
about
it
is
it
s
so
slow
miller
let
s
hope
it
s
sure
elevators
in
america
go
up
like
express
trains
mrs
curwen
drawing
her
shawl
about
her
shoulders
as
if
to
be
ready
to
step
out
well
i
never
get
into
one
without
taking
my
life
in
my
hand
and
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
suppose
every
one
really
expects
an
elevator
to
drop
with
them
some
day
just
as
everybody
really
expects
to
see
a
ghost
some
time
mrs
crashaw
oh
my
dear
what
an
extremely
disagreeable
subject
of
conversation
mrs
curwen
i
ca
nt
help
it
mrs
crashaw
when
i
reflect
that
there
are
two
thousand
elevators
in
boston
and
that
the
inspectors
have
just
pronounced
a
hundred
and
seventy
of
them
unsafe
i
m
so
desperate
when
i
get
into
one
that
i
could
flirt
miller
guarding
himself
with
the
fan
not
with
me
miss
lawton
to
young
mr
bemis
how
it
does
creep
young
mr
bemis
it
mrs
crashaw
why
it
does
nt
go
at
all
it
s
stopped
let
us
get
out
they
all
rise
the
elevator
boy
pulling
at
the
rope
we
re
not
there
yet
mrs
crashaw
with
mingled
trepidation
and
severity
not
there
what
are
you
stopping
then
for
the
elevator
boy
i
do
nt
know
it
seems
to
be
caught
mrs
crashaw
caught
miss
lawton
oh
dear
young
mr
bemis
do
nt
mind
miller
caught
nonsense
mrs
curwen
we
re
caught
i
should
say
she
sinks
back
on
the
seat
the
elevator
boy
seemed
to
be
going
kind
of
funny
all
day
he
keeps
tugging
at
the
rope
miller
arresting
the
boy
s
efforts
well
hold
on
stop
what
are
you
doing
the
miller
well
do
nt
be
so
violent
about
it
you
might
break
something
the
elevator
boy
break
a
wire
rope
like
that
miller
well
well
be
quiet
now
ladies
i
think
you
d
better
sit
down
and
as
gently
as
possible
i
would
nt
move
about
much
mrs
curwen
move
we
re
stone
and
i
wish
for
my
part
i
were
a
feather
miller
to
the
boy
er
a
er
where
do
you
suppose
we
are
the
elevator
boy
we
re
in
the
shaft
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
floors
he
attempts
a
fresh
demonstration
on
the
rope
but
is
prevented
miller
hold
on
er
er
mrs
crashaw
as
if
the
boy
had
to
be
communicated
with
through
an
interpreter
ask
him
if
it
s
ever
happened
before
miller
yes
were
you
ever
caught
before
the
elevator
boy
no
crashaw
ask
him
if
the
elevator
has
a
safety
device
miller
has
it
got
a
safety
device
the
elevator
boy
how
should
i
know
miller
he
says
he
do
nt
know
mrs
curwen
in
a
shriek
of
hysterical
laughter
why
he
understands
english
mrs
crashaw
sternly
ignoring
the
insinuation
ask
him
if
there
s
any
means
of
calling
the
janitor
miller
could
you
call
the
janitor
the
elevator
boy
ironically
well
there
ai
nt
any
telephone
attachment
miller
solemnly
no
he
says
there
is
nt
mrs
crashaw
sinking
back
on
the
seat
with
resignation
well
i
do
nt
know
what
my
niece
will
say
miss
lawton
poor
papa
young
mr
bemis
gathering
one
of
her
wandering
hands
into
his
do
nt
be
frightened
i
m
sure
there
s
no
danger
she
ca
nt
drop
the
cogs
in
the
runs
wo
nt
let
her
all
oh
miller
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
knew
there
must
be
something
of
the
kind
well
i
wish
my
wife
had
her
fan
mrs
curwen
and
if
i
had
my
left
glove
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
not
that
i
know
what
the
cogs
in
the
runs
are
mrs
crashaw
then
we
re
merely
caught
here
miller
that
s
all
mrs
curwen
it
s
quite
enough
for
the
purpose
could
nt
you
put
on
a
life
preserver
mr
miller
and
go
ashore
and
get
help
from
the
natives
miss
lawton
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
oh
dear
mrs
crashaw
putting
her
arm
around
her
do
nt
be
frightened
my
child
there
s
no
danger
young
mr
bemis
caressing
the
hand
which
he
lawton
do
nt
leave
me
young
mr
bemis
no
no
i
wo
nt
keep
fast
hold
of
my
hand
miss
lawton
oh
yes
i
will
i
m
ashamed
to
cry
young
mr
bemis
fervently
oh
you
need
nt
be
it
is
perfectly
natural
you
should
mrs
curwen
i
m
too
badly
scared
for
tears
mr
miller
you
seem
to
be
in
charge
of
this
expedition
could
nt
you
do
something
throw
out
ballast
or
let
the
boy
down
in
a
parachute
or
i
ve
read
of
a
shipwreck
where
the
survivors
in
an
open
boat
joined
in
a
cry
and
attracted
the
notice
of
a
vessel
that
was
going
to
pass
them
we
might
join
in
a
cry
miller
oh
it
s
all
very
well
joking
mrs
curwen
mrs
curwen
you
call
it
joking
miller
nor
your
brain
conceive
the
sufferings
that
i
have
seen
among
our
people
in
the
long
bitter
winters
with
only
the
snow
for
wrappers
and
pieces
of
dried
skins
for
food
will
the
white
man
die
of
hunger
while
food
is
within
his
reach
no
he
will
beg
it
first
and
then
he
will
take
by
violence
but
i
have
seen
the
young
maiden
and
the
withered
crone
gasp
their
last
breath
away
upon
the
snow
while
ranches
teeming
with
cattle
lay
not
an
hour
s
march
away
if
an
indian
with
a
wife
and
a
lodge
full
of
children
dying
on
a
bitter
winter
s
day
of
hunger
turn
a
calf
from
some
nigh
herd
of
white
man
s
cattle
alarming
tidings
fly
to
the
east
and
white
men
and
women
learn
in
their
sumptuous
houses
would
have
no
need
i
repeat
to
lay
hands
upon
the
ranchers
cattle
if
the
white
man
had
not
come
and
stripped
them
of
their
boundless
heritage
and
put
them
upon
reservations
where
a
buffalo
may
never
come
footnote
the
words
in
the
mouth
of
this
chief
are
not
exaggerations
and
it
is
god
s
own
truth
that
during
late
winters
dozen
after
dozen
of
indians
men
and
women
and
children
perished
in
the
snow
after
they
had
devoured
the
skins
that
covered
them
yet
these
poor
people
are
said
to
be
under
the
paternal
care
of
government
alas
our
public
men
are
only
concerned
in
playing
their
wretched
political
game
and
they
sit
intriguing
while
the
helpless
creatures
committed
to
their
care
perish
like
dogs
of
hunger
in
their
lodges
e
c
and
some
of
the
soldiers
who
have
come
here
from
the
east
are
more
bent
on
earning
reputation
than
on
making
peace
some
of
their
leaders
do
not
want
the
cheap
glory
of
killing
a
lot
ears
heard
one
of
the
ontario
magistrates
col
denison
declare
that
he
did
next
come
here
to
kill
but
to
prevent
killing
if
military
affairs
were
now
to
be
given
into
the
hands
of
some
men
like
him
it
would
prove
better
for
all
concerned
but
there
is
another
officer
major
beaver
who
has
made
amazing
marches
his
men
in
fact
have
travelled
like
march
hares
but
give
me
a
bluff
and
fifty
braves
and
not
one
of
all
his
rash
and
rushing
followers
will
get
back
again
to
ontario
to
boast
of
their
deeds
of
daring
some
of
our
men
have
been
guilty
of
excesses
but
government
gave
them
its
solemn
pledge
that
if
they
returned
to
their
reserves
no
harm
should
come
to
them
all
of
my
braves
have
gone
back
because
i
gave
them
the
assurance
that
some
of
the
officers
gave
to
me
yet
if
i
mistake
not
major
beaver
is
at
this
moment
planning
an
attack
upon
us
his
young
men
want
to
done
without
any
risk
and
then
they
will
be
described
as
great
heroes
in
the
newspapers
they
would
fare
very
badly
if
they
had
to
return
without
having
a
brush
as
the
more
war
like
of
them
have
put
it
in
the
hearing
of
some
of
my
friends
yes
mon
chef
annette
replied
but
you
say
that
colonel
denison
and
others
advocate
a
healing
of
the
present
sores
and
pacific
measures
then
there
are
others
who
have
always
sympathized
with
the
indian
like
mr
mair
mon
pere
tells
me
that
he
has
been
for
some
time
engaged
on
a
beautiful
poem
intended
to
show
the
injustice
that
has
been
heaped
upon
the
children
of
the
plains
with
good
counsels
like
these
surely
no
outrage
will
be
done
unto
your
people
and
now
where
do
the
two
brave
scouts
purpose
going
the
chief
enquired
as
they
came
in
sight
of
a
small
settlement
nestling
around
the
edge
of
a
coil
in
the
saskatchewan
annette
coming
with
her
they
would
remain
there
for
a
day
or
two
to
rest
and
then
they
would
go
wherever
their
services
were
needed
most
oh
not
to
mademoiselle
s
aunt
s
le
grand
chef
and
his
followers
have
twice
been
there
looking
for
the
scouts
and
he
has
spies
among
the
neutral
braves
who
would
speedily
bring
him
the
news
of
your
arrival
then
what
would
the
chief
advise
our
hampers
are
exhausted
now
and
we
must
replenish
them
the
chief
would
go
after
the
gopher
had
sought
his
burrow
and
fetch
all
that
the
maidens
needed
beyond
a
wooded
knoll
plain
to
the
view
was
a
lake
and
in
the
wood
skirting
the
water
would
be
a
suitable
camping
ground
the
chief
advised
the
maidens
to
ride
thither
as
they
must
now
be
tired
and
hungry
he
would
fetch
them
the
provisions
and
other
things
needed
when
the
stars
came
out
annette
then
scribbled
a
note
to
her
aunt
and
mentioned
those
little
things
gratitude
to
sa
tante
for
her
kindness
and
made
her
love
and
duties
as
girls
of
her
race
do
with
such
grace
and
the
chief
was
away
is
julie
very
tired
pas
beaucoup
mademoiselle
if
you
want
not
to
pitch
tent
now
i
should
be
well
able
to
ride
for
a
couple
of
hours
yet
i
want
to
hear
what
tidings
there
may
be
of
captain
stephens
julie
and
her
voice
trembled
a
little
i
do
not
think
that
the
braves
who
go
in
and
out
of
the
village
can
all
be
hostile
those
who
are
up
to
mischief
have
their
paint
on
turning
their
horses
towards
the
village
they
perceived
two
braves
riding
towards
them
i
think
i
know
one
of
these
julie
is
not
the
taller
one
he
who
brought
us
the
proclamation
of
le
grand
chef
oh
yes
the
very
one
how
quick
ma
maitresse
is
in
remembering
persons
the
indian
rode
drew
near
he
raised
his
hand
it
is
not
safe
down
here
he
said
in
cree
for
the
scouts
a
runner
from
the
stonies
saw
you
both
and
little
poplar
with
you
this
morning
and
swiftly
carried
the
news
it
is
likely
was
on
his
way
to
the
canada
land
company
s
reserve
in
the
huron
district
had
brought
him
letters
from
york
among
which
he
added
was
one
from
his
old
friend
allan
dunlop
condoling
with
him
on
the
loss
of
and
his
family
how
curious
observed
helene
why
we
ve
just
been
talking
of
mr
dunlop
you
mean
to
say
interposed
rose
that
you
have
just
been
talking
of
him
well
that
is
quite
a
coincidence
miss
deberczy
but
do
you
know
my
friend
asked
edward
no
i
ve
not
that
pleasure
replied
the
beautiful
huguenot
but
your
sister
i
believe
knows
him
oh
helene
i
do
not
said
rose
interruptingly
edward
turned
towards
his
sister
and
for
a
moment
regarded
her
lovingly
after
a
pause
he
said
well
sis
if
you
do
know
him
you
know
one
of
the
best
and
most
promising
of
my
early
acquaintances
and
from
what
i
have
heard
of
him
since
my
return
i
feel
that
i
want
to
improve
my
own
acquaintance
with
him
and
shall
not
be
sorry
to
know
that
he
has
become
edward
you
must
wait
till
i
do
know
him
said
rose
with
some
emphasis
i
know
your
friend
by
sight
only
and
have
never
spoken
to
him
though
i
confess
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
of
him
in
the
recent
election
and
much
that
is
favourable
though
papa
has
taken
a
great
dislike
to
him
on
account
of
his
political
opinions
ah
papa
s
tory
prejudices
would
be
sure
to
do
injustice
to
dunlop
edward
rejoined
but
i
fear
he
added
there
is
need
in
the
political
arena
of
upper
canada
of
just
such
a
reformer
as
he
at
this
stage
of
the
conversation
the
old
commodore
was
observed
on
the
veranda
and
tredway
approached
the
group
to
announce
that
lunch
was
on
the
table
commodore
macleod
as
may
be
inferred
from
his
son
s
remark
about
his
father
s
tory
prejudices
was
a
tory
of
the
old
school
a
member
of
the
legislative
council
of
upper
canada
provincial
executive
who
had
earned
for
themselves
by
their
autocratic
rule
the
rather
sinister
designation
of
the
family
compact
as
a
trusted
friend
and
loyal
supporter
of
the
oligarchy
of
the
day
whom
a
well
known
radical
who
figured
prominently
in
the
later
history
of
the
province
was
wont
to
speak
of
as
that
army
of
placemen
and
pensioners
paymasters
receivers
auditors
king
lords
and
commons
who
swallowed
the
whole
revenue
of
upper
canada
the
reference
to
a
man
of
the
type
of
young
dunlop
who
aspired
to
political
honours
was
particularly
distasteful
and
sure
to
bring
upon
the
object
of
his
bitter
animadversion
the
full
vials
of
his
wrath
ralph
macleod
was
a
grand
specimen
of
the
sturdy
british
seamen
who
contributed
by
their
prowess
to
make
england
mistress
of
the
seas
he
entered
the
navy
during
the
war
with
holland
and
served
under
lord
howe
when
that
old
sea
dog
in
came
to
the
relief
of
gibraltar
against
the
combined
forces
of
in
the
west
indies
and
was
a
shipmate
of
nelson
s
in
sir
john
jervis
victory
over
the
spanish
fleet
off
cape
st
vincent
for
his
share
in
that
action
macleod
gained
his
captaincy
while
his
friend
commodore
nelson
was
made
a
rear
admiral
in
he
was
wounded
at
camperdown
while
serving
under
admiral
duncan
and
retired
with
the
rank
of
commodore
early
in
the
century
he
married
an
english
lady
and
came
to
canada
where
for
a
time
he
held
various
posts
on
the
naval
stations
on
the
lakes
and
was
with
barclay
on
his
flagship
the
detroit
in
the
disaster
on
lake
erie
in
september
narrowly
escaping
capture
by
commander
perry
s
forces
at
put
in
bay
he
joined
general
proctor
in
his
retreat
from
amherstburg
to
the
thames
and
was
present
at
the
battle
of
moravian
town
where
the
indian
chief
tecumseh
lost
his
life
when
the
treaty
of
ghent
terminated
the
war
and
left
canada
in
possession
of
her
own
commodore
macleod
with
and
took
grants
of
land
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lake
simcoe
being
possessed
of
considerable
private
means
the
commodore
built
a
palatial
residence
on
the
borders
of
that
lake
and
varied
the
monotony
of
a
life
ashore
by
an
engrossing
interest
in
politics
and
the
active
duties
of
a
legislative
councillor
the
illness
of
his
wife
to
whom
he
was
devoted
had
in
the
past
two
years
almost
entirely
withdrawn
him
from
political
life
and
lost
to
his
colleagues
in
the
upper
house
the
services
of
one
who
took
grim
pleasure
in
strangling
bills
obnoxious
to
the
dominant
faction
which
originated
in
the
lower
chamber
his
temporary
withdrawal
from
the
legislative
council
and
the
lengthened
absence
in
england
of
dr
strachan
that
sturdy
ecclesiastic
who
was
long
the
ruling
spirit
of
the
family
compact
emboldened
the
leaders
of
reform
to
inveigh
against
the
hydra
headed
abuses
of
the
time
and
sow
broadcast
the
dragon
teeth
of
discontent
and
the
seeds
of
a
speedy
harvest
of
sedition
already
wm
lyon
mackenzie
had
unfolded
in
the
lively
of
grievances
while
the
harsh
operations
of
the
alien
act
the
interdicting
of
immigrants
from
the
united
states
the
arrogant
claims
of
the
anglican
church
to
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
clergy
reserves
and
the
jobbery
and
corruption
that
prevailed
in
the
land
granting
department
of
the
government
all
contributed
to
fan
the
flame
of
discontent
and
sap
the
loyalty
of
the
colony
in
the
legislative
assembly
each
recurring
session
added
to
the
clamour
of
opposition
and
emphasized
the
demand
for
responsible
government
and
popular
rights
but
as
yet
such
demands
were
looked
upon
as
the
ravings
of
lunacy
or
the
impertinences
of
treason
constitutional
government
even
in
the
mother
land
was
not
yet
fully
attained
and
in
a
distant
dependency
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
or
the
rights
and
privileges
of
its
nominee
an
irresponsible
executive
were
to
be
made
subordinate
to
the
will
of
cards
by
the
porter
the
moment
they
find
army
ladies
are
on
the
train
i
do
nt
understand
this
one
at
all
especially
but
here
she
broke
off
abruptly
especially
what
asked
miss
nell
with
an
inspiration
of
maidenly
curiosity
especially
nothing
never
mind
now
and
here
the
baby
began
to
fidget
and
stir
about
and
stretch
forth
his
chubby
hands
and
thrust
his
knuckles
in
his
eyes
and
pucker
up
his
face
in
alarming
contortions
preparatory
to
a
wail
and
after
one
or
two
soothing
and
tentative
sounds
of
sh
sh
sh
sh
from
the
maternal
lips
the
matron
abandoned
him
up
in
her
arms
where
he
presently
began
to
take
gracious
notice
of
his
pretty
aunt
and
the
kitten
two
hours
later
just
as
the
porter
had
notified
them
that
warrener
station
would
be
in
sight
in
five
minutes
the
young
man
of
the
opposite
section
returned
to
the
car
he
looked
tired
very
anxious
and
his
face
was
paler
and
the
sad
expression
more
pronounced
than
before
the
train
conductor
stopped
him
to
speak
of
some
telegrams
that
had
been
sent
and
both
ladies
noted
the
respect
which
the
railway
official
threw
into
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
the
card
players
stopped
their
game
and
went
up
to
ask
after
the
frozen
men
it
was
not
until
the
whistle
was
sounding
for
the
station
that
he
stood
before
them
and
with
a
grave
and
courteous
bow
held
forth
mrs
rayner
s
silver
flask
it
was
a
blessing
to
one
poor
fellow
at
least
and
i
thank
you
for
him
madame
he
said
i
have
been
so
anxious
i
wanted
to
mr
she
asked
with
intentional
pause
that
he
might
supply
the
missing
name
indeed
there
was
nothing
we
could
ask
of
you
he
answered
totally
ignoring
the
evident
invitation
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
but
we
had
abundant
help
and
you
really
could
not
have
reached
the
car
in
the
face
of
this
gale
good
morning
madame
and
with
that
he
raised
his
fur
travelling
cap
and
quickly
turned
to
his
section
and
busied
himself
strapping
up
his
various
belongings
the
man
must
be
a
woman
hater
she
whispered
to
miss
travers
he
s
going
to
get
out
here
too
who
can
he
be
there
was
still
a
moment
before
the
train
would
stop
at
the
platform
and
she
was
not
to
be
beaten
so
easily
bending
partly
across
the
aisle
she
spoke
again
you
have
been
so
kind
to
those
poor
fellows
that
i
feel
sure
you
must
be
of
the
army
i
think
i
told
you
we
not
hope
to
see
you
there
a
deep
flush
rose
to
his
forehead
suffusing
his
cheeks
and
passed
as
quickly
away
his
mouth
twitched
and
trembled
gazing
at
him
in
surprise
and
trouble
nellie
travers
saw
that
his
face
was
full
of
pain
and
was
turning
white
again
he
half
choked
before
he
could
reply
he
spoke
low
and
yet
distinctly
and
the
words
were
full
of
sadness
it
it
is
not
probable
that
we
shall
meet
at
all
and
with
that
he
turned
away
ii
even
in
the
excitement
attendant
upon
their
reception
at
the
station
neither
mrs
rayner
nor
her
sister
could
entirely
recover
from
the
surprise
and
pain
which
the
stranger
s
singular
words
had
caused
so
far
from
feeling
in
the
least
rebuffed
mrs
rayner
well
understood
from
his
manner
that
not
the
faintest
discourtesy
was
intended
there
was
not
a
symptom
of
rudeness
not
a
vestige
of
irritation
or
haste
in
his
tone
deep
embarrassment
inexpressible
sadness
even
she
read
in
it
was
all
a
mystery
to
her
and
to
the
girl
seated
in
silence
by
her
side
both
followed
him
with
their
eyes
as
he
hurried
away
to
the
rear
of
the
car
and
then
with
joyous
shouts
three
or
four
burly
fur
enveloped
men
came
bursting
in
the
front
door
and
the
two
ladies
the
baby
and
the
kitten
were
pounced
upon
and
surrounded
by
a
group
that
grew
larger
every
minute
released
finally
from
the
welcoming
embrace
of
her
stalwart
husband
mrs
rayner
found
time
to
present
the
other
and
younger
officers
to
her
sister
as
many
as
half
a
dozen
had
followed
the
captain
in
his
wild
rush
upon
the
car
and
while
he
and
his
baby
boy
were
resuming
acquaintanceship
after
a
separation
of
many
long
months
miss
travers
found
herself
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
young
officers
who
had
braved
the
wintry
blizzard
in
their
eagerness
to
do
her
proper
homage
her
cheeks
were
aflame
with
excitement
and
pleasure
her
eyes
dancing
and
despite
the
fatigue
of
her
long
glanced
for
a
moment
from
the
baby
s
wondering
eyes
took
in
the
picture
like
an
instantaneous
photograph
and
then
looked
again
into
mrs
rayner
s
smiling
face
you
were
wise
in
providing
against
possibilities
as
you
did
kate
he
said
with
a
significant
nod
of
the
head
there
are
as
many
as
a
dozen
of
them
or
at
least
there
will
be
when
the
th
gets
back
from
the
field
stannard
is
out
yet
with
his
battalion
oh
yes
we
saw
them
at
a
station
east
of
here
they
looked
frozen
to
death
and
there
are
ever
so
many
of
the
soldiers
frozen
the
baggage
car
is
full
of
them
did
nt
you
know
it
not
a
word
of
it
we
have
been
here
for
three
mortal
hours
waiting
at
the
station
and
any
telegrams
must
have
been
sent
right
out
to
the
fort
the
colonel
is
there
and
he
would
have
all
arrangements
made
here
graham
foster
mrs
in
the
baggage
car
run
ahead
and
see
what
is
necessary
will
you
i
ll
be
there
in
a
minute
as
soon
as
we
ve
got
these
ladies
off
the
train
two
of
the
young
gentlemen
who
had
been
hovering
around
miss
travers
took
themselves
off
without
a
moment
s
delay
the
others
remained
to
help
their
senior
officer
out
into
the
it
thoroughly
illuminated
the
dense
medium
of
cloud
betwixt
the
sky
and
earth
the
great
vault
brightened
like
the
dome
of
an
immense
lamp
it
showed
the
familiar
scene
of
the
street
with
the
distinctness
of
midday
but
also
with
the
awfulness
that
is
always
imparted
to
familiar
objects
by
an
unaccustomed
light
the
wooden
houses
with
their
jutting
stories
and
quaint
gable
peaks
the
doorsteps
and
thresholds
with
the
early
grass
springing
up
about
them
the
garden
plots
black
with
freshly
turned
earth
the
wheel
track
little
worn
and
even
in
the
marketplace
margined
with
green
on
either
side
all
were
visible
but
with
a
singularity
of
aspect
that
seemed
to
give
another
moral
interpretation
to
the
things
of
this
world
than
they
had
ever
borne
hand
over
his
heart
and
hester
prynne
with
the
embroidered
letter
glimmering
on
her
bosom
and
little
pearl
herself
a
symbol
and
the
connecting
link
between
these
two
they
stood
in
the
noon
of
that
strange
and
solemn
splendour
as
if
it
were
the
light
that
is
to
reveal
all
secrets
and
the
daybreak
that
shall
unite
all
that
belong
to
one
another
that
is
imaginative
impressive
poetic
but
when
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
author
goes
on
to
say
that
the
minister
looking
upward
to
the
zenith
beheld
there
the
appearance
of
an
immense
letter
the
letter
a
marked
out
in
lines
of
dull
red
light
we
feel
that
he
goes
too
far
and
is
in
danger
of
crossing
the
line
that
separates
the
sublime
from
its
intimate
neighbour
we
are
tempted
to
say
that
this
is
not
moral
tragedy
but
physical
comedy
in
the
same
way
too
much
is
made
of
the
intimation
that
hester
s
badge
had
a
scorching
property
and
that
if
one
touched
it
one
would
for
images
which
shall
place
themselves
in
picturesque
correspondence
with
the
spiritual
facts
with
which
he
is
concerned
and
of
course
the
search
is
of
the
very
essence
of
poetry
but
in
such
a
process
discretion
is
everything
and
when
the
image
becomes
importunate
it
is
in
danger
of
seeming
to
stand
for
nothing
more
serious
than
itself
when
hester
meets
the
minister
by
appointment
in
the
forest
and
sits
talking
with
him
while
little
pearl
wanders
away
and
plays
by
the
edge
of
the
brook
the
child
is
represented
as
at
last
making
her
way
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
woodland
stream
and
disporting
herself
there
in
a
manner
which
makes
her
mother
feel
herself
in
some
indistinct
and
tantalising
manner
estranged
from
pearl
as
if
the
child
in
her
lonely
ramble
through
the
forest
had
strayed
out
of
the
sphere
in
which
she
and
her
mother
dwelt
together
and
was
now
vainly
seeking
to
return
to
it
and
hawthorne
devotes
a
chapter
to
this
idea
of
the
child
s
having
a
kind
of
spiritual
gulf
on
the
verge
of
which
her
little
fantastic
person
innocently
mocks
at
her
mother
s
sense
of
bereavement
this
conception
belongs
one
would
say
quite
to
the
lighter
order
of
a
story
teller
s
devices
and
the
reader
hardly
goes
with
hawthorne
in
the
large
development
he
gives
to
it
he
hardly
goes
with
him
either
i
think
in
his
extreme
predilection
for
a
small
number
of
vague
ideas
which
are
represented
by
such
terms
as
sphere
and
sympathies
hawthorne
makes
too
liberal
a
use
of
these
two
substantives
it
is
the
solitary
defect
of
his
style
and
it
counts
as
a
defect
partly
because
the
words
in
question
are
a
sort
of
specialty
with
certain
writers
immeasurably
inferior
to
himself
i
had
not
meant
however
to
expatiate
upon
his
defects
which
are
of
the
slenderest
and
most
venial
kind
the
scarlet
letter
has
the
beauty
and
harmony
of
all
original
and
complete
conceptions
and
its
weaker
spots
whatever
they
are
are
not
of
of
surface
one
can
often
return
to
it
it
supports
familiarity
and
has
the
inexhaustible
charm
and
mystery
of
great
works
of
art
it
is
admirably
written
hawthorne
afterwards
polished
his
style
to
a
still
higher
degree
but
in
his
later
productions
it
is
almost
always
the
case
in
a
writer
s
later
productions
there
is
a
touch
of
mannerism
in
the
scarlet
letter
there
is
a
high
degree
of
polish
and
at
the
same
time
a
charming
freshness
his
phrase
is
less
conscious
of
itself
his
biographer
very
justly
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
style
was
excellent
from
the
beginning
that
he
appeared
to
have
passed
through
no
phase
of
learning
how
to
write
but
was
in
possession
of
his
means
from
the
first
of
his
handling
a
pen
his
early
tales
perhaps
were
not
of
a
character
to
subject
his
faculty
of
expression
to
a
very
severe
test
but
a
man
who
had
not
hawthorne
s
natural
sense
of
language
would
certainly
have
contrived
to
write
them
less
well
this
natural
sense
of
picturesquely
yet
simply
and
for
infusing
a
gently
colloquial
tone
into
matter
of
the
most
unfamiliar
import
he
had
evidently
cultivated
with
great
assiduity
i
have
spoken
of
the
anomalous
character
of
his
note
books
of
his
going
to
such
pains
often
to
make
a
record
of
incidents
which
either
were
not
worth
remembering
or
could
be
easily
remembered
without
its
aid
but
it
helps
us
to
understand
the
note
books
if
we
regard
them
as
a
literary
exercise
they
were
compositions
as
school
boys
say
in
which
the
subject
was
only
the
pretext
and
the
main
point
was
to
write
a
certain
amount
of
excellent
english
hawthorne
must
at
least
have
written
a
great
many
of
these
things
for
practice
and
he
must
often
have
said
to
himself
that
it
was
better
practice
to
write
about
trifles
because
it
was
a
greater
tax
upon
one
s
skill
to
make
them
interesting
and
his
theory
was
just
for
he
has
almost
always
made
his
trifles
interesting
in
his
novels
his
art
of
saying
things
well
is
very
positively
tested
is
very
easy
for
much
dreaded
gypsies
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
early
in
the
spring
and
late
in
the
summer
roving
bands
of
bohemians
encamped
on
the
banks
of
the
gardon
and
philip
and
dolores
took
good
care
not
to
approach
them
especially
after
an
evening
when
an
old
gypsy
woman
struck
dolores
out
to
some
of
the
tribe
who
went
into
ecstasies
over
her
beauty
one
of
the
gypsies
approached
the
children
to
beg
which
so
terrified
them
that
they
clung
frantically
to
coursegol
who
found
it
difficult
to
reassure
them
these
pleasant
rambles
the
lessons
which
she
recited
to
her
adopted
father
the
religious
instruction
she
received
from
the
marquise
and
long
hours
of
play
with
philip
made
up
the
life
of
dolores
day
succeeded
day
without
bringing
anything
to
break
the
pleasant
monotony
of
their
existence
for
the
capture
of
a
mischievous
fox
an
encounter
with
some
harmless
snake
or
the
periodical
overflow
of
the
gardon
could
scarcely
be
dignified
by
the
name
of
an
event
yet
these
or
similar
incidents
furnished
the
children
with
topics
of
conversation
for
weeks
together
they
took
little
interest
in
the
news
that
came
from
paris
and
though
they
sometimes
observed
a
cloud
on
the
brow
of
the
marquis
or
tears
in
the
eyes
of
his
wife
they
were
ignorant
of
the
cause
nor
was
it
possible
or
the
well
founded
fears
of
the
royalists
which
were
frequently
mentioned
in
the
letters
received
at
the
chateau
thirteen
serene
and
happy
years
passed
after
dolores
became
the
adopted
daughter
of
the
marquis
de
chamondrin
before
she
made
her
first
acquaintance
with
real
sorrow
she
had
grown
rapidly
and
her
mental
progress
had
kept
pace
with
her
physical
development
she
promised
to
be
an
honor
to
her
parents
and
to
justify
them
in
their
determination
to
keep
her
with
them
always
but
the
marquis
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
projects
formed
years
before
in
relation
to
his
son
s
future
as
we
have
previously
stated
the
marquis
even
before
the
birth
of
his
son
dreamed
of
restoring
in
him
and
through
him
the
glory
of
the
house
of
chamondrin
a
glory
which
had
suffered
an
eclipse
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
it
was
now
time
to
carry
these
plans
into
execution
philip
was
eighteen
a
vigorous
youth
already
a
man
in
stature
and
in
bearing
endowed
with
all
the
faults
and
virtues
of
and
especially
of
an
incontestable
courage
and
a
profound
reverence
for
the
name
he
bore
the
marquis
had
about
decided
that
the
time
to
send
him
to
paris
had
come
he
had
been
preparing
for
this
event
for
some
months
and
thanks
to
the
economy
in
which
he
had
been
so
admirably
seconded
by
his
wife
he
had
laid
by
a
very
considerable
amount
enough
to
supply
philip
s
wants
for
five
years
at
least
that
is
until
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
obtain
some
office
at
court
or
a
command
in
the
army
but
the
marquis
had
taken
other
measures
to
insure
his
son
s
success
he
had
appealed
to
family
friends
and
through
the
chevalier
de
florian
an
occasional
guest
at
the
chateau
he
had
received
an
assurance
that
philip
would
find
an
earnest
champion
in
the
duke
de
penthieore
fortune
seemed
inclined
to
smile
on
the
young
man
nevertheless
the
marquis
was
beset
with
doubts
for
all
this
occurred
in
the
year
just
as
the
hostility
to
the
king
was
beginning
marquis
asked
himself
again
and
again
if
this
was
a
propitious
moment
to
send
so
young
a
man
almost
a
boy
into
a
divided
and
disaffected
court
a
court
too
that
was
subjected
to
the
closest
espionage
on
the
part
of
a
people
already
deeply
incensed
and
irritated
by
the
scandal
and
debauchery
of
the
nobility
and
utterly
insensible
to
the
king
s
well
meant
efforts
to
institute
a
much
needed
reform
but
the
birth
of
the
dauphin
which
occurred
that
same
year
dissipated
m
de
chamondrin
s
doubts
he
was
completely
reassured
by
the
enthusiasm
of
a
nation
which
even
in
its
dire
extremity
broke
into
songs
of
rejoicing
over
the
new
born
heir
philip
s
departure
was
decided
upon
the
young
people
had
been
aware
of
their
father
s
intentions
for
some
time
they
knew
the
hour
of
separation
was
approaching
and
the
tears
sprang
to
their
eyes
whenever
any
allusion
to
philip
s
intended
departure
was
made
in
their
presence
but
with
the
characteristic
light
heartedness
of
youth
they
dismissed
the
unwelcome
thought
from
the
future
held
in
store
for
them
but
the
flight
of
time
is
rapid
and
that
which
causes
us
little
anxiety
because
it
was
the
future
that
is
a
possibility
becomes
the
present
in
other
words
reality
one
day
the
marquis
not
without
emotion
made
known
his
plans
to
his
wife
and
afterwards
to
his
son
philip
was
to
start
for
paris
at
the
close
of
autumn
or
in
about
two
months
and
coursegol
was
to
accompany
him
this
news
carried
despair
to
the
heart
of
dolores
for
she
loved
philip
devotedly
had
he
not
been
her
brother
her
protector
and
the
sharer
of
all
her
joys
since
she
was
old
enough
to
talk
could
it
be
she
was
about
to
lose
him
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
to
conceal
the
fact
the
grief
was
general
the
departure
of
philip
would
be
a
sore
trial
to
all
the
inmates
of
the
chateau
dolores
was
inconsolable
a
dozen
times
a
day
the
marquise
conquering
her
the
advantages
philip
would
derive
from
this
journey
but
the
poor
girl
could
understand
but
one
thing
that
her
brother
was
to
leave
her
for
an
indefinite
time
for
several
days
before
his
departure
she
scarcely
left
his
side
how
many
plans
were
made
to
be
carried
into
execution
on
his
return
how
many
bright
hopes
were
mingled
with
the
sadness
of
those
last
hours
philip
who
had
become
grave
and
serious
as
befitted
his
new
role
declared
that
