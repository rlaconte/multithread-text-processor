us
they
can
not
name
my
tides
or
measure
me
by
the
marks
drawn
on
a
wall
i
hover
but
let
me
tell
you
that
if
there
is
a
call
from
the
come
over
over
you
came
young
boy
from
the
house
to
these
woods
with
me
running
in
them
and
you
called
out
any
name
and
i
will
never
tell
it
and
the
woods
held
the
name
you
called
and
trembled
with
the
name
and
all
the
nests
shook
with
it
and
berries
swung
with
the
calling
like
little
bells
and
flowers
rocked
the
name
like
listening
faces
turning
their
ears
to
hear
the
name
and
birds
flushed
up
at
the
calling
of
the
name
and
animals
stopped
where
they
were
going
and
pricked
their
ears
and
heard
and
their
ears
held
the
name
you
called
you
walked
and
thought
of
all
those
killed
by
their
love
and
lovers
and
you
had
none
of
all
lost
causes
of
hunters
and
explorers
of
all
failures
of
men
going
after
something
and
said
the
words
that
the
mexicans
say
dios
dios
dios
and
wished
and
yearned
for
someone
to
lead
you
and
to
follow
and
you
knew
that
i
river
wide
p
spread
corruption
and
drouth
the
flaccid
land
of
the
dead
and
lain
upon
it
and
covered
it
with
my
sperm
and
brought
up
life
from
corruption
that
i
crossed
over
my
banks
and
went
where
there
was
nothing
of
me
where
i
was
not
and
left
some
of
myself
there
but
there
is
the
inevitable
return
we
are
forever
going
out
and
coming
in
joining
and
abandoning
alone
and
together
once
when
you
were
swimming
naked
it
happened
for
the
first
time
to
you
in
me
christy
stood
on
the
bank
and
told
you
and
berryben
to
jump
in
and
touch
my
bottom
and
see
who
could
come
up
to
the
top
first
and
you
were
struggling
to
come
up
first
rising
rising
rising
faster
faster
when
some
marvelous
thing
that
can
happen
to
all
of
us
happened
to
you
wound
up
and
burst
and
hurt
you
hurt
you
and
you
came
up
changed
last
to
the
top
trembling
and
exhausted
and
sat
down
on
my
banks
and
tried
to
make
you
jump
into
me
again
you
blamed
it
secretly
on
christy
that
he
had
made
you
feel
like
this
and
were
afraid
of
him
for
it
this
was
the
way
you
learned
what
could
happen
to
you
but
not
why
like
a
clock
that
could
wind
up
and
chime
in
you
down
there
by
me
in
these
woods
you
once
made
up
for
what
you
never
had
played
your
fingers
over
my
hairy
rockmossand
lay
against
my
sandstone
and
ached
and
cramped
and
burned
and
i
know
what
happened
there
just
you
hard
against
my
rock
and
in
your
trousers
all
over
you
hot
and
running
like
glue
you
washed
you
inpmy
waters
and
by
my
waters
you
lay
down
and
wept
and
slept
by
me
from
then
on
you
were
aware
of
the
feeling
water
could
make
you
have
we
were
lovers
i
had
you
rising
and
falling
in
me
and
you
left
something
in
me
and
it
was
mixed
with
my
rich
and
i
cast
your
sperm
mixed
in
my
spume
and
sediment
onto
the
land
the
country
of
your
beginnings
and
we
made
it
rich
what
i
taught
you
is
that
there
must
be
a
rising
and
a
falling
a
bursting
and
a
casting
out
all
your
family
feared
water
would
not
cross
it
on
bridges
would
not
swim
much
in
it
but
one
drowned
in
it
cross
it
love
it
be
water
you
are
river
i
am
you
and
once
in
my
greatest
flood
when
i
was
swollen
huge
and
throbbing
with
all
my
fluid
i
crept
through
charity
and
through
bailey
s
pasture
close
to
you
and
to
your
house
and
lay
by
you
and
by
the
house
we
were
joined
again
and
heard
within
it
all
the
murmurings
of
the
house
by
the
shuttered
window
in
the
cellar
in
the
loft
in
the
kitchen
by
the
map
and
sang
my
duet
with
the
girl
on
the
world
and
you
slipped
out
to
me
ship
in
the
bottle
that
i
floated
down
and
away
onto
the
waters
of
the
mapped
world
he
looked
at
and
became
and
also
dropped
some
folner
spangles
and
a
stranger
s
photograph
and
a
string
of
ruby
beads
and
i
received
them
all
and
mixed
them
in
my
substance
in
my
stuff
and
i
lay
upon
all
the
life
of
the
people
of
the
house
left
in
the
pasture
the
sawdust
the
bones
of
frozen
and
shot
roma
the
cow
the
go
to
sleeppflowers
the
bitterweeds
the
lost
doll
the
babybuggy
i
washed
over
all
the
footprints
on
the
path
of
folner
and
you
and
berryben
and
christy
and
swimma
saw
malley
peeking
at
me
through
the
shutter
and
watched
all
of
you
sitting
on
the
front
gallery
together
fearing
me
heard
the
grinding
of
the
cisternwheel
and
heard
the
splashing
of
the
dropped
bucket
in
the
well
and
when
i
left
the
pasture
you
know
what
i
left
what
you
left
in
me
and
i
brought
back
to
you
and
to
your
pasture
we
in
bottomland
and
pasture
and
i
knew
your
agony
with
christy
in
my
woods
heard
it
and
took
the
gift
of
birds
you
threw
me
christy
s
yoke
and
your
yoke
and
my
yoke
and
dissolvedthem
in
my
substance
when
i
rolled
over
onto
the
world
in
my
agony
and
thought
lost
in
charity
that
i
might
never
find
my
way
back
home
to
the
bottomlands
i
slept
by
you
and
in
my
agony
i
was
reaching
out
to
touch
the
world
and
i
touched
you
when
i
touched
the
world
i
touched
myself
that
i
had
put
in
you
reach
spread
roll
out
onto
fort
and
sitting
his
horse
looking
over
the
fields
bare
with
winter
and
ruined
by
neglect
jeremiah
suddenly
saw
them
covered
with
corn
and
oats
and
rich
pasturage
and
fat
cattle
on
the
pasture
he
felt
the
surge
of
energy
in
him
which
would
make
the
vision
real
then
he
thought
is
this
my
end
to
be
rich
and
easy
and
heavy
as
my
best
sow
glutted
on
oak
mast
for
the
moment
he
was
sick
with
self
loathing
then
he
saw
again
his
father
s
swarthy
face
wearing
the
grim
smile
he
used
to
smile
when
looking
at
a
rich
harvest
and
he
thought
again
how
he
old
beaumont
would
never
have
let
a
good
field
go
to
pieces
or
a
fat
pig
stray
and
how
old
beaumont
would
have
been
great
given
his
chance
greater
than
colonel
fort
then
jeremiah
saw
the
truth
he
saw
it
clearly
he
would
make
the
vision
of
old
beaumont
s
revenge
on
all
the
great
whose
company
he
had
not
been
able
to
join
for
old
beaumont
had
a
score
to
settle
too
just
as
rachel
jordan
had
a
score
to
settle
it
was
a
score
with
colonel
fort
one
of
the
great
to
whom
all
things
came
easy
fat
land
and
power
and
reputation
among
men
and
the
white
ardent
flesh
of
a
young
woman
in
a
dark
house
it
all
fell
into
order
for
jeremiah
beaumont
his
pleasure
in
his
wife
his
waiting
at
the
tavern
for
news
his
nocturnal
brooding
over
his
great
purpose
and
his
daylight
energy
in
the
fields
and
as
the
year
wore
on
to
harvest
his
imagination
began
to
leap
into
the
future
beyond
this
harvest
he
would
buy
some
merino
sheep
the
kind
that
colonel
fort
had
introduced
into
this
section
he
would
take
out
the
timber
on
the
creek
for
a
new
cornland
and
throw
part
of
the
old
cornland
to
pasture
to
save
it
from
wear
and
washing
and
as
one
sunday
afternoon
in
august
he
came
upon
the
place
for
a
mill
so
the
merinos
the
new
cornland
and
the
mill
entered
his
calculations
and
his
dreams
he
could
see
them
before
him
what
else
could
he
see
before
him
he
saw
rachel
s
face
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
every
day
speaking
to
him
across
the
supper
table
musing
in
the
dusk
as
they
walked
in
the
garden
smiling
up
at
him
from
a
pillow
from
the
midst
of
her
unbound
hair
as
he
reached
to
snuff
the
candle
did
he
still
see
colonel
fort
the
solid
bulk
and
sad
face
beyond
the
out
thrust
pistol
pointed
at
him
at
jeremiah
beaumont
that
body
or
his
own
lying
on
the
ground
by
some
ritual
grove
with
the
patch
of
red
growing
on
the
breast
he
says
this
much
i
could
not
forget
my
obligation
and
my
manhood
but
circumstance
taught
me
patience
he
had
to
be
patient
for
in
the
late
spring
colonel
fort
had
york
he
had
gone
as
one
of
a
committee
of
three
to
try
to
work
out
a
system
of
postponement
for
debts
owed
in
kentucky
to
banks
and
merchants
in
those
cities
wilkie
barron
had
told
jeremiah
that
for
in
june
wilkie
was
back
at
his
uncle
s
house
on
a
visit
as
a
note
brought
by
a
colored
boy
on
a
mule
informed
jeremiah
one
evening
the
next
day
jeremiah
rode
over
to
the
barron
place
he
found
wilkie
prosperous
and
full
of
affairs
he
was
practicing
law
now
in
lexington
under
the
wing
of
mr
madison
writing
articles
for
skrogg
s
advocate
speechifying
for
relief
consorting
with
the
great
whose
names
now
came
easily
to
his
tongue
he
was
a
little
heavier
than
before
but
still
lithe
in
carriage
and
quick
in
movement
ills
glistening
boots
creaked
elegantly
jeremiah
gives
us
the
word
as
he
paced
old
barron
s
veranda
and
gestured
with
his
cigar
and
expatiated
on
the
wickedness
and
defect
of
public
spirit
and
ignorance
of
law
just
exhibited
by
may
a
certain
blair
wilkie
explained
had
owed
one
williams
wilkie
dwelt
on
the
half
cent
the
year
before
in
in
the
august
term
of
the
bourbon
county
circuit
court
williams
had
received
judgment
against
blair
for
the
debt
and
costs
immediately
according
to
the
replevin
law
of
december
duly
passed
by
the
legislature
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
blair
had
gained
relief
by
a
replevin
bond
for
two
years
but
in
november
williams
had
moved
to
quash
the
replevin
bond
and
collect
on
may
judge
clark
had
given
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
creditor
williams
declaring
that
the
replevin
law
of
kentucky
was
void
he
had
cited
section
x
of
article
i
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
forbade
the
passing
of
any
ex
post
facto
law
or
any
law
breaching
the
obligation
of
contract
and
had
then
declared
that
section
xviii
of
article
x
of
the
kentucky
constitution
was
in
full
agreement
if
judge
clark
s
decision
stood
it
wilkie
declared
by
god
it
could
not
it
is
the
law
jeremiah
said
i
remember
the
article
in
the
kentucky
constitution
we
could
change
it
wilkie
declared
for
what
is
our
constitution
for
it
is
to
protect
the
people
of
the
state
and
when
it
does
not
protect
it
is
not
valid
we
will
change
it
jeremiah
pointed
out
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
remain
p
remain
wilkie
exclaimed
it
will
remain
where
it
belongs
on
a
scrap
of
sheep
s
hide
in
washington
but
not
here
for
this
commonwealth
has
its
dignity
and
shall
make
its
own
law
and
its
people
shall
not
starve
he
teetered
on
the
edge
of
the
veranda
and
gestured
with
his
cigar
he
seemed
not
to
be
speaking
so
much
to
jeremiah
as
to
the
empty
space
of
the
yard
which
might
be
full
of
people
people
waitingand
listening
to
wilkie
barron
then
he
swung
to
jeremiah
have
seen
beggary
on
the
streets
of
lexington
i
have
seen
see
he
gets
some
decent
clothes
and
then
he
anything

up
in
the
old
chest

gave
him
well
let
s
give
him
a
chance
before

on
him
most
likely

ll
do
the
right
thing
if
he
wo
nt
we
ll
have
to
rig
up
ways
to
get
around
him
for
instance
if
he
wo
nt
come
up
to
eat
at
my
place
i
ll
have
to
send
him
something
down
to
his
shanty
supper

suit
me
best
that
s
when
we
have
our
heavy
meal
now
on
account
of
portius
not
getting
home
much
at
noon
then
i
ll
have
one
of
the
children

but
i
do
nt
want
you
complaining
it
looks
like
you
do
nt
have
enough
to
feed
him
that
s
the
way
it
was
settled
sayward
herself
went
down
to
see
him
whenever
she
could
it
hurt
something
deep
inside
of
her
to
come
from
her
fine
big
house
and
see
her
father
low
she
had
to
duck
her
head
coming
in
his
bed
a
bunk
against
one
side
no
more
than
two
could
sit
in
here
at
one
time
unless
they
sat
on
the
bunk
why
wo
nt
you
stay
with
us
in
the
house
pap
she
d
asked
him
but
he
never
would
one
time
he
told
her
right
where
your
place
stands
i
shot
the
deer
with
the
blue
horn
do
you
mind
that
ole
blue
horn
it
had
a
mess
of
points
oh
that
was
a
handsomespot
them
days
i
kin
see
it
yit
with
the
big
butts
and
creepers
the
way
god
almighty
made
it
why
it
was
sop
thick
around
ar
that
buck
never
seed
me
and
now
all
slashed
off
and
gone
to
rack
and
ruin
i
kai
nt
look
at
it
only
thing
left
is
the
river
and
that
do
nt
look
like
itself
with
the
woods
killed
off
and
not
near
the
water
coming
down
that
used
to
carry
the
supper
basket
he
and
massey
hated
still
worse
when
their
school
mates
asked
is
your
grandfather
still
living
down
at
the
boat
yard
but
the
older
girls
said
thank
god
the
old
man
is
nt
in
the
house
now
that
aunt
cornelia
is
coming
seldom
if
ever
was
it
grandfather
or
grandpap
no
it
was
the
octogenarian
or
the
ancestor
or
the
old
man
of
the
western
waters
or
mama
s
old
indianfighter
and
painter
tracker
portius
was
the
one
who
put
them
up
to
it
especially
now
that
his
fine
blue
stockingsister
was
coming
from
the
bay
state
to
visit
them
in
ohio
the
first
time
sayward
laid
eyes
on
her
she
had
to
admit
to
wonder
how
she
and
her
would
get
along
portius
had
looked
for
his
sister
by
boat
that
way
she
could
nt
have
got
to
americus
before
june
but
one
day
late
in
may
sayward
and
dezia
were
house
cleaning
when
they
saw
the
driver
go
out
of
his
way
but
this
time
he
drew
up
right
in
front
of
their
house
and
sayward
knew
it
must
be
for
a
good
reason
even
before
ned
hanshaw
got
down
from
his
seat
and
set
a
pile
of
traps
on
the
sidewalk
then
he
opened
the
coach
door
and
a
lady
stepped
down
could
that
be
portius
s
sister
sayward
thought
she
had
always
reckoned
cornelia
wheeler
like
mrs
morrison
tall
and
sweeping
with
a
handsome
face
and
gracious
manner
now
this
was
a
short
plain
woman
more
like
aunt
unity
and
with
a
face
like
the
pope
s
her
bonnet
looked
plainp
and
old
style
enough
her
hair
drawn
down
severely
on
either
side
yet
the
stern
way
she
held
herself
the
costly
look
of
her
ribbed
taffeta
and
the
respectful
way
ned
hanshaw
treated
her
told
you
that
this
was
a
great
lady
and
one
more
to
reckon
with
than
mrs
morrison
dezia
fled
upstairs
to
change
her
dress
but
sayward
went
right
out
as
she
was
in
her
red
waiting
in
the
street
with
her
traps
and
everybody
in
the
stage
and
square
a
watching
i
m
saird
i
reckon
you
re
cornelia
she
said
and
gave
the
white
fingers
in
the
black
mit
a
stout
shake
you
are
portius
s
wife
his
sister
s
eyes
went
over
her
distant
as
bay
state
mountain
but
sayward
would
nt
explain
that
they
had
nt
looked
for
her
yet
and
that
s
why
she
was
nt
better
dressed
come
right
in
i
ll
fetch
your
traps
she
said
portius
will
be
real
surprised
when
he
comes
home
and
finds
you
re
here
she
spoke
friendly
like
sisters
in
law
should
but
already
she
felt
that
cornelia
wheeler
looked
down
on
her
sayward
thought
she
would
nt
mind
too
much
the
only
thing
portius
s
sister
better
not
look
down
on
was
her
children
for
they
had
wheeler
blood
a
flowing
in
their
veins
the
same
as
their
aunt
cornelia
not
so
much
perhaps
but
enough
to
let
them
stand
up
she
need
nt
have
fretted
when
dezia
came
down
all
dressed
up
her
aunt
cornelia
gave
her
plenty
of
notice
so
this
is
dezia
of
whom
i
ve
heard
so
much
she
said
in
her
genteel
bay
state
voice
and
held
her
cheek
to
be
kissed
which
she
had
nt
to
sayward
her
keen
blue
yankee
eyes
surveyed
the
girl
did
your
father
ever
tell
you
that
you
look
like
your
grandmother
wheeler
child
in
everything
i
may
say
but
your
hair
your
grandmother
wheeler
used
to
brush
her
hair
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
every
morning
and
evening
she
was
a
very
resourceful
and
determined
woman
she
was
determined
to
have
beautiful
hair
and
she
did
that
sayward
found
later
was
her
sister
in
law
to
a
t
she
turned
her
sharp
yankee
eyes
on
every
young
wheeler
that
came
around
reminded
them
who
they
were
and
started
to
wait
for
the
election
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
that
they
might
do
anything
to
influence
it
jackson
s
name
was
on
the
ballot
and
he
might
do
very
well
or
might
not
at
any
rate
they
had
felt
close
to
this
matter
before
and
now
felt
very
distant
from
it
inwardly
the
effect
of
the
flight
death
breaking
think
of
it
as
they
might
of
tom
kettle
counterpointed
the
social
catastrophe
painfully
and
yet
not
hopelessly
the
night
cameron
had
come
home
from
barkley
s
office
and
sat
late
in
the
kitchen
with
margaret
the
fact
of
kettle
s
arrest
like
a
single
strain
of
bacteria
that
would
work
variously
in
various
media
had
worked
inwardly
in
them
producing
a
kind
of
fever
that
seemed
to
burn
clean
enough
to
heal
something
in
themselves
just
as
in
barkley
s
office
and
who
knew
where
else
the
same
inoculation
had
worked
creating
many
relationstotal
in
themselves
and
yet
linked
to
the
other
relations
which
out
of
some
invisible
corruption
in
the
world
s
shape
which
kettle
if
he
did
nothing
else
opened
with
all
its
stink
that
night
they
had
talked
of
the
logic
of
the
situation
until
all
at
once
in
their
uncertainty
they
began
talking
of
the
possibility
that
kettle
might
kill
himself
margaret
sat
there
then
with
her
eyes
perfectly
blank
her
lips
loosened
with
the
strain
of
emotion
and
she
had
said
i
do
nt
think
tom
will
he
would
have
already
if
he
had
been
going
to
would
have
before
now
that
s
a
funny
female
statement
i
know
it
does
nt
make
much
sense
does
it
that
s
what
i
believe
too
easy
too
damn
easy
we
talk
about
his
having
somewhere
to
go
and
i
keep
remembering
the
way
he
said
pleasure
pleasure
that
hurt
i
ve
never
heard
anybody
say
anything
that
way
before
that
s
about
all
he
d
have
left
if
he
pulled
out
of
him
put
her
face
in
her
hands
in
a
short
coquettish
gesture
and
when
she
raised
her
head
again
her
eyes
were
glittering
with
something
that
was
not
sorrow
nor
happiness
either
she
had
blushed
so
the
tips
of
her
fingers
left
white
spots
on
her
cheeks
where
they
had
pressed
andy
this
is
funny
shall
i
say
it
to
you
or
not
say
you
re
not
going
to
laugh
at
me
and
now
oddly
she
began
to
look
pale
and
frightened
do
nt
laugh
at
me
andy
this
is
what
i
ve
figured
out
from
thinking
about
it
all
evening
here
i
sat
all
evening
thinking
while
you
were
gone
talking
to
barkley
men
can
go
do
things
while
women
ca
nt
that
makes
a
lot
of
difference
but
there
s
well
i
could
nt
help
thinking
that
i
understood
tom
kettle
better
when
i
found
out
for
sure
he
was
a
homosexual
because
i
m
a
woman
i
mean
like
a
child
that
wants
approval
but
it
s
the
kind
of
trouble
in
some
ways
like
the
trouble
a
woman
gets
into
you
would
nt
know
anything
about
that
do
nt
you
think
maybe
i
do
know
better
p
he
shook
his
head
that
s
imagination
barkley
told
me
a
lot
of
things
tonight
about
kettle
s
past
that
i
m
trying
to
fit
in
all
these
years
with
the
progressive
movements
that
have
been
going
to
pieces
under
him
it
s
got
something
to
do
with
that
some
kind
of
hell
with
it
all
gesture
no
she
said
she
came
to
him
and
put
her
arms
around
his
head
pulling
his
face
against
the
wide
yielding
marsh
soft
curve
of
her
belly
she
drew
back
to
look
at
him
i
love
you
so
andy
my
good
andy
then
she
pulled
him
to
her
again
my
dear
dear
andy
come
in
the
bedroom
andy
i
want
to
tell
you
this
light
they
lay
on
the
bed
with
their
flanks
touching
and
holding
each
other
s
hands
margaret
s
hand
was
damp
in
the
palm
andy
do
you
know
what
it
feels
like
to
be
really
lonely
yes
he
said
but
the
single
and
empty
word
was
not
enough
for
her
no
you
do
nt
know
what
i
mean
i
think
women
know
better
and
about
tom
the
white
curtains
around
the
windows
made
a
frame
a
little
paler
than
the
walls
or
the
night
and
he
watched
this
pale
frame
while
she
gathered
her
thoughts
and
went
on
you
know
they
say
homosexuals
have
female
genes
or
something
like
that
so
they
re
part
women
and
you
re
not
one
so
you
do
nt
understand
i
ll
have
to
tell
you
do
you
believe
me
everybody
has
been
lonely
honey
if
you
mean
that
homosexuals
must
be
lonelier
than
other
people
i
ll
agree
i
do
nt
mean
because
of
social
pressures
and
so
on
before
p
as
he
lay
there
watching
the
curtains
he
heard
her
swallow
hard
andy
did
you
have
any
girls
while
you
were
in
the
army
he
felt
his
pulse
begin
pounding
but
it
was
not
with
any
fear
for
himself
he
knew
from
this
beginning
what
would
come
his
mouth
felt
dry
he
knew
that
she
was
crying
once
he
said
in
texas
it
was
nt
anything
that
kind
of
thing
does
nt
matter
does
nt
matter
you
fool
you
fool
you
think
because
it
s
a
war
you
get
a
dispensation
like
the
jews
and
catholics
to
eat
meat
anytime
and
there
s
some
kind
of
dispensation
that
says
it
does
nt
matter
she
made
a
fist
of
the
hand
he
had
been
holding
and
struck
gently
again
and
again
at
his
leg
oh
you
big
fool
no
wonder
you
ca
nt
understand
tom
kettle
may
not
for
you
because
you
re
a
man
and
it
really
does
nt
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
something
that
happened
to
me
yes
he
said
i
knew
that
he
felt
the
spittle
in
his
mouth
becoming
without
being
too
brutal
an
easy
assignment
the
colonel
said
i
ll
skip
the
times
the
weather
is
cloudy
and
the
place
smoking
the
enemy
with
artillery
and
mortar
s
advises
that
s
wants
red
to
button
up
by
s
wants
you
to
button
up
and
use
plenty
of
artillery
white
reports
that
they
are
in
fair
shape
s
informs
that
a
company
will
swing
around
and
tie
in
with
b
b
company

stopped
first
by
enemy
action
and
stayed
there
of
their
own
accord
s
is
nt
doing
so
good
this
is
unofficial
he
wants
more
artillery
but
there
is
nt
any
more
artillery
you
wanted
combat
for
what
i
do
nt
know
really
why
or
really
know
why
who
wants
true
combat
but
here
it
is
daughter
on
the
telephone
and
later
i
will
put
in
the
sounds
and
smells
and
anecdotes
about
who
was
killed
when
and
where
if
you
want
them
i
only
want
what
you
will
tell
me
i
ll
tell
you
how
it
was
the
colonel
said
and
general
walter
bedell
smith
does
nt
know
how
it
was
yet
i
have
been
so
many
times
i
m
glad
we
do
nt
have
to
know
him
or
the
nylon
smooth
man
the
girl
said
we
wo
nt
have
to
know
them
this
side
of
hell
the
colonel
assured
her
and
i
will
have
a
detail
guarding
the
gates
of
hell
so
that
no
such
characters
enter
you
sound
like
dante
she
said
sleepily
i
am
mister
dante
he
said
for
the
moment
and
for
a
while
he
was
and
he
drew
all
the
circles
they
were
as
unjust
as
dante
s
but
he
drew
them
i
will
skip
the
detailed
part
since
you
are
justifiably
and
should
be
sleepy
the
colonel
said
he
watched
again
the
strange
play
of
the
light
on
the
ceiling
then
he
looked
at
the
girl
who
was
more
beautiful
than
any
girl
that
he
had
ever
seen
ever
he
had
seen
them
come
and
go
and
they
go
faster
flies
they
can
go
faster
from
fair
beauty
to
the
knocker
s
shop
than
any
other
animal
he
thought
but
i
believe
that
this
one
could
hold
the
pace
and
stay
the
course
the
dark
ones
last
the
best
he
thought
and
look
at
the
bony
structure
in
that
face
this
one
has
a
fine
blood
line
too
and
she
can
go
forever
most
of
our
own
lovely
beauties
come
from
soda
counters
and
they
do
not
know
their
grandfather
s
last
name
unless
maybe
it
was
schultz
or
schlitz
he
thought
this
is
the
wrong
attitude
to
take
he
said
to
himself
since
he
did
not
wish
to
express
any
of
these
sentiments
to
the
girl
who
would
not
like
them
anyway
and
was
soundly
sleepy
now
the
way
a
cat
is
when
it
sleeps
within
itself
sleep
well
my
dearest
lovely
and
i
will
just
tell
it
for
nothing
the
girl
was
asleep
still
holding
his
bad
hand
that
he
despised
breathe
when
they
are
easily
asleep
the
colonel
told
her
all
about
it
but
he
did
not
utter
it
so
after
i
had
the
privilege
of
hearing
general
walter
bedell
smith
explain
the
facility
of
the
attack
we
made
it
there
was
the
big
red
one
who
believed
their
own
publicity
there
was
the
ninth
which
was
a
better
division
than
we
were
there
was
us
who
had
always
done
it
when
they
asked
for
you
to
do
it
we
had
no
time
to
read
comic
books
and
we
had
no
time
for
practically
nothing
because
we
always
moved
before
first
light
this
is
difficult
and
you
have
to
throw
away
the
big
picture
and
be
a
division
we
wore
a
four
leaf
clover
which
meant
nothing
except
among
ourselves
who
all
loved
it
and
every
time
i
ever
see
it
the
same
thing
happens
in
my
inner
guts
some
people
thought
that
it
was
ivy
but
it
was
not
it
was
a
four
leaf
clover
disguised
as
ivy
the
orders
the
first
infantry
division
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
and
they
and
their
calypso
singing
pro
never
let
you
forget
it
he
was
a
nice
guy
and
it
was
his
job
but
you
get
fed
up
with
horse
shit
unless
you
like
the
aroma
or
the
taste
i
never
liked
it
although
i
loved
to
walk
through
cow
shit
when
i
was
a
kid
and
feel
it
between
my
toes
but
horse
shit
bores
you
it
bores
me
very
rapidly
and
i
can
detect
it
at
over
one
thousand
yards
so
we
attacked
the
three
of
us
in
line
exactly
where
the
germans
wished
us
to
attack
we
will
not
mention
general
walter
bedell
smith
any
further
he
is
not
the
villain
he
only
made
the
promises
and
explained
how
it
would
go
there
are
no
villains
i
presume
in
a
democracy
he
was
only
just
as
wrong
as
hell
period
he
added
in
his
mind
the
patches
had
all
been
removed
even
as
far
back
as
the
rear
echelon
the
three
he
knew
so
well
who
were
going
to
attack
we
were
going
to
attack
with
the
three
of
us
in
line
and
nothing
in
reserve
i
wo
nt
try
to
explain
what
that
means
daughter
but
it
is
nt
any
good
and
the
place
we
were
going
to
fight
in
which
i
had
taken
a
good
look
at
was
going
to
be
passchendaele
with
tree
bursts
i
say
that
too
much
but
i
think
it
too
much
the
poor
bloody
twenty
eighth
which
was
up
on
our
right
had
been
bogged
down
for
some
time
and
so
there
was
pretty
accurate
information
available
about
what
conditions
in
those
woods
were
going
to
be
like
i
think
we
could
conservatively
describe
them
as
unfavorable
then
we
were
ordered
to
commit
one
regiment
before
the
attack
started
that
means
that
the
enemy
will
get
at
least
one
prisoner
which
makes
all
the
taking
off
well
almost
the
best
his
name
was
undoubtedly
jerome
wildberg
he
really
had
wanted
a
boy
to
take
over
the
business
but
had
thought
it
would
be
cute
to
name
her
jere
whatsa
matta
you
did
nt
take
me
for
a
shicksa
didja
she
was
laughing
at
him
it
was
waltz
time
now
and
the
musicians
who
seemed
to
know
all
the
new
ones
started
up
with
will
you
remember
jewish
or
not
manley
conceded
she
was
something
to
look
at
and
there
was
a
quickness
in
her
an
imaginativeness
a
streak
of
non
conformity
a
high
keyed
vitality
new
to
him
wait
till
he
told
the
jewish
welfare
board
dance
in
the
arms
of
an
indescribably
beautiful
jewess
he
was
just
about
to
draw
her
a
little
closer
to
him
for
the
waltz
when
a
short
swarthy
corporal
muttered
sorry
lieutenant
and
took
her
away
for
an
hour
he
was
alternately
ecstatic
and
glum
as
he
cut
in
yielded
cut
in
again
in
the
minutes
when
he
was
forced
to
the
sidelines
he
was
startled
to
find
how
desperate
he
became
he
had
to
touch
her
again
feel
her
lithe
young
body
moving
with
his
and
marvel
at
the
way
her
mind
whipped
unexpected
words
to
her
impudent
tongue
lieutenant
you
must
nt
monopolize
me
you
sound
like
a
bull
mooser
you
see
it
s
part
of
our
job
to
remain
in
circulation
i
refuse
to
have
you
sound
like
a
lending
library
book
and
anyway
you
re
much
too
handsome
why
miss
wildberg
it
s
true
you
are
nt
by
any
chance
just
call
me
george
gordon
when
we
re
alone
i
always
have
to
be
on
my
guard
against
handsome
men
men
as
good
looking
as
francis
x
bushman
but
with
something
delicateand
ethereal
about
them
something
poetic
have
you
fallen
in
love
with
many
like
that
oh
hundreds
i
hate
them
all
so
do
i
now
i
fall
out
of
love
even
quicker
than
i
fall
in
that
s
why
i
know
i
should
never
be
married
but
did
nt
you
tell
me
you
were
married
oh
did
i
a
thin
faced
private
was
in
the
way
cutting
in
lieutenant
manley
retired
to
the
sidelines
in
frustration
it
was
like
trying
to
hold
a
piece
of
quicksilver
glittering
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
but
slipping
away
each
time
he
tried
to
enclose
it
before

remember
that
they
took
a
good
look
at
each

it
was
a
look
of
both
tenderness
and
appraisal
what
is
your
name
lord
byron
he
thought
quickly
mannie
he
answered
mannie
hallen
stein
she
stopped
to
execute
a
little
curtsy
playfully
but
very
prettily
welcome
to
our
humble
chambers
m

he
thought
her
adorable
exquisite
her
bright
eyes
her
quick
ways
an
intruder
attempting
to
cut
in
was
rejected

come
back
later
fella
mannie
morale
not
for
my
morale
now
what
s
all
this
nonsense
about
a
husband
her
laugh
was
a
little
cry
of
triumph
he
did
nt
see
anything
to
laugh
about
had
there
ever
been
a
husband
and
did
he
write
that
stuff
she
had
been
spouting
before
well
in
a
way
in
what
way
she
had
quoted
from
something
she
was
working
on
and
could
nt
a
girl
be
married
to
her
work
what
kind
of
work
translating
rimbaud
she
was
going
to
do
an
english
translation
of
une
saison
en
enter
it
was
such
a
magnificent
poem
no
not
magnificent
terrible
she
d
say
it
over
to
herself
at
night
and
feel
almost
too
frightened
to
be
alone
it
was
that
kind
of
a
poem
it
was
nt
just
the
words
the
meaning
but
the
sound
the
feeling
but
the
job
of
translation
drove
her
to
the
limits
of
madness
it
was
so
perfect
in
french
so
passionate
so
direct
such
a
letdown
dingy
and
blah
she
said
what
made
you
want
to
do
it
why
do
people
try
to
climb
mt
everest
the
intruder
was
back
and
this
time
he
would
not
be
denied
manley
sulked
as
she
was
led
away
once
as
he
waited
on
the
sidelines
she
caught
his
eye
over
her
partner
s
shoulder
and
stuck
out
her
tongue
again
when
his
turn
came
he
held
her
closer
the
connection
was
made
and
the
currents
of
youth
poured
through
them
shyly
his
lips
pressed
through
her
hair
and
began
to
explore
the
soft
warm
lobe
of
her
ear
he
could
feel
the
involuntary
fluttering
in
her
the
quickening
into
the
darkness
of
her
ruffled
hair
he
whispereda
mysterious
incantation
jere
jere
mannie
she
spoke
softly
yes
yes
he
waited
for
the
whispered
words
aid
he
came
safely
to
ground
he
put
on
his
armor
and
strode
to
the
airlock
then
changed
his
mind
and
went
to
but
in
view
of
the
rugged
and
deserted
field
and
the
completely
unknown
terrain
between
the
field
and
the
town
he
decided
to
ride
the
creep
instead
this
vehicle
while
slow
could
go
literally
anywhere
it
had
a
cigar
shaped
body
of
magnalloy
it
had
big
soft
tough
tires
it
had
cleated
tracks
it
had
air
and
waterpropellers
it
had
folding
wings
it
had
driving
braking
and
steering
jets
it
could
traverse
the
deserts
of
mars
the
oceans
and
swamps
of
venus
the
crevassed
glaciers
of
earth
the
jagged
frigid
surface
of
an
iron
asteroid
and
the
cratered
fluffy
topography
of
the
moon
if
not
with
equal
speed
at
least
with
equal
safety
samms
released
the
thing
and
drove
it
into
the
cargo
lock
noting
mentally
that
he
would
have
to
exhaust
the
air
of
that
lock
into
space
before
he
again
broke
the
inner
seal
the
ramp
slid
back
into
the
ship
the
cargo
port
closed
here
he
was
he
did
not
know
the
palainians
reaction
to
or
attitude
toward
light
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
while
at
pluto
to
ask
and
it
might
be
important
the
landing
lights
of
his
vessel
might
already
have
done
his
cause
irreparable
harm
he
could
drive
by
starlight
if
he
had
to
but
he
needed
light
and
he
had
not
seen
a
single
living
or
moving
thing
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
a
palainian
within
miles
while
he
had
known
with
his
brain
that
palain
would
be
dark
he
had
expected
to
find
buildings
and
traffic
ground
cars
planes
and
at
least
a
few
space
ships
and
not
this
vast
nothingness
if
nothing
else
there
must
be
a
road
from
palain
s
principal
city
to
its
only
spaceport
but
samms
had
not
seen
it
from
his
vessel
and
he
could
not
see
it
now
at
least
he
could
not
recognize
it
wherefore
he
clutched
in
the
tractor
drive
and
took
off
in
a
straight
line
toward
town
the
going
but
the
creep
was
built
to
stand
up
under
punishment
and
its
pilot
s
chair
was
sprung
and
cushioned
to
exactly
the
same
degree
hence
while
the
course
itself
was
infinitely
worse
than
the
smoothly
paved
approaches
to
rigelston
samms
found
this
trip
much
less
bruising
than
the
other
had
been
approaching
the
village
he
dimmed
his
roadlights
and
slowed
down
at
its
edge
he
cut
them
entirely
and
inched
his
way
forward
by
starlight
alone
what
a
town
virgil
samms
had
seen
the
inhabited
places
of
almost
every
planet
of
civilization
he
had
seen
cities
laid
out
in
circles
sectors
ellipses
triangles
squares
parallelopipeds
practically
every
plan
known
to
geometry
he
had
seen
structures
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
narrow
skyscrapers
vast
spreading
one
stories
polyhedra
domes
spheres
semi
cylinders
and
erect
and
inverted
full
and
truncated
cones
and
pyramids
whatever
the
plan
or
the
shapes
of
the
component
units
however
those
inhabited
places
had
without
exception
been
understandable
but
this
samms
but
the
more
he
saw
the
less
he
grasped
there
was
no
plan
no
coherence
or
unity
whatever
it
was
as
though
a
cosmic
hand
had
flung
a
few
hundreds
of
buildings
of
incredibly
and
senselessly
varied
shapes
and
sizes
and
architectures
upon
an
otherwise
empty
plain
and
as
though
each
structure
had
been
allowed
ever
since
to
remain
in
whatever
location
and
attitude
it
had
chanced
to
fall
here
and
there
were
jumbled
piles
of
three
or
more
utterly
incongruous
structures
there
were
a
few
whose
arrangement
was
almost
orderly
here
and
there
were
large
irregularly
shaped
areas
of
bare
untouched
ground
there
were
no
streets
at
least
nothing
that
the
man
could
recognize
as
such
samms
headed
the
creep
for
one
of
those
open
areas
palainians
on
pluto
then
stopped
declutched
the
tracks
set
the
brakes
and
killed
the
engines
go
slow
fellow
he
advised
himself
then
until
you
find
out
what
a
dexitroboper
actually
does
while
working
at
his
trade
do
nt
take
chances
of
then
that
frigid
blooded
poison
breathers
were
not
strictly
three
dimensional
but
samms
did
know
that
he
had
actually
seen
things
which
he
could
not
understand
he
and
kinnison
had
discussed
such
occurrences
calmly
enough
but
the
actuality
was
enough
to
shake
even
the
mind
of
civilization
s
first
lensman
he
did
not
need
to
be
any
closer
anyway
he
had
learned
the
palainians
patterns
well
enough
to
lens
them
from
a
vastly
greater
distance
than
his
present
one
this
personal
visit
to
palainopolis
had
been
a
gesture
of
friendliness
not
a
necessity

moment
hewill
join
us
presently
damnation
there
it
was
again
first
dexitroboping
please
samms
requested
i
fail
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
your
thought
so
i
perceive
the
fault
is
of
course
mine
in
not
being
able
to
attune
my
mind
fully
to
yours
do
not
take
this
please
as
any
aspersion
upon
the
character
or
strength
of
your
own
mind
of
course
not
i
am
the
first
tellurian
you
have
met
yes
i
have
exchanged
thoughts
with
one
other
palainian
and
the
same
difficulty
existed
i
can
neither
understand
nor
first
lensman
palainians
on
pluto
explain
it
but
it
is
as
though
there
are
differences
between
us
so
fundamental
that
in
some
matters
mutual
comprehensionis
in
fact
impossible
a
masterly
summation
and
undoubtedly
a
true
one
this
emmfozing
then
if
i
read
correctly
your
race
has
only
two
sexes
you
read
correctly
i
can
not
understand
there
is
no
close
analogy
however
emmfozing
has
to
do
with
reproduction
i
see
his
experience
but
also
a
s
high
soprano
tones
straining
his
ears
through
the
splashing
of
the
oars
that
bore
him
toward
biloxi
ross
could
just
make
out
some
of
the
words
before
i
ll
be
a
slave
the
negroes
sang
i
ll
be
buried
in
my
grave
and
go
home
to
my
lord
and
be
free
amen
ross
whispered
watching
the
smoke
come
up
from
the
masts
and
cording
amen
and
the
augusta
stood
out
to
sea
he
got
back
to
natchez
on
the
afternoon
of
october
th
the
very
worst
day
he
could
have
chosen
to
come
home
david
and
jennie
and
cathy
were
at
the
landing
waiting
for
him
in
a
landau
with
a
pile
of
lap
robes
on
the
floor
between
the
seats
quick
cathy
said
urgently
lie
down
on
the
floor
get
under
the
robes
ross
stared
at
her
why
he
said
what
s
all
this
foolishness
about
cathy
do
as
i
say
she
snapped
they
ll
kill
you
who
ll
kill
me
ross
asked
patiently
whom
do
you
want
to
hide
me
from
the
people
jennie
said
ross
today
that
old
fool
john
brown
raided
harpers
ferry
in
virginia
in
order
to
start
a
nationwide
slave
uprising
the
people
are
pretty
excited
and
that
man
niven
came
back
yesterday
and
found
the
quarters
empty
and
you
gone
oh
ross
they
might
kill
you
they
really
might
i
see
ross
said
then
dave
take
the
girls
home
look
ross
david
began
do
as
i
say
ross
thundered
i
do
nt
sneak
into
town
untie
a
blanket
not
even
to
save
my
life
i
knew
he
d
say
that
cathy
wept
oh
you
big
stupid
jackass
i
do
nt
want
you
killed
and
i
thought
so
too
david
said
that
s
why
had
a
nigger
i
borrowed
from
finiterre
follow
us
on
nancy
llc
s
waiting
over
there
you
got
a
gun
ross
yes
ross
said
i

a
gun
then
you
better
ride
like
hell
david
said
thanks
dave
sobbed
you
damned
stupid
fool
have
nt
you
brought
me
sorrow
enough
already
reckon
i
have
ross
smiled
maybe
now
you
ll
be
rid
ofine
but
i
do
nt
want
to
be
rid
of
you
darling
cathy
wept
i
do
nt
wan
but
ross
stopped
her
protests
with
his
mouth
then
he
was
off
running
toward
where
the
black
waited
with
nancy
he
mounted
and
started
up
silver
street
but
to
their
astonishment
he
rode
very
slowly
oh
my
god
cathy
said
he
s
too
damned
stubborn
to
even
run
david
martin
pulled
at
the
reins
and
they
started
off
after
him
maybe
he
s
right
cathy
he
said
to
come
pounding
through
main
at
a
gallop
might
attract
too
much
attention
ross
had
thought
of
that
so
he
rode
slowly
quietly
through
the
crowds
nobody
noticed
him
until
he
was
almost
great
bulk
and
thundered
there
s
one
of
the
same
kind
there
s
that
damned
niggerloving
fary
right
now
the
men
started
forward
at
a
rush
and
ross
pulled
his
revolver
out
and
sat
on
nancy
waiting
i
m
not
running
men
he
said
quietly
i
do
nt
want
to
kill
any
of
you
but
by
heaven
i
will
if
i
have
to
they
hesitated
tony
niven
danced
up
and
down
with
fury
do
nt
let
him
buffalo
you
men
he
bellowed
he
ca
nt
kill
us
all
instead
of
answering
ross
brought
the
revolver
up
and
sent
a
shot
crashing
into
the
earth
exactly
between
niven
s
widespread
feet
the
bullet
plowed
up
the
earth
splattering
it
over
his
boots
no
ross
said
pleasantly
reining
nancy
to
one
side
as
he
spoke
until
she
moved
in
upon
niven
but
i
can
kill
you
niven
and
it
would
be
to
move
aside
and
let
me
through
or
you
ll
get
it
right
where
it
ll
do
you
the
most
good
i
can
scarcely
miss
from
here
anthony
niven
stared
at
him
his
beet
red
face
paling
you
win
this
time
he
said
but
i
demand
satisfaction
you
ll
meet
me
at
vidalia
tomorrow
gladly
ross
smiled
i
have
the
choice
of
weapons
of
course
niven
hesitated
supposed
the
damned
fool
chooses
rapiers
he
thought
anthony
niven
was
notorious
for
his
clumsiness
what
s
the
matter
tony
some
one
in
the
crowd
called
scairt
you
have
your
choice
he
said
huskily
ross
smiled
at
him
bowie
knives
he
said
gently
over
a
handkerchief
at
three
paces
our
left
arms
to
be
bound
together
good
day
gentlemen
tony
niven
stood
there
sweating
he
could
see
those
flashing
blades
now
feel
pary
damn
him
he
thought
is
thin
as
a
sidewinder
and
just
as
quick
hell
he
d
slash
me
to
ribbons
while
i
was
getting
set
so
thinking
he
jerked
his
revolver
out
and
sent
a
bullet
whining
a
scant
half
inch
above
ross
s
head
then
ross
turned
in
the
saddle
and
shot
him
the
ball
caught
niven
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
right
arm
breaking
the
bone
but
out
of
pure
terror
he
spun
and
fell
so
convincingly
that
all
the
others
thought
him
dead
they
started
shooting
at
ross
he
flattened
himself
out
along
nancy
s
neck
and
rode
like
hell
while
the
men
in
the
street
scattered
bolting
toward
their
horses
and
a
moment
later
they
were
pounding
through
main
street
after
him
slashing
their
horses
flanks
with
whip
and
spur
leaning
forward
standing
in
the
stirrups
ross
came
out
of
the
town
on
the
road
that
led
toward
moonrise
and
finiterre
but
that
was
a
bad
thing
ior
it
and
those
who
lived
in
it
those
men
riding
hell
for
leather
behind
him
meant
business
they
were
not
wasting
their
ammunition
by
trying
the
difficult
feat
of
trying
to
shoot
him
from
the
saddle
at
a
gallop
no
they
meant
to
corner
him
like
a
rat
and
deal
with
him
at
their
leisure
he
d
have
to
turn
off
the
road
make
a
break
for
it
through
the
brush
lose
himself
among
the
trees
here

grand
duke

little
one

strings
of
suburban
street
lights
trolleycars
frill
of
jiggling
straphangers

past

taxi
windows
it
was
fun
being
out
with
this
new
grownup
authoritative
georgie
george
elbert
do
you
remember
the
time
you
were
castingfor
pickerel
and
tipped
over
redwing
my
canoe
and
were
so
mad
at
me
for
being
a
girl
lulie
do
you
remember
the
time
georgie
do
you
remember
into
the
snow
of
the
driveway
at
fifty
two
hen
lulie
s
heart
sank
down
into
her
stomach
when
she
saw
beyond
the
dark
cars
parked
in
the
drive
the
light
trickling
out
over
the
iced
barberry
bushes
and
shadows
moving
across
the
shades
drawn
down
on
the
livingroom
windows
uncle
purdy
and
his
guests
standing
around
waiting
for
her
to
entertain
them
from
aunt
lyde
s
room
upstairs
a
low
glow
oozed
through
the
venetian
blinds
immediately
ladle
could
see
in
her
head
aunt
lyde
s
pompadour
catching
the
light
and
mrs
ritchie
s
dumpy
figure
in
her
white
dress
reading
the
inside
of
the
cup
in
a
monotonous
voice
a
tall
shadow
moved
across
the
unshaded
light
in
the
apartment
over
the
garage
zeke
was
home
her
voice
was
so
weak
it
sounded
like
a
furtive
little
whisper
in
her
own
ears
when
georgie
turned
towards
her
after
paying
the
taxidriver
let
s
go
see
zeke
first
her
hands
cold
with
dread
lulie
ran
up
the
steep
stairs
with
georgie
pounding
at
her
heels
on
the
and
stumbled
through
the
door
into
the
wide
bare
brightly
lit
room
zeke
look
what
i
found
zeke
glanced
up
questioningly
at
her
from
under
his
green
eyeshade
he
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
leaning
over
i
had
a
strange
thought
i
was
glad
that
mother
would
nt
barbara
laughed
you
underestimate
mother
she
knew
what
war
was
one
after
another
anne
said
what
should
we
do
if
dick
does
nt
get
back
barbara
said
he
will
it
would
be
unfair
if
this
family
lost
anyone
else
as
in
a
hundred
similar
homes
anne
said
i
ll
have
the
baby
right
here
if
you
ll
let
me
barbara
laughed
again
let
you
whose
home
do
you
think
it
is
anne
laughed
and
said
you
do
all
the
dishes
then
followed
a
curious
barbarism
of
war
in
anxious
america
the
names
of
the
dead
marines
on
tarawa
were
rushed
onto
the
front
pages
of
village
newspapers
there
the
pictures
of
dead
heroes
were
displayed
in
a
kind
of
public
agony
and
many
small
towns
that
had
predicted
nothing
but
disaster
for
some
young
no
good
now
proudly
published
his
picture
and
nobody
in
the
entire
town
gave
a
damn
except
that
it
made
their
village
important
the
marines
were
intimately
a
part
of
the
population
the
notice
of
death
did
not
arrive
for
it
was
unprecedented
to
hold
that
any
soldier
could
have
owed
allegiance
to
two
different
nations
so
anne
neville
lived
a
desperate
fear
afraid
to
call
the
american
headquarters
for
she
was
not
married
to
her
marine
she
received
an
ugly
fright
one
morning
when
an
american
staff
car
pulled
up
at
the
cottage
a
major
in
his
middle
thirties
pompous
and
plump
knocked
at
the
door
and
announced
himself
as
major
harding
is
miss
anne
neville
at
home
anne
in
whom
pregnancy
had
started
in
earnest
felt
faint
and
was
unable
to
speak
but
barbara
standing
beside
her
said
this
is
my
sister
she
s
anne
neville
with
extraordinary
politeness
the
major
found
two
chairs
then
sitting
very
straight
on
a
third
he
said
you
must
take
this
interviewvery
seriously
a
great
deal
depends
upon
this
interview
please
barbara
said
barbara
the
major
stared
at
anne
and
asked
your
age
she
s
thirty
barbara
said
please
the
major
said
stiffly
would
miss
anne
neville
please
reply
born
ferrymead
barbara
responded
the
major
carefully
placed
his
pen
in
his
notebook
and
said
the
record
must
be
precise
and
in
your
sister
s
own
words
otherwise
we
shall
be
able
to
do
nothing
for
her
your
father
living
no
anne
said
cautiously
his
occupation
when
living
a
captain
barbara
exploded
a
captain
in
the
royal
navy
the
major
wrote
rapidly
that
is
important
that
s
going
to
help
a
great
deal
your
religion
church
of
england
anne
said
i
guess
that
s
what
we
call
episcopalian
the
major
said
i
m
baptist
myself
you
girls
lived
here
for
some
time
thirty
years
no
look
miss
neville
i
do
nt
like
this
any
more
than
you
do
besides
i
m
asking
your
sister
would
your
minister
be
willing
to
swear
that
you
were
of
good
christian
reputation
yes
anne
said
quietly
the
major
sighed
and
smiled
at
the
sisters
that
s
that
dreadful
questions
but
i
m
going
to
break
a
confidence
and
say
right
out
that
you
re
as
good
as
married
what
do
you
mean
anne
asked
miss
neville
the
major
said
rising
and
extending
his
hand
in
ten
minutes
i
m
going
to
cable
noumea
and
recommend
without
qualification
your
marriage
to
lieutenant
bates
and
in
the
meantime
the
american
government
wants
to
give
you
this
present
anne
unfolded
the
parcel
and
read
the
book
s
title
w
p
a
guide
to
oklahoma
what
s
this
she
asked
if
you
re
going
to
live

be
prepared
when
you
get
there
and
tomorrow
night
you

the
young
eagles
club

what
barbara
asked
but
the
major
was
already
in
his
good

very
lucky

a
fine
good
looking
girl

i
m
telling
you

practically
an
american
miss
neville
then
maybe
you
could
help
us
barbara
asked
hesitatingly
at
your
service
once
you
pass
the
investigation
we
ll
do
anything
within
reason
we
want
you
to
like
america
anne
s
future
husband
lieutenant
bates
he
s
on
tarawa
the
pompousness
and
the
major
ness
evaporated
and
harding
banged
his
leg
oh

it
he
groaned
why

he
snapped
you

had
let
us

the
lists

there
anything
we
might
do
barbara
asked
not
a
damn
thing
the
major
sighed
then
suddenly
he
jammed
his
hat
on
his
head
and
asked
is
that
the
phone
there
on
the
corner
yes
barbara
said
leading
him
to
the
bright
red
kiosk
major
harding
pushed
his
way
in
jangled
the
hook
and
stuck
his
head
out
the
door
how
do
you
work
these
damned
gook
phones
he
asked
barbara
laughed
and
said
they
re
difficult
then
she
showed
him
how
to
deposit
the
pennies
and
listened
as
he
stormed
at
headquarters
about
the
casualty
lists
from
tarawa
damn
it
she
heard
him
shout
these
are
fine
girls

this
morning

as
fine
as
any
american
girl

and

nt
sure

ever

have
you
met

situation
before
barbara
asked
he
looked
down
at
her
with
the
worn
out
patience
of
a
businessman
trying
to
explain
to
his
wife
what
had
happened
at
the
office
have
i
met
it
lady
the
last
four
marriages
i
ve
investigated

the
play
but
what
would
be
the
point
of
that
it
would
go
most
likely
but
that
would
nt
mean
anything
either
the
play
does
nt
say
anything
it
does
nt
say
anything
in
the
words
and
it
does
nt
say
anything
in
the
stuff
that
s
not
in
the
words

he
said
thanks
for
asking
me
that
s
what
happens
pit
is
nt
much
item
by
item
but
it
mounts
up
it
mounts
up
it
winks
and
mounts
up
and
a
man
smiles
as
he
shuts
his
eyes
to
see
if
he
can
sleep
a
moment
in
the
afternoon
since
he
ca
nt
at
night
he
shuts
his
eyes
and
falls
into
something
that
is
almost
but
not
quite
sleep
he
falls
into
remembering
is
it
means
something
perhapssomething
fine
only
a
man
ca
nt
make
out
what
it
means
he
ca
nt
make
it
out
for
the
winking
and
the
mounting
up
of
it
whatever
the
time
of
him
a
man
is
his
own
poor
friend
his
own
proud
stranger
his
own
cunning
enemy
watching
with
sharp
eyes
his
mother
s
own
son
it
is
himself
who
is
the
luckiest
man
as
he
himself
knows
it
is
his
own
half
words
and
half
acts
left
in
half
places
at
half
times
that
grow
whole
in
all
men
winking
in
them
and
in
their
children
for
a
man
is
the
race
every
one
of
him
is
the
race
and
each
is
good
each
is
innocent
each
is
winked
into
his
own
innocence
as
he
himself
knows
a
man
lives
out
his
time
in
secret
leaving
behind
no
word
of
what
he
was
or
did
or
knew
or
leaving
only
half
a
word
mixed
with
coughing
or
laughter
or
half
an
act
of
dancing
on
the
floor
and
loved
the
promise
of
time
and
the
world
he
had
almost
fallen
asleep
when
he
heard
the
knock
at
the
door

in

said
paul
key

son

best
when

too
we
do
it
all
the
time
it
is
nt
good
enough

always
seems
as
if
it
may
turn
out
all
right
at
last
and
then
it
turns
out
bad
again
i
ca
nt
decide
what
to
do
david
said
about
what
to
do
what
my
father
did
david
said
if
he
made
pictures
he
knew
were
bad
what
shall
i
do
and
listen
to
all
this
bernice
mrs
foreman
said
quietly
i
think
the
stew
is
almost
done
look
at
it
bernice
please
do
nt
leave
your
skates
and
jumping
rope
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
anyone
can
trip
over
them
mrs
foreman
and
agnes
were
talking
more
quietly
now
she
was
in
bernice
s
class
last
term
i
do
nt
know
how
a
girl
that
age
could
possibly
she
s
fourteen
mrs
foreman
sighed
and
oscar
s
sixteen
i
to
court
he
did
agnes
she
s
just
trying
to
humiliate
us
leave
her
alone
god
knows
popa
has
nt
one
cent
to
give
her
there
was
a
pause
before
mrs
foreman
spoke
again
i
wish
we
could
send
him
away
to
one
of
those
schools
he
s
getting
worse
every
day
i
do
nt
think
he
ll
graduate
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
he
stays
out
so
late
and
wo
nt
mind
anything
wrong
mama
no
i
just
felt
dizzy
why
do
nt
you
lie
down
agnes
voice
was
so
quiet
now
they
had
nt
even
mentioned
the
ink
besides
popa
will
be
home
soon
i
want
to
be
on
my
feet
when
he
comes
in
agnes
coin
spilled
ink
all
over
his
suit
at
school
today
he
had
to
empty
ink
from
one
of
those
big
bottles
into
a
small
well
now
it
was
coming
he
began
to
nt
cry
when
agnes
slapped
him
teachers
should
nt
send
a
boy
that
age
after
ink
those
bottles
are
so
awkward
he
was
nt
going
to
get
a
slap
after
all
she
was
thinking
about
the
problem
of
oscar
and
ink
was
nothing
when
it
came
to
thinking
about
oscar
in
a
way
he
was
sorry
because
he
was
prepared
to
take
the
punishment
and
now
he
d
have
to
wait
until
popa
came
home
and
he
was
sure
to
notice
even
if
they
did
nt
say
one
word
agnes
slap
was
nothing
to
popa
s
strap
funny
thing
that
oscar
never
got
a
whipping
maybe
because
he
was
named
after
popa
oscar
emerson
foreman
junior
ppo
pa
liked
to
call
him
by
the
whole
name
each
time
it
sounded
like
a
roll
call
in
school
a
lot
of
first
names
run
together
maybe
oscar
was
too
strong
for
popa
no
popa
was
nt
afraid
of
anything
or
anybody
not
even
mr
courtland
and
he
worked
for
him
coin
had
heard
his
supper
for
sending
him
to
long
island
for
strawberries
or
something
from
a
hothouse
right
in
the
middle
of
winter
or
that
night
he
had
to
go
to
washington
unexpectedly
and
was
forced
to
postpone
his
installation
as
president
of
the
society
of
the
sons
of
virginia
did
popa
curse
then
he
must
ve
been
mad
hell
and
damn
he
had
snapped
out
because
of
mr
courtland
popa
did
nt
fear
oscar
coin
glanced
up
suddenly
at
the
ceiling
and
was
sure
he
saw
oscar
s
face
just
as
plain
or
was
it
a
bulldog
closing
his
eyes
he
counted
to
seventeen
opened
them
again
yes
that
was
his
brother
all
right
and
he
was
laughing
down
at
him
brown
and
gray
coin
gaped
back
real
hard
but
oscar
would
nt
stop
laughing
so
he
crossed
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
with
glee
and
stuck
his
tongue
out
for
good
measure
dear
heavenly
father
make
us
truly
grateful
for
this
food
which
we
are
about
to
receive
for
the
nourishment
of
our
bodies
for
the
name
of
thy
son
christ
jesus
who
died
on
the
cross
that
we
might
live
amen
mr
foreman
invariably
said
grace
in
megaphone
tones
to
coin
he
sounded
like
he
was
praying
before
the
whole
sundaypschool
or
wanted
mrs
renaldo
upstairs
to
hear
or
the
bernsteins
across
the
airshaft
to
bow
their
heads
with
agnes
and
mama
and
woody
and
bernice
and
sometimesoscar
the
loud
deep
tobacco
voice
signified
prayer
over
more
than
a
simple
stew
the
comport
seemed
to
grow
large
enough
to
include
fried
chicken
corn
on
the
cob
candied
sweets
rice
ice
cream
walnut
cake
and
all
the
crisp
eager
amen
caused
every
sort
of
good
juice
to
flow
in
his
mouth
his
father
prayed
over
mountains
of
food
and
every
kind
was
coin
s
favorite
the
gaslight
spreading
shadows
and
highlights
around
the
room
helped
reinforce
other
illusions
too
for
instance
popa
s
diploma
from
wayland
seminary
was
a
window
in
the
misty
corner
near
the
kitchen
door
reflecting
wrinkled
gaslights
like
three
little
with
the
ugly
red
and
purple
flowers
in
a
green
field
faded
into
mysterious
owl
forests
the
picture
of
the
last
judgment
above
the
buffet
appreciated
the
prayer
and
christ
s
outstretched
hands
suffered
little
children
to
come
unto
him
instead
of
striking
at
the
wicked
in
their
downward
fall
momps
his
voice
had
a
little
bit
of
ha
ha
in
it
where
s
the
napkins
he
reared
back
in
his
chair
smiling
of
course
they
did
nt
have
any
but
popa
seemed
to
think
so
and
that
mama
was
just
too
stingy
to
use
them
they
re
in
the
same
place
popa
bernice
fetch
the
napkins
bernice
went
to
the
buffet
and
took
nothing
out
of
the
top
drawer
and
handed
each
one
some
air
shaped
like
a
napkin
coin
thought
that
was
the
biggest
joke
as
mr
foreman
lifted
the
covering
to
the
comport
and
sniffed
lima
bean
stew
woody
leaned
over
to
coin
and
whispered
beans
beans
the
musical
fruit
nobody
heard
for
mr
foreman
s
mouth
worked
out
large
fat
ohs
and
as
momps
he
called
this
smells
mighty
tempting
might
be
forced
to
take
a
second
helping
yes
sir
re
bob
i
might
be
forced
to
do
that
steam
smoked
his
small
black
hedge
of
mustache
the
two
boys
still
giggled
over
their
rhyme
and
bernice
joined
them
after
repeating
yes
sir
re
bob
in
what
she
thought
was
a
deep
voice
her
upper
teeth
thrust
forward
catching
the
light
gave
her
an
extra
lip
white
and
while
they
had
played
the
guard
bugler
had
sounded
a
watery
tattoo
from
the
corner
of
the
rainy
muddy
quad
and
there
had
been
a
sudden
influx
of
last
minute
pissers
before
they
went
to
bed
and
the
cq
had
come
around
and
thrown
the
light
switches
in
the
squadrooms
saloon
doors
of
the
latrine
there
were
the
heavy
silences
and
soft
stirrings
of
a
great
deal
of
sleep
but
the
game
had
gone
on
concentratedly
through
it
all
with
that
passionate
singularity
generally
attributed
to
love
but
which
few
men
ever
feel
for
women
i
might
of
knew
it
maggio
said
dejectedly
he
pulled
down
the
strap
of
his
undershirt
and
scratched
his
bony
shoulder
tragically
toolong
any
man

an
ace
paired
on
the
last

his
hand

pvt
readall
treadwell
the
sixth
man
who
had
not
won
a
single
hand
and
who
came
from
southern
pennsylvania
he
heaved
the
fat
lined
barrel
that
was
his
chest
and
belly
in
a
lazy
sigh
and
turned
over
his
cards
and
tossed
them
in
his
round
face
grinned
lazily
belying
the
swiftness
of
little
maggio
he
was
like
a
fat
cross
legged
buddha
you

an
i
aim

em
not
you
ah
cant
play
poker
no
ways
hell
no
maggio
agreed
all
so
far
outside
the
normal
it
was
capable
of
being
a
failure
and
a
mistake
for
a
moment
ericson
wondered
if
at
a
later
date
when
gregg
had
forgotten
the
worst
of
this
matter
he
might
translate
the
occasion
into
different
terms
perhaps
boasting
cheekily
in
the
mess
decks
trouble
not
me
the
skipper
gave
me
a
tot
of
whisky
and
told
me
to
come
back
any
time
but
no
it
would
nor
be
like
that
the
giving
of
the
whisky
seemed
to
surprise
gregg
into
an
effort
of
control
as
he
sipped
it
looking
round
the
cabin
and
out
through
the
sunlit
porthole
his
mouth
and
face
firmed
again
and
he
prepared
to
go
on
what
he
had
said
and
what
he
had
still
to
say
was
desolate
but
not
too
desolate
for
ordered
speech
it
was
possible
he
had
thought
that
his
wife
might
be
at
though
she
had
said
nothing
about
going
she
was
in
the
mood
for
impulsive
action
so
to
edgware
he
went
by
bus
only
to
draw
another
blank
she
was
nt
there
and
she
had
nt
been
there
for
weeks
i
could
see
her
mother
thought
it
was
funny
but
i
was
nt
answering
any
questions
then
i
went
to
see
my
pal
the
one
that
wrote
the
letter
but
he
d
gone
back
after
his
leave
and
they
did
nt
know
anything
so
i
left
it
and
went
home
again
he
had
been
alone
in
the
empty
silent
house
for
a
week
as
he
dismissed
it
thus
in
a
single
sentence
lricson
tried
to
visualize
what
it
must
have
been
like
the
waiting
the
loneliness
the
suspicion
the
knowledge
of
betrayal
i
had
to
stay
sir
in
case
she
came
back
he
said
and
ericson
could
not
for
pity
deny
the
claim
i
d
have
gone
to
look
there
was
the
whole
of
london
and
then
i
got
an
idea
i
should
have
thought
of
it
before
there
was
a
married
friend
of
hers
woman
i
never
cared
for
over
the
other
side
of
london
down
white
city
way
i
thought
she
might
be
staying
there
so
i
went
over
and
asked
at
the
house
she
said
the
wife
had
been
there
a
few
days
back
but
had
gone
away
again
she
did
nt
know
where
the
story
was
pouring
out
now
unchecked
by
any
reserve
in
the
silent
cabin
the
words
and
sentences
clumsy
and
ill
formed
yet
flowed
with
an
eloquent
readiness
towardstheir
cruel
end
i
thought
she
was
telling
lies
there
was
something
in
the
way
she
looked
so
i
hung
about
a
bit
watching
for
the
car
and
then
i
turned
into
the
first
pub
i
came
to
for
a
pint
and
something
to
eat
and
there
they
were
the
two
of
them
sitting
she
was
laughing
and
then
she
looked
up
and
said
look
who
s
here
ericson
thought
he
was
going
to
stop
as
he
had
stopped
many
times
before
but
the
whisky
had
done
its
work
or
perhaps
it
was
the
story
itself
which
could
not
be
delayed
at
so
crucial
a
point
i
asked
what
she
was
doing
there
instead
of
being
at
home
gregg
went
on
immediately
and
she
said
there
was
no
harm
in
having
a
drink
then
i
said
where
ve
you
been
the
last
week
and
she
said
staying
with
else
that
s
this
woman
i
said
i
was
nt
going
to
stand
for
it
and
the
man
said
what
you
need
is
a
drink
i
said
i
do
nt
want
a
drink
from
you
if
this
goes
on
i
m
going
to
see
about
a
divorce
i
did
nt
really
mean
it
i
just
wanted
to
give
him
a
scare
he
i
said
how
about
you
coming
down
the
stairs
that
night
and
he
said
i
was
just
saying
good
night
to
mrs
gregg
it
was
quite
inno
the
cruel
sea
i
i
grapplingcent
and
then
he
winked
at
her
and
she
laughed
like
a
like
a
rotten
tart
what
an
accurate
description
thought
ericson
how
can
he
want
her
now
how
can
he
feel
anything
but
hatred
and
disgust
but
in
gregg
s
voice
there
was
neither
of
these
when
he
said
rotten
tart
he
was
not
condemning
he
was
mourning
what
he
and
she
had
lost
there
was
no
trace
of
rationality
in
it
no
balancing
of
right
and
wrong
there
was
simply
the
incalculable
instinct
of
love
of
what
people
feel
or
feel
that
they
should
feel
when
they
undertaketo
bind
themselves
to
other
people
even
now
it
seemed
gregg
did
not
question
the
validity
of
that
binding
the
bargain
might
be
bad
this
sprang
from
love
a
word
in
a
book
a
scene
in
a
film
a
foolish
core
of
determination
in
a
man
s
brain
gregg
was
continuing
with
quiet
assurance
i
was
going
to
say
something
to
him
about
that
sir
but
then
he
said
you
need
nt
worry
anyway
i
m
off
to
the
states
next
week
big
buying
job
and
the
wife
said
first
i
ve
heard
of
it
walter
when
are
you
going
and
he
said
thursday
i
ll
come
round
to
say
good
bye
and
i
said
like
hell
you
will
you
do
nt
come
near
the
house
again
it
was
funny
sir
he
did
nt
try
to
argue
the
toss
about
that
he
just
said
i
lave
it
your
own
way
then
i
think
what
i
said
about
the
divorce
must
have
rattled
him
a
bit
but
perhaps
he
d
had
enough
of
it
anyway
then
he
stood
up
see
you
again
one
of
these
days
and
she
said
very
surprised
do
you
mean
good
bye
walter
and
he
walked
off
and
by
and
by
she
started
crying
and
i
took
her
home
at
that
gregg
paused
and
looked
at
ericson
as
if
judging
how
he
would
receive
what
he
was
going
to
say
next
he
was
near
the
end
now
and
he
must
in
spite
of
his
honor
of
your
excellency
s
letters
and
am
sorry
to
find
that
a
man
of
such
high
rank
should
descend
so
far
as
to
use
intelligences
which
he
confesses
came
to
him
in
an
indirect
way
british
admirals
are
responsible
to
none
but
their
sovereign
and
their
country
and
were
never
known
to
insult
an
open
and
declared
enemy
but
and
traitors
and
rebels
to
their
king
deserve
no
consideration
and
none
shall
they
ever
meet
with
at
my
hands
i
must
again
repeat
to
your
excellency
that
i
can
no
longer
permit
flags
of
truce
to
pass
between
the
king
my
master
s
islands
and
those
of
the
french
this
communication
i
am
determined
to
prevent
and
i
have
given
orders
to
all
my
cruisers
to
seize
and
detain
all
flags
of
truce
but
such
as
general
vaughn
and
myself
may
be
honoured
with
from
you
without
exception
it
was
signed
g
b
rodney
barney
looked
up
this
spoils
your
intelligence
system
he
could
nt
help
smiling
the
marquis
was
in
no
smiling
mood
that
sanctimonious
devil
he
said
has
refused
to
exchange
prisoners
and
the
french
merchants
on
stasia
according
to
him
they
come
under
these
he
tapped
the
letter
perfidious
people
i
have
replied
i
have
replied
thus
said
the
marquis
calming
down
a
little
writing
i
am
satisfied
that
a
british
admiral
ought
to
be
responsible
to
his
king
and
country
to
both
i
owe
reprisals
they
shall
be
forthcoming
you
have
set
the
example
and
i
shall
pursue
it
he
looked
up
at
barney
over
the
letter
to
punctuate
this
he
went
on
i
repeat
once
more
that
you
may
act
as
you
please
towards
our
flags
of
truce
to
quiet
your
apprehensions
on
that
score
i
shall
send
no
more
in
the
future
the
interpretations
of
our
sentiments
shall
be
our
cannon
very
much
to
the
point
m
lord
barney
said
crossing
long
legs
from
outside
in
the
gardens
came
the
sound
of
hammering
as
the
construction
of
a
dance
floor
under
the
palms
went
on
six
hundred
people
had
been
invited
to
a
reception
for
the
comte
de
grasse
and
his
officers
tonight
the
marquis
laid
the
letter
down
you
will
miss
the
festivities
sir
he
said
i
am
sorry
again
there
can
be
no
possible
doubt
but
that
francois
was
caught
on
stasia
and
now
lurks
somewhere
in
the
hills
with
the
americans
mr
ross
in
his
last
communication
the
marquis
grimaced
supposed
there
to
be
from
three
to
four
hundred
of
them
but
they
surrender
daily
starved
feverish
rodney
has
arrested
curyon
and
gouvernier
and
sent
them
as
prisoners
of
state
to
england
for
treasonable
trading
with
the
enemy
all
goods
including
those
of
french
merchants
have
been
confiscated
the
food
is
even
doled
out
to
each
household
when
they
are
deported
they
may
take
only
household
goods
and
household
slaves
with
them
rodney
is
also
after
the
englishmen
who
became
dutch
burghers
to
enjoy
the
trading
air
of
stasia
the
marquis
smiled
all
canoes
have
to
be
drawn
up
on
the
beaches
before
dark
fort
oranje
now
boasts
forty
ten
pounders
batteries
are
being
constructed
we
re
not
quite
sure
where
i
do
nt
wonder
rodney
the
marquis
said
we
must
keep
communications
open
the
situation
now
is
that
we
can
watch
hood
and
his
fleet
since
they
retreated
to
st
lucia
we
must
devise
means
to
watch
stasia
i
have
requested
captain
connor
to
attend
us
he
waits
the
marquis
crossed
the
floor
and
opened
a
door
barney
waited
for
the
sight
of
the
man
who
was
to
accompany
him
on
his
next
mission
connor
was
irish
with
freckles
and
hazel
eyes
a
scar
marked
one
cheek
adventurer
and
professional
soldier
he
commanded
the
marquis
garrison
of
some
five
hundred
men
he
wore
a
resplendent
uniform
dark
blue
with
red
facings
with
a
line
of
white
down
neat
trouser
leg
captain
connor
barney
said
bowing
as
soon
as
you
two
have
said
hello
we
will
get
down
to
business
the
marquis
said
and
went
over
to
the
wall
and
unrolled
a
magnificent
map
of
the
islands
which
covered
almost
one
whole
wall
barney
till
the
three
of
them
stood
in
front
of
it
the
marquis
with
a
long
wand
in
hand
looked
at
both
of
them
and
smiled
with
satisfaction
you
are
two
aces
i
have
against
the
british
sirs
he
said
and
his
smile
was
delighted
now
attendez
here
are
we
the
marquis
loved
his
maps
and
he
loved
strategy
with
machiavellian
fervor
he
was
enjoying
himself
this
morning
it
was
with
some
regret
he
realized
his
correspondence
with
rodney
was
at
an
end
however
the
bullets
would
come
next
as
he
had
promised
here
are
we
and
de
grasse
and
twenty
some
ships
of
the
line
besides
my
four
frigates
here
is
hood
close
he
pointed
to
st
lucia
hood
is
kept
under
surveillance
at
all
times
that
surveillance
was
good
barney
knew
good
and
accurate
it
was
going
to
allow
him
to
proceed
with
assurance
that
he
was
not
bearding
hood
and
the
went
on
here
is
stasia
saba
and
st
martin
a
stone
s
throw
from
st
kitts
and
nevis
in
british
hands
we
watch
from
guadeloupe
one
moment
connor
said
once
we
take
stasia
back
we
are
free
to
include
st
kitts
and
nevis
in
the
same
bundle
my
lord
they
go
together
later
said
the
marquis
then
he
said
you
understand
i
have
no
say
he
gestured
as
to
the
doings
of
the
fleet
and
le
comte
de
grasse
i
tell
you
confidentially
we
must
do
all
this
out
here
in
the
islands
ourselves
the
fleet
serves
as
a
balance
wheel
only
a
big
one
said
barney
and
connor
nodded
may
i
smoke
m
lord
he
asked
and
knowing
the
answer
would
be
in
the
affirmative
got
out
his
pipe
he
filled
it
abstractedly
he
said
the
damage
done
by
the
yanks
to
now
the
regiments
which
general
vaughn
is
leaving
on
stasia
d
talk
to
him
he
d
imagined
that
meeting
her
would
change
his
life
and
this
had
all
happened
when
his
old
man
had
been
hitting
the
bottle
heavily
in
those
days
he
d
often
cowered
in
fear
of
his
father
and
he
d
sometimes
blamed
his
mother
for
not
protecting
him
this
was
all
so
far
away
now
it
was
gone
he
was
bringing
it
back
in
memory
recreating
it
in
words
all
the
fears
and
hopes
all
that
hungering
and
dreaming
for
love
little
philip
would
have
his
own
boyhood
he
would
try
to
make
it
different
from
his
different
from
his
own
lost
and
betrayed
past
bernard
sometimes
i
think
you
do
nt
care
for
anyone
but
yourself
elizabeth
said
in
great
irritation
doing
my
work
is
nt
a
matter
of
this
quarrel
seemed
so
childish
that
he
could
nt
respond
to
elizabeth
s
anger
it
was
a
beautiful
peaceful
night
and
they
were
taking
a
walk
along
seventy
first
people
were
strolling
about
lazily
there
was
really
nothing
for
them
to
quarrel
over
their
baby
was
home
asleep
and
if
he
needed
anything
mr
whelan
was
there
to
take
care
of
him
bernard
felt
good
he
wanted
to
wander
about
with
elizabeth
to
make
the
most
of
this
aimless
walk
to
absorb
the
evening
but
here
they
were
quarreling
and
he
did
nt
know
what
it
was
all
about
you
re
always
talking
about
your
work
and
having
to
work
and
of
course
i
want
you
to
and
i
let
you
work
but
what
about
me
honey
you
know
i
love
you
bernard
carr
you
know
you
just
did
nt
want
to
go
out
for
a
drive
with
my
father
and
mother
you
know
it
just
as
sure
as
you
know
there
s
not
true
he
answered
it
is
and
you
know
it
is
and
you
were
mean
mean
and
selfish
tonight
but
i
asked
you
and
you
said
it
was
all
right
if
i
did
nt
come
along
now
you
want
to
fight
with
me
anyway
someone
had
to
stay
home
with
the
baby
we
could
have
taken
the
baby
along
an
elderly
couple
turned
to
stare
at
them
and
bernard
was
embarrassed
honey
please
let
s
drop
it
it
s
a
beautiful
night
let
s
enjoy
it
and
cut
out
this
idiotic
quarreling
father
and
mother
have
been
very
nice
to
both
of
us
i
did
nt
do
anything
to
them
they
did
nt
seem
to
mind
my
staying
home
well
i
just
happen
to
know
that
they
did
did
they
say
anything
no
they
never
talk
about
you
except
to
praise
you
even
after
what
you
did
and
she
was
telling
me
how
i
should
see
topit
that
you
ate
the
right
food
so
you
d
be
healthy
and
you
act
as
if
you
did
nt
like
my
father
i
do
nt
dislike
him
you
are
nt
even
careful
and
tactful
in
what
you
say
to
him
when
was
i
tactless
and
why
in
hell
do
i
always
have
to
be
tactful
let
others
be
tactful
sometimes
instead
of
my
always
sparing
their
ideas
and
feelings
and
prejudices
let
them
consider
mine
if
someone
else
expresses
ideas
i
do
nt
like
why
should
nt
i
tell
them
what
i
think
instead
of
consideringwhether
my
ideas
will
make
them
angry
i
never
knew
you
could
be
so
mean
she
seemed
about
to
burst
into
tears
and
this
is
the
way
you
treat
me
when
i
ask
you
to
take
me
out
for
a
walk
well
i
am
taking
you
out
for
a
walk
yes
but
you
re
me
i
m
not
fighting
with
you
i
did
nt
start
it
you
did
people
are
looking
at
us
you
do
nt
want
to
scandalize
the
neighborhood
do
you
bernard
carr
i
hate
you
they
turned
the
corner
at
jeffery
avenue
i
would
nt
have
said
a
thing
if
you
d
only
acted
just
a
little
different
with
mother
and
father
honey
this
is
silly
it
s
idiotic
let
s
stop
it
and
but
bernard
you
were
nasty
to
me
no
more
than
you
were
to
me
he
determined
not
to
become
annoyed
bernard
even
though
i
am
your
wife
i
do
nt
think
you
think
i
m
important
maybe
you
do
nt
think
anyone
is
important
just
your
work
he
took
her
and
kissed
her
she
melted
with
pleasure
you
kissed
me
on
jeffery
avenue
she
said
coyly
her
on
toward
jackson
park
laughing
together
they
were
sitting
on
bernard
s
coat
rumpled
and
silent
elizabeth
lay
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
though
he
felt
at
peace
with
the
world
at
the
same
time
he
felt
disillusioned
he
thought
of
death
if
it
could
come
at
such
a
time
as
this
in
a
sweetness
of
fatigue
and
spent
emotions
a
slow
and
painless
exhaustion
here
where
he
d
dreamed
of
love
as
a
boy
here
and
now
when
the
world
was
so
beautiful
and
peaceful
the
blue
sky
was
lavish
with
stars
and
trees
darkness
a
blue
gray
mist
and
moonlight
soft
winds
from
lake
michigan
playing
on
the
leaves
and
running
so
caressingly
through
his
hair
they
had
come
here
to
his
special
spot
in
jackson
park
they
had
kissed
and
loved
and
abandoned
themselves
to
each
other
and
they
had
been
as
close
and
as
ecstatic
as
it
was
possible
to
be
and
now
they
sat
close
together
silent
and
sleepy
there
was
no
more
than
this
under
the
stars
and
then
to
sit
under
these
same
stars
and
with
resignation
to
know
that
there
was
no
more
this
this
was
all
there
could
be
and
this
too
was
the
real
content
of
those
boyhood
dreams
elizabeth
breathing
softly
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
had
given
him
what
he
d
wanted
from
elsie
cavanagh
she
had
made
his
boyhood
dreams
come
true
almost
all
his
dreams
had
come
true
he
d
found
the
limit
of
his
dreams
this
was
it
this
tired
bye
did
nt
i
see
a
mr
mrs
sign
on
your
mail
box
protection
against
call
girls
david
said
quickly
well
you
ca
nt
blame
my
being
curious
i
ve
heard
you
play
in
concert
and
several
times
i
was
within
an
inch
of
coming
down
here
and
asking
you
out
for
a
ride
in
my
red
convertible
but
the
weird
sisters
indicating
meg
and
louisa
told
me
not
to
disturb
you
but
i

big
enough
to
understand

nt
born

sort
of
menage

called

boston
marriage

the
subdued

of

witty
showtune

by

to
calm
the

at

a
charleston

from
wellesley
twenty
years

the
raccoon

hip
flasks

observable
too
that
meg
was
no
little
involved
with
dick
dobbs
she
breathed
heavily
for
his
skivvy
shirt
but
david
had
a
suspicion
that
dick
was
the
turbaned
negress
for
his
toys

run
at
her
sandaled
feet
with
their
onyx
toenails

lil
ole
me
after
a
few
drinks
olivia
lapsed
into
skittishness
and
her
mammy
s
accent
isobel
had
told
david
that
at
olivia
s
own
parties
frequented
by
upper
class
negroes
and
singers
and
left
wing
poets
she
was
accustomed
to
change
her
costumeat
least
three
times
hostessing
it
in
the
grand
manner
of
an
old
south
that
had
exploited
her
and
hers
lovely
party
mrs
murray
said
tentatively
to
mrs
joy
who
was
also
beginning
to
nap
from
the
liquor
well
yes
mrs
murray
out
of
all
due
politeness
to
your
boy
but
in
my
day
as
in
yours
things
were
simpler
we
just
sang
musical
chairs
i
just
do
nt
follow
all
the
jabber
at
these
parties
i
get
the
feeling
these
young
folks
are
talking
a
private
language
something
sinister
murmured
mrs
murray
who
had
often
had
the
same
feeling
of
helplessness
you
may
say
that
dearie
said
mrs
joy
shutting
her
eyes
again
and
father
rushton
watched
watched
watched
and
louisa
was
holding
a
conversation
in
which
she
did
nt
propose
to
be
interrupted
for
the
world
she
was
goading
tom
bernstein
and
the
priest
into
heady
discussions
of
the
church
the
theater
and
the
welfare
state
the
frivolity
of
her
profession
as
buyer
for
rich
and
silly
women
had
goaded
her
new
england
conscience
into
an
excessive
concern
for
the
welfare
of
people
she
did
nt
know
and
would
nt
like
if
she
did
know
since
they
were
unwashed
and
poorly
dressed
a
crime
in
louisa
s
professional
eyes
the
more
louisa
s
salary
at
the
department
store
went
up
the
more
she
felt
spurred
to
david
had
been
watching
the
rancor
between
tom
bernstein
and
louisa
ebb
and
flow
that
soured
understanding
between
two
ex
lovers
louisa
was
just
beyond
her
bloom
he
guessed
that
five
years
ago
she
must
have
been
to
tom
a
musky
mistress
with
all
the
libertine
jollity
that
is
usually
imputed
to
an
artist
s
model
torn
duckie
louisa
said
do
nt
you
ever
tire
of
being
sententious
the
young
man
has
something
to
say
said
father
rushton
well
father
when
you
ve
been
listening
to
his
blather
for
years
as
i
have
but
tom
s
studied
baritone
drawled
on
like
an
actor
fearful
of
having
his
cue
jumped
i
appeal
to
you
padre
what
gets
me
about
the
church
is
that
it
s
such
damn
good
theater
i
understand
that
damn
pis
not
offensive
to
catholics
as
long
as
it
does
nt
have
for
subject
the
deity
the
mass
is
the
greatest
drama
in
the
world
my
son
but
it
s
so
his
subject
he
was
wearing
a
lapelless
jacket
of
fawn
colored
suede
he
had
an
ascot
with
a
stickpin
at
his
throat
his
shoes
were
also
of
suede
well
what
i
mean
is
the
church
has
provided
herself
with
a
first
rate
scenario
of
course
she
ought
to
have
she
s
had
rehearsal
time
enough
unlike
most
broadway
shows
what
with
rising
production
costs
and
look
at
the
cast
of
characters
padre
the
son
of
god
himself
i
believe
that
s
the
christian
interpretation
of
jesus
christ
mrs
murray
and
mrs
joy
as
they
had
been
taught
to
do
bowed
their
heads
with
father
rushton
and
three
priests
in
gothic
vestments
and
gregorian
showtunes
that
have
lasted
six
hundred
years
and
pretty
choirboys
in
red
and
white
and
best
of
all
an
audience
that
packs
the
house
every
sunday
morning
with
a
willing
suspension
of
their
disbelief
which
is
something
you
rarely
get
in
the
theater
yes
sir
god
the
for
a
longer
run
father
rushton
may
find
your
analogy
embarrassingly
secular
said
louisa
winking
at
david
not
too
much
so
my
daughter
holy
mother
church
seizes
on
any
metaphor
that
will
serve
to
explain
her
message
to
generation
after
generation
of
converts
who
s
talking
of
converts
louisa
laughed
she
brought
them
obediently
and
sherry
pulled
the
cork
from
steaming
strong
black
coffee
he
sniffed
at
the
aroma
as
he
lifted
the
cup
hey
this
hits
the
spot
on
a
wet
night
how
about
you
kid
you
like
some
coffee
or
a
beer
or
something
no
i
do
nt
want
nothin
tude
said
she
watched
him
as
he
drank
and
then
held
the
thick
white
cup
between
his
hands
for
a
moment
before
he
drank
again
she
moved
off
a
little
lighting
a
cigarette
and
putting
it
down
smoothing
quickly
and
carefully
at
her
hair
where
it
was
combed
up
sleek
over
the
back
of
her
head
sherry
added
more
coffee
and
then
brandy
to
his
cup
and
sampledit
again
you
know
this
is
really
nice
he
said
in
the
silence
coming
home
and
finding
you
up
and
having
something
to
eat
like
this
why
you
wanta
say
that
she
said
you
kiddin
me
or
somep
n
i
m
not
kidding
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
silently
and
then
moved
away
with
her
strange
dawdling
walk
tidying
the
pile
of
magazines
on
the
library
table
again
automatically
and
tweaking
and
straightening
at
the
dusty
drapes
come
on
sit
down
he
said
i
ll
let
you
try
a
slug
of
my
coffee
if
you
want
to
she
did
not
answer
him
prowling
on
around
the
room
her
face
tense
and
preoccupied
sherry
did
not
speak
again
but
he
watched
her
when
his
cup
was
empty
he
replenished
it
from
the
bottle
and
the
coffee
pot
and
then
he
leaned
back
in
the
chair
loosening
his
tie
and
shirt
collar
settling
down
so
that
his
body
was
slouched
and
comfortable
while
the
rain
pattered
against
the
windows
okay
what
s
the
pitch
he
said
finally
his
voice
soft
what
you
got
on
your
mind
anyway
tude
stopped
still
glancing
at
him
quickly
over
her
shoulder
and
then
away
what
you
may
as
well
get
it
over
with
and
relax
what
was
all
this
for
anyway
tude
turned
and
stood
for
a
moment
her
eyes
wide
open
her
body
tensing
and
gathering
together
she
sucked
in
a
great
breath
of
air
and
then
came
to
him
running
flinging
herself
upon
him
her
body
pressing
and
caressing
and
urging
her
arms
tight
over
his
shoulders
sherry
sat
motionless
his
hands
grasping
into
the
chair
arms
aw
come
on
and
love
me
honey
she
whispered
gim
me
a
little
loving
igo
crazy
livin
here
with
you
unless
you
gim
me
some
lovin
honey
sherry
stood
up
slowly
and
she
came
with
him
her
hands
clasped
tightly
at
the
back
of
his
neck
her
body
stretched
up
and
rhythmically
and
insistently
pushing
against
his
her
head
flung
back
eyes
closed
and
mouth
moist
and
open
he
looked
down
into
her
face
and
then
unhurriedly
he
reached
up
holding
to
her
wrists
and
she
began
to
tremble
her
eyes
still
closed
aw
come
on
honey
please
honey
he
let
her
go
abruptly
knocking
against
the
flimsy
card
table
so
that
all
the
little
flowers
trembled
in
the
water
glass
he
walked
across
the
room
to
the
dark
windows
and
the
falling
rain
outside
and
from
behind
him
tude
said
her
voice
high
and
sharp
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
liked
me
all
right
that
time
we
did
it
did
nt
you
sherry
did
not
answer
her
he
stood
for
a
time
and
when
he
turned
finally
his
face
was
tired
his
eyes
looked
inward
his
smile
wry
and
self
mocking
tude
was
sitting
in
the
chair
that
he
had
left
her
body
sagging
and
apathetic
now
her
elaborate
hair
do
carelessly
dropped
forward
between
her
two
supporting
hands
whatever
it
is
you
want
you
better
try
some
other
way
sherry
said
it
s
he
came
to
the
table
slowly
reaching
for
cigarettes
and
he
spoke
again
without
looking
at
her
what
were
you
really
after
anyway
you
still
bound
i
ll
take
you
to
a
doctor
is
that
it
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
and
after
a
moment
he
said
okay
kid
i
m
sick
and
tired
of
it
you
listen
to
what
i
m
gon
na
say
for
a
minute
he
hesitated
his
face
frowning
and
when
he
went
on
he
spoke
more
rapidly
his
voice
a
little
strained
you
know
what
fay
was
sick
with
and
the
way
she
died
of
it
well
fay
had
a
an
abortion
once
see
christ
they
do
nt
nobody
know
about
those
things
but
she
always
claimed
it
was
having
that
abortion
that
time
that
made
her
get
sick
the
way
she
did
that
s
what
fay
always
thought
so
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
that
s
the
story
i
had
my
head
full
of
fay
and
i
had
my
head
full
of
that
or
you
would
nt
have
that
certificate
you
got
now
that
s
the
whole
story
and
now
i
m
sick
and
tired
of
it
and
i
say
the
hell
with
it
if
you
want
it
so
bad
as
all
this
it
s
your
own
business
i

nt
been
pushing
you
around
just
for
the
fun
of
it
i

a
doc
tomorrow

what
i
m
telling
you

me
alone
tude
said
shut
up
and
leave
me
alone
he
reached
down
then
his
fingers
digging
hard
into
her
shoulder
did
you
hear
what
i
said
i
said
i
ll
take
you
to
see
a
doctor
tomorrow

can
go
to
a
doctor
and

this
i
ll
take
you
tomorrow
me
alone
why
ca
nt
you
i
do
nt
want
to
go
to
no
doctor
sherry
stood
transfixed
his
hand
falling
away
from
her
shoulder
what
you
mean
you
do
nt
want
to
go
to
a
doctor
she
looked
up
at
him
for
an
instant
her
eyes
in
the
hammock
and
half
out
of
it
andrew
tortured
a
beetle
in
the
grass
and
fretfully
murmured
obscenities
a
squirrel
sassed
him
from
the
crotch
of
the
tulip
tree
and
beth
three
feet
away
insolently
sat
with
her
back
to
him
nothing
could
make
him
feel
worse
when
he
was
feeling
bad
to
start
with
than
the
insult
of
a
cat
he
hated
them
all
and
most
of
all
he
hated
this
black
bug
whose
legs
he
slowly
amputated
between
the
dirty
words
he
talked
as
he
worked
to
an
imaginary
twin
who
sat
on
the
grass
at
the
base
of
the
tree
this
interested
and
adventitious
homunculus
although
it
was
his
twin
was
nevertheless
much
younger
than
he
and
surpassingly
ignorant
when
i
have
finished
killing
charles
i
ll
take
you
downtown
he
said
to
it
how
would
you
like
to
eatpan
alewife
at
the
smoke
house
what
is
an
alewife
why
it
s
a
sort
of
herring
okay
just
will
be
about
the
only
chance
i
ll
have
because
day
after
tomorrow
i
ll
be
too
busy
to
bother
with
you
you
mean
because
day
after
tomorrow
you
re
going
eeling
with
victor
asked
the
twin
eeling
he
exclaimed
my
god
you
do
nt
know
anything
do
you
do
you
think
i
d
catch
an
eel
on
purpose
the
poor
kid
quickly
changed
the
subject
when
will
the
funeral
be
he
asked
ten
in
the
morning
probably
replied
andrew
depending
on
the
tide
why
depending
on
the
tide
because
we
have
to
go
clamming
right
afterward
it
was
mid
morning
but
the
dew
was
not
yet
dry
in
the
shade
of
the
elms
drops
of
it
depended
like
beads
from
a
spider
web
that
was
strung
from
tree
to
tree
andrew
had
been
awake
since
daybreak
stirred
out
of
sleep
by
two
wrens
that
had
held
a
shrill
colloquy
in
the
vine
over
with
the
strong
fresh
breeze
on
his
face
he
had
seen
his
cousin
s
lamp
go
off
for
a
moment
he
was
so
thrilled
to
think
of
the
two
of
them
awake
in
the
sleeping
house
at
five
in
the
morning
that
he
had
thought
of
knocking
on
her
door
and
asking
her
to
go
for
a
swim
but
he
knew
that
the
lake
would
be
cold
and
anyhow
there
was
something
too
intimate
and
isolated
about
this
hour
of
the
day
alone
with
her
in
the
aboriginal
morning
with
nothing
else
to
distract
her
she
might
read
his
criminal
mind
she
had
not
come
down
to
the
dining
room
while
he
and
the
twins
were
eating
their
breakfast
and
her
tray
which
usually
went
up
at
half
past
seven
had
not
gone
up
by
the
time
he
left
the
house
at
nearly
nine
there
was
a
funny
feeling
in
the
house
the
maids
and
the
twins
were
quiet
and
no
one
seemed
able
to
settle
down
to
anything
it
was
always
that
way
whenever
cousin
katharine
s
routine
was
all
night
he
told
his
twin
all
night
long
she
was
reading
my
mind
maybe
she
just
turned
on
the
light
for
a
minute
suggested
the
twin
listen
he
said
to
this
impudent
doubting
thomas
listen
to
me
i
m
boss
around
here
i
said
cousin
katharine
stayed
up
all
night
and
that
s
what
she
did
no
ifs
buts
or
maybes
the
twin
blubbered
at
the
scolding
and
more
kindly
andrew
said
come
on
half
pint
charles
smithwicked
is
deader
than
a
door
nail
he
had
decided
to
go
down
to
the
village
because
of
something
harriet
had
said
the
night
before
when
they
were
playing
three
handed
bridge
she
had
said
he
should
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
behaving
like
a
baby
he
could
nt
fool
her
she
said
he
was
nt
reading
in
the
hammock
he
was
nt
doing
anything
but
pretending
it
was
a
cradle
she
thought
that
anyone
should
have
more
pride
than
to
advertise
to
the
resources
he
had
flung
down
his
cards
and
told
her
to
go
to
hell
but
she
was
right
and
he
was
ashamed
and
all
night
long
he
had
pitched
and
tossed
and
pummeled
his
pillow
and
deranged
the
bedding
it
took
great
courage
to
leave
the
hammock
and
to
expose
himself
to
the
town
his
mouth
was
as
dry
and
his
heart
was
as
erratic
as
it
always
was
when
he
had
to
be
in
any
kind
of
play
or
exhibition
it
was
like
a
dream
of
going
to
school
in
his
underwear
but
he
steeled
himself
he
got
up
full
of
determination
to
honor
who
called
out
from
the
drawing
room
to
ask
him
where
he
was
going
he
replied
i
ve
got
some
errands
to
run
downstreet
she
saved
his
life
then
for
in
fact
he
had
no
errands
at
all
but
she
asked
him
to
take
the
morning
letters
to
the
post
office
there
were
five
altogether
the
three
they
had
written
to
their
parents
andrew
having
nothing
to
say
health
of
the
animals
all
of
whom
were
well
and
two
in
cousin
katharine
s
hand
one
to
the
shipleys
and
the
other
to
aunt
alma
when
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
held
these
last
two
up
to
the
light
but
the
letter
paper
was
thick
and
he
could
not
make
out
a
word
he
would
have
given
much
to
know
what
she
had
written
about
him
he
idled
down
the
road
and
through
the
town
keeping
up
appearances
by
smiling
to
himself
and
from
time
to
time
if
he
passed
anyone
faking
a
chuckle
he
paused
to
look
at
an
unfamiliar
skiff
tied
up
at
the
small
pier
and
to
speculate
on
its
owner
and
its
purpose
and
to
deduce
that
it
had
sailed
in
from
bingham
bay
on
the
early
wind
it
occurred
to
him
to
board
it
and
get
a
lift
to
the
docks
to
hunt
for
congreve
smithwick
and
reclaim
his
knife
with
which
to
cut
out
charles
s
heart
but
until
she
was
of
no
use
any
more
then
he
would
throw
her
out
the
local
constable
would
the
knife
did
not
bother
him
he
knew
about
that
the
first
thing
he
did
when
they
stopped
in
a
private
place
between
a
stone
wall
and
a
fringe
of
cedars
was
to
jerk
the
purse
from
her
hand
and
throw
it
over
the
wall
that
took
care
of
the
knife
but
he
did
nt
know
about
himself
because
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
been
in
love
with
a
woman
he
thought
he
only
meant
to
punish
her
after
two
slashes
the
quirt
was
not
enough
he
dropped
it
on
the
ground
and
used
his
fists
his
breathing
came
out
in
squealing
whines
catherine
did
her
best
not
to
fall
into
panic
she
tried
to
duck
his
threshing
fists
or
at
least
to
make
them
ineffective
but
at
last
fear
overcame
her
and
she
tried
to
run
he
leaped
at
her
and
brought
her
down
and
by
then
his
fists
were
not
enough
his
frantic
hand
found
a
stone
on
the
ground
and
his
cold
control
was
burst
through
with
a
red
roaring
wave
he
listened
for
her
heartbeat
and
could
hear
nothing
over
the
thumping
of
his
own
two
complete
and
separate
thoughts
ran
in
his
mind
one
said
have
to
bury
her
have
to
dig
a
hole
and
put
her
in
it
and
the
other
cried
like
a
child
i
ca
nt
stand
it
could
nt
bear
to
touch
her
then
the
sickness
that
follows
rage
overwhelmed
him
he
ran
from
the
place
leaving
his
suitcase
leaving
the
quirt
leaving
the
oak
box
of
money
he
blundered
away
in
the
dusk
wondering
only
where
he
could
hide
his
sickness
for
a
while
no
question
was
ever
asked
of
him
after
a
time
of
sickness
to
which
his
wife
ministered
tenderly
he
went
back
to
his
business
and
never
again
let
the
insanity
of
love
come
near
him
a
man
who
ca
nt
east
of
eden
learn
from
experience
is
a
fool
he
said
always
afterward
he
had
a
kind
of
fearful
respect
for
himself
he
had
never
known
that
had
not
killed
catherine
was
an
accident
every
blow
had
been
intended
to
crush
her
she
was
a
long
time
unconscious
and
a
long
time
half
conscious
she
realized
her
arm
was
broken
and
that
she
must
find
help
if
she
wanted
to
live
wanting
to
live
forced
her
to
drag
herself
along
the
dark
road
looking
for
help
she
turned
in
at
a
gate
and
almost
made
the
steps
of
the
house
before
she
fainted
the
roosters
were
crowing
in
the
chickenhouse
and
a
gray
rim
of
dawn
lay
on
the
east
chapter
when
two
men
live
together
they
usually
maintain
a
kind
of
shabby
neatness
out
of
incipient
rage
at
each
other
two
men
alone
are
constantly
on
the
verge
of
fighting
and
they
know
it
adam
trask
had
not
been
home
long
before
the
tensions
began
to
build
up
the
brothers
saw
too
much
of
each
other
and
not
enough
of
anyone
else
for
a
few
months
they
were
busy
getting
cyrus
s
money
in
order
and
out
at
interest
they
traveled
together
to
washington
to
an
iron
star
with
seal
and
a
hole
on
the
top
in
which
to
insert
the
stick
for
a
little
flag
on
decoration
day
the
brothers
stood
by
the
grave
a
long
time
then
they
went
away
and
they
did
nt
mention
cyrus
if
cyrus
had
been
dishonest
he
had
done
it
well
no
one
asked
questions
about
the
money
but
the
subject
was
on
charles
mind
back
on
the
farm
adam
asked
him
why
do
nt
you
buy
some
new
clothes
you
re
a
rich
man
you
act
like
you
re
afraid
to
spend
a
penny
i
am
said
charles
why
i
might
have
to
give
it
back
still
harping
on
that
if
there
was
anything
wrong
do
nt
you
think
we
d
have
heard
about
it
by
now
i
do
nt
know
said
charles
d
rather
not
talk
about
it
but
that
night
he
brought
up
the
subject
again
there
about
the
money
yes
about
the
money
if
you
make
that
much
money
there
s
bound
to
be
a
mess
how
do
you
mean
well
papers
and
account
books
and
bills
of
sale
notes
figuring
east
of
eden
well
we
went
through
father
s
things
and
there
was
nt
none
of
that
maybe
he
burned
it
up
maybe
he
did
said
charles
the
brothers
lived
by
a
routine
established
by
charles
and
he
never
varied
it
charles
awakened
on
the
stroke
of
four
thirty
as
surely
as
though
the
brass
pendulum
of
the
clock
had
nudged
him
he
was
awake
in
fact
a
split
second
before
four
thirty
his
eyes
were
open
and
had
blinked
once
before
the
high
gong
struck
for
a
moment
he
lay
still
looking
up
into
the
darkness
and
scratching
his
stomach
then
he
reached
to
the
table
beside
his
bed
and
his
hand
fell
exactly
on
the
block
of
sulphur
matches
lying
there
on
the
side
of
the
block
the
sulphur
burned
its
little
blue
bead
before
the
wood
caught
charles
lighted
the
candle
beside
his
bed
he
threw
back
his
blanket
and
got
up
he
wore
long
gray
underwear
that
bagged
over
his
knees
and
hung
loose
around
his
ankles
yawning
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
called
half
past
four
adam
time
to
get
up
wake
up
adam
s
voice
was
muffled
do
nt
you
ever
forget
it
s
time
to
get
up
charles
slipped
his
legs
into
his
pants
and
hunched
them
up
over
his
hips
you
do
nt
have
to
get
up
he
said
you
re
a
rich
man
you
can
lay
in
bed
all
day
so
are
you
but
we
still
get
up
before
daylight
you
do
nt
have
to
get
up
charles
repeated
but
if
you
re
going
to
farm
you
d
better
farm
buy
the
gun
in
his
hand
i
took
a
few
steps
forward
walking
blindly
now
unthinking
yet
my
mind
registering
it
all
vividly
across
and
starting
up
on
the
curb
and
seeing
clifton
up
closer
now
lying
in
the
same
position
on
his
side
a
huge
wetness
growing
on
his
shirt
and
i
could
nt
set
my
foot
down
cars
sailed
step
that
would
raise
me
up
to
the
walk
i
stood
there
one
leg
in
the
street
and
the
other
raised
above
the
curb
hearing
whistles
screeching
and
looked
toward
the
library
to
see
two
cops
coming
on
in
a
lunging
big
bellied
run
i
looked
back
to
clifton
the
cop
was
waving
me
away
with
his
gun
sounding
like
a
boy
with
a
changing
voice
get
back
on
the
other
side
he
said
he
was
the
cop
that
i
d
passed
on
forty
third
a
few
minutes
before
my
mouth
was
dry
he
s
a
friend
of
mine
i
want
to
help
i
said
finally
stepping
upon
the
curb
he
do
nt
need
no
help
junior
get
across
that
street
the
cop
s
hair
hung
on
the
sides
of
his
face
his
uniform
was
dirty
and
i
watched
him
without
emotion
hesitated
hearing
the
sound
of
footfalls
approaching
everything
seemed
slowed
down
a
pool
formed
slowly
on
the
walk
the
cop
looked
at
me
curiously
above
in
the
park
i
could
hear
the
furious
flapping
of
wings
on
my
neck
the
pressure
of
eyes
i
turned
a
round
headed
apple
cheeked
boy
with
thickly
freckled
nose
and
slavic
eyes
leaned
over
the
fence
of
the
park
above
and
now
as
he
saw
me
turn
he
shrilled
something
to
someone
behind
him
his
fact
lighting
up
with
ecstasy
what
does
it
mean
i
wondered
turning
back
to
that
to
which
i
did
not
wish
to
turn
there
were
three
cops
now
one
watching
the
crowd
and
the
others
looking
at
clifton
the
first
cop
had
his
cap
on
again
look
junior
he
said
very
clearly
i
had
enough
trouble
for
today
you
going
to
get
on
across
that
street
i
opened
my
mouth
but
nothing
would
come
kneeling
one
of
the
cops
was
examining
clifton
and
making
notes
on
a
pad
i
m
his
friend
i
said
and
a
cooked
pigeon
mac
he
said
you
ai
nt
got
any
friend
any
more
i
looked
at
him
hey
mickey
the
boy
above
us
called
the
guy
s
out
cold
i
looked
down
that
s
right
the
kneeling
cop
said
what
s
your
name
i
told
him
i
answered
his
questions
about
clifton
as
best
i
could
until
the
wagon
came
for
once
it
came
quickly
i
watched
numbly
as
they
moved
him
inside
placing
the
box
of
dolls
in
with
him
across
the
street
the
crowd
still
churned
then
the
wagon
was
gone
and
i
started
back
toward
the
subway
say
mister
the
boy
s
voice
shrilled
down
your
friend
sure
knows
how
to
use
his
dukes
biff
bang
one
two
and
the
cop
s
on
his
ass
i
bowed
my
head
to
this
final
tribute
and
now
walking
away
in
the
sun
i
tried
down
the
subway
stairs
seeing
nothing
my
mind
plunging
the
subway
was
cool
and
i
leaned
against
a
pillar
hearing
the
roar
of
trains
passing
across
on
the
other
side
feeling
the
rushing
roar
of
air
why
should
a
man
deliberately
plunge
outside
of
history
and
peddle
an
obscenity
my
mind
went
on
abstractedly
why
should
he
choose
to
disarm
himself
give
up
his
voice
and
leave
the
only
organization
offering
him
a
chance
to
define
himself
the
platform
vibrated
and
i
looked
down
bits
of
paper
whirled
up
in
the
passage
of
air
settling
quickly
as
a
train
moved
past
why
had
he
turned
away
why
had
he
chosen
to
step
off
the
platform
and
fall
beneath
the
train
why
did
he
choose
to
plunge
into
nothingness
into
the
void
of
faceless
faces
of
soundless
voices
lying
outside
history
i
tried
to
step
away
and
look
at
it
from
a
distance
of
words
read
in
books
half
remembered
for
history
records
the
patterns
of
men
s
lives
results
who
fought
and
who
won
and
who
lived
to
lie
about
it
afterwards
all
things
it
is
said
are
duly
recorded
all
things
of
importance
that
is
but
not
quite
for
actually
it
is
only
the
known
the
seen
the
heard
and
only
those
events
that
the
recorder
regards
as
important
that
are
put
down
those
lies
his
keepers
keep
their
power
by
but
the
cop
would
be
clifton
s
historian
his
judge
his
witness
and
his
executioner
and
i
was
the
only
brother
in
the
watching
crowd
and
i
the
only
witness
for
the
defense
knew
neither
the
extent
of
his
guilt
nor
the
nature
of
his
crime
where
were
the
historians
today
and
how
would
they
put
it
down
i
stood
there
with
the
trains
plunging
in
and
out
throwing
blue
sparks
what
did
they
ever
think
of
us
transitory
ones
ones
such
as
i
had
been
before
i
found
brotherhood
birds
of
passage
who
were
too
obscure
for
learned
classification
of
natures
too
ambiguous
for
the
most
ambiguous
words
and
too
distant
from
the
centers
of
historical
decision
to
sign
or
even
to
applaud
the
signers
of
historical
documents
we
who
write
no
novels
histories
or
other
books
what
about
us
i
thought
seeing
clifton
again
in
my
mind
and
going
to
sit
upon
a
bench
as
a
cool
gust
of
air
rolled
up
the
tunnel
a
body
of
people
came
down
the
platform
some
of
them
negroes
yes
i
thought
what
about
those
of
us
who
shoot
up
from
the
south
into
the
busy
city
like
wild
jacks
in
the
box
broken
loose
from
our
springs
so
sudden
that
our
gait
becomes
like
that
of
deep
sea
divers
suffering
from
the
bends
what
about
those
fellows
waiting
still
and
silent
there
on
the
platform
so
still
and
silent
that
they
clash
with
the
friends
let
s
have
a
festival
of
talk
you
start
cress
cress
asked
a
question
she
had
been
wanting
to
ask
for
a
long
time
tell
us
about
that
the
picture
a
large
one
in
a
narrow
gilt
frame
hung
on
the
wall
just
above
the
keyboard
of
the
piano
so
that
cress
when
she
practiced
often
looked
at
it
the
picture
was
of
mrs
charlesbois
as
a
girl
she
wore
a
purple
the
picture
was
hand
tinted
velvet
dress
with
a
train
and
there
waspwhite
fur
ermine
cress
believed
around
the
neck
and
the
edges
of
the
great
bell
shaped
sleeves
on
her
head
she
wore
her
hair
long
even
then
was
a
golden
tiara
just
large
enough
to
encircle
the
mound
of
her
up
piled
hair
was
that
cress
asked
the
dress
for
your
coming
out
party
coming
out
party
oh
cress
mrs
charlesbois
laugh
was
like
her
hair
and
skin
warm
a
mingling
of
rosiness
and
darkness
her
voice
laughed
at
the
funniness
of
that
suggestion
but
it
cried
too
at
something
sorrowful
in
it
she
left
the
fireplace
and
took
the
picture
off
the
it
as
if
it
were
a
mirror
coming
out
party
sweet
little
cressy
what
would
i
have
come
out
of
or
to
she
carried
the
picture
over
to
mr
rivers
and
cress
was
the
audience
now
as
mrs
charlesbois
one
hand
on
the
back
of
mr
rivers
chair
addressed
her
talk
to
him
were
you
ever
in
oilinda
she
asked
a
little
oil
town
up
in
the
stubble
hills
the
houses
throbbing
all
night
with
the
pumps
and
the
coyotes
coming
down
at
dawn
to
steal
the
kids
pet
rabbits
mr
rivers
looked
up
from
the
picture
saying
no
by
a
shake
of
his
head
you
ve
missed
nothing
mrs
charlesbois
declared
i
was
born
there
i
think
maybe
i
m
the
only
baby
who
ever
was
most
pregnant
women
could
nt
stand
the
smell
of
the
oil
and
the
constant
throb
of
the
pumps
and
the
buzzards
and
snakes
anyway
i
was
born
there
and
went
to
school
there
and
was
the
picture
of
me
queen
of
the
orange
county
fair
they
could
nt
possibly
have
elected
anyone
else
they
could
have
but
they
did
nt
fifteen
or
twenty
other
girls
were
candidates
but
i
won
easily
oil
men
make
big
money
or
did
then
and
they
are
easy
spenders
you
voted
she
explained
by
buying
tickets
at
a
quarter
each
one
man
a
driller
bought
an
even
hundred
so
i
won
i
reigned
for
the
five
days
of
the
fair
rode
around
the
county
sitting
on
the
back
of
a
convertible
and
accompanied
by
a
five
piece
band
such
crazy
nonsense
on
the
second
night
of
the
fair
i
was
formally
inaugurated
floodlights
a
full
band
then
and
so
forth
they
gave
me
this
ring
that
night
it
was
my
prize
for
winning
the
election
she
held
up
her
left
hand
and
showed
them
the
diamond
she
wore
above
her
wedding
ring
it
is
small
but
deep
and
true
in
color
then
looking
over
mr
rivers
shoulder
and
speaking
objectively
she
was
really
quite
a
pretty
girl
then
there
was
a
small
silence
before
mr
rivers
as
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
however
awkward
or
difficult
said
she
was
beautiful
inez
she
still
is
it
was
the
first
time
cress
had
ever
heard
mrs
charlesbois
called
by
her
first
name
she
looked
at
her
as
if
beneath
the
familiar
outline
she
might
see
emerging
a
new
and
more
intimate
personage
and
for
a
minute
that
hidden
person
did
partially
emerge
that
sweet
regal
newly
crowned
girl
was
there
in
the
room
more
real
than
the
grown
up
music
teacher
oh
mr
rivers
she
said
thanks
thanks
i
was
seventeen
then
and
that
was
seventeen
years
ago
why
i
m
old
enough
to
be
cress
s
mother
easily
old
enough
at
first
cress
thought
proudly
that
mrs
charlesbois
was
do
nt
i
have
a
daughter
like
cress
but
she
was
nt
sure
because
the
next
words
she
said
were
me
me
inez
dresden
she
took
the
picture
from
mr
rivers
and
went
to
the
window
with
it
and
gazed
into
the
picture
rather
than
at
it
since
that
was
the
darkest
spot
in
the
room
i
was
the
first
queen
they
had
ever
had
who
could
do
anything
except
pose
in
a
bathing
suit
or
ride
on
a
rolled
back
convertible
top
when
they
found
i
could
play
the
piano
they
had
me
play
every
night
in
the
intermission
between
band
pieces
cress
said
oh
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
you
and
heard
you
i
was
just
about
as
good
then
as
i
am
now
i
m
afraid
afraid
cress
said
one
should
grow
develop
geniuses
cress
said
fiercely
ca
nt
improve
like
other
people
can
they
they
once
again
cress
had
the
feeling
that
the
young
queen
was
there
in
the
room
but
mrs
charlesbois
the
music
teacher
came
back
and
chided
her
do
nt
be
silly
cress
nevertheless
she
ran
her
finger
over
the
glass
of
the
picture
as
if
hunting
for
that
lost
fur
and
velvet
and
diadem
i
met
luther
the
last
night
of
the
fair
she
said
luther
cress
repeated
mr
charlesbois
he
came
up
onto
the
grandstand
and
played
a
duet
with
me
he
d
had
about
one
bottle
of
beer
too
much
and
someone
had
dared
him
to
do
it
we
played
beethoven
s
appassionata
together
mr
rivers
who
knew
about
serious
music
said
the
appassionata
cress
said
i
did
nt
know
mr
charlesbois
played
i
did
nt
know
he
even
liked
music
i
do
nt
think
he
does
any
more
mrs
charlesbois
replied
taking
the
picture
back
to
its
place
on
the
charlesboises
at
ten
thirty
mrs
charlesbois
asked
is
there
really
any
sense
in
your
going
home
at
this
hour
cress
why
do
nt
i
just
call
your
mother
and
tell
her
you
re
spending
the
night
here
there
s
except
his
envious
although
not
grudging
imagination
backed
by
such
slight
apparent
proof
as
that
she
came
into
my
room
in
her
petticoat
this
was
only
because
we
lived
on
the
same
floor
she
went
into
kayo
obermark
s
the
same
way
we
had
the
attic
between
the
three
of
us
it
just
was
proximity
even
if
provocation
was
never
far
away
it
came
simply
from
unremitting
practice
like
that
of
the
fiddler
who
has
a
rubber
ball
in
the
pocket
of
his
and
is
never
far
from
for
him
the
greatest
thing
along
the
accidentals
and
slides
of
landscape
and
steel
rail
no
she
came
to
borrow
a
cigarette
or
to
use
the
closet
where
she
kept
the
overflow
of
her
dresses
or
to
talk
we
now
had
something
more
to
talk
about
for
by
and
by
we
found
we
had
another
connection
it
was
through
that
swarthy
sylvester
for
whom
i
used
to
pass
out
movie
handbills
and
who
had
tried
to
make
a
communist
of
simon
he
had
never
finished
his
degree
at
armour
tech
he
said
it
was
from
lack
of
dough
and
hinted
also
his
political
assignment
elsewhere
but
it
was
everybody
s
thought
that
he
had
washed
out
be
that
as
it
might
he
was
living
in
new
york
and
working
for
the
subway
at
a
technical
job
under
forty
second
street
he
seemed
bound
to
have
occupations
in
the
darkness
and
by
now
this
had
laid
a
peculiar
coloring
on
him
his
face
darkened
sallow
and
slack
cheeked
and
his
eyes
injured
the
skin
by
the
continual
effort
and
wrinkling
his
eyes
probably
at
the
ruby
and
green
cut
buttons
of
his
burrow
office
there
where
he
sat
at
a
drawing
board
and
copied
blueprints
and
read
pamphlets
in
his
leisure
time
he
had
been
expelled
like
frazer
from
the
communist
party
on
charges
of
infantile
leftism
and
trotskyist
deviationism
the
terms
were
queer
to
me
and
just
as
queer
was
his
assuming
that
i
understood
them
he
belonged
to
another
party
now
the
trotskyites
and
was
still
a
bolshevik
and
disclosed
that
he
was
never
free
from
duty
never
unassigned
never
went
anywhere
without
permission
from
party
chiefs
even
returning
to
chicago
ostensibly
to
visit
his
father
the
old
man
called
by
grandma
the
baker
he
had
a
mission
which
was
to
contact
frazer
so
i
inferred
that
frazer
was
being
recruited
to
the
new
party
i
happened
to
walk
behind
them
on
fifty
seventh
street
one
day
sylvester
was
toting
a
fat
briefcase
and
looking
up
at
frazer
accent
while
frazer
was
looking
past
and
over
him
with
aloof
gravity
and
had
his
hands
clasped
at
his
back
i
also
saw
sylvester
on
the
stairs
of
the
rooming
house
with
mimi
he
was
or
had
been
mimi
s
brother
in
law
married
in
new
york
to
her
sister
annie
who
had
now
left
him
and
was
getting
a
divorce
i
recalled
how
his
first
wife
threw
stones
at
him
when
he
tried
to
come
through
her
father
s
backyard
to
talk
to
her
and
i
even
remembered
the
surroundings
in
which
i
had
heard
about
this
from
him
the
grim
air
of
cold
milwaukee
avenue
when
we
peddled
razorblades
and
glasscutters
with
jimmy
klein
sylvester
wanted
mimi
to
plead
with
her
sister
for
him
hell
mimi
told
me
as
much
for
my
private
ear
as
any
of
her
opinions
were
if
i
had
known
him
before
they
were
married
i
would
have
told
annie
not
to
do
it
he
leaks
misery
all
over
i
wonder
how
she
could
stand
two
full
years
of
you
imagine
being
in
bed
with
him
and
that
mud
face
and
those
lips
why
he
looks
like
the
frog
prince
i
hope
now
she
ll
get
under
the
sheets
with
a
young
strong
stevedore
if
somebody
fell
against
mimi
s
lines
she
had
no
mercy
and
as
she
listened
to
sylvester
she
kept
in
mind
her
sister
bolt
upright
in
a
huskier
man
s
clasp
and
struggling
her
arms
with
pleasure
and
it
made
me
for
a
minute
dislike
her
for
her
cruelty
that
she
held
her
eyes
open
for
sylvester
so
that
he
might
look
in
and
see
this
what
was
to
make
it
an
acceptable
joke
was
the
supposition
that
he
could
nt
see
no
he
probably
could
nt
it
needs
to
be
explained
that
in
mimi
s
hard
view
all
that
you
inherited
from
the
mixing
peoples
of
the
past
and
the
chance
of
parents
encountering
like
texas
cattle
was
your
earthy
material
which
it
was
your
own
job
to
make
into
admirable
flesh
in
other
words
applied
to
sylvester
he
was
in
large
was
a
bad
kiln
and
also
it
was
his
fault
that
he
could
nt
keep
his
wives
and
girls
i
hear
his
first
one
was
a
dizzy
bitch
and
annie
has
something
of
a
slut
about
her
too
what
makes
them
go
for
him
at
the
start
that
really
interests
me
said
mimi
and
she
supposed
that
they
must
take
his
little
gloom
for
real
devilishness
and
expect
him
to
visit
their
places
with
prickles
and
fire
like
a
genuine
demon
when
he
failed
to
turning
out
to
be
mere
uncompleted
mud
they
threw
stones
at
him
real
or
figurative
she
was
savage
minded
mimi
and
prized
her
savagery
as
proof
that
there
was
no
monkey
business
about
her
she
punished
and
took
blows
as
the
real
thing
that
humiliated
bandy
legged
weak
haired
and
too
long
however
the
subterranean
draftsman
and
comedy
commissar
of
a
soviet
america
to
be
teaching
himself
the
manner
and
even
the
winner
s
smile
and
confidence
why
he
was
going
to
blast
off
the
old
fresh
humanity
he
tried
to
impress
me
with
the
command
he
had
over
marxian
coal
and
cotton
plenary
dates
factional
history
texts
of
lenin
and
plekhanov
what
he
had
really
was
the
long
distance
dreaming
gaze
of
the
eyes
into
the
future
and
the
pick
of
phrase
which
he
a
bench
and
gazed
at
notre
dame
till
almost
dawn
how
quiet
the
city
is
a
lonely
shabby
man
is
pushing
a
handcart
through
the
city
streets
lines
space
harmony
softened
by
dark
mists
dusk
of
dawn
kissing
the
pavements
with
tenderness
i
doubt
if
gil
would
understand
feelings
like
these
yet
they
mean
so
much
to
me
to
my
heart
mine
is
the
glory
of
those
angels
against
the
background
of
that
pearly
infinite
sky
june
thi
m
so
this
my
honeymoon
is
it
possible
that
gil
has
betrayed
me
so
cruelly
so
cynically
for
days
now
i
ve
pretended
to
be
ill
to
avoid
having
it
out
with
him
but
in
the
end
i
must
do
it
it
all
began
that
afternoon
when
i
went
to
see
a
loft
bank
art
exhibit
i
stayed
behind
and
got
to
talking
to
some
of
the
younger
artists
both
american
and
french
all
of
whom
were
complete
strangers
to
me
one
young
man
an
american
expatriate
obviously
a
trotskyite
began
a
violent
tirade
against
the
party
charging
that
membership
in
the
party
was
death
to
artists
i
told
him
that
i
was
a
painter
and
did
not
think
so
he
then
told
me
not
to
be
naive
like
that
eva
blount
who
had
had
such
a
stunningly
successful
exhibit
in
new
york
last
spring
he
did
nt
know
who
i
was
and
i
asked
him
what
was
so
naive
about
eva
blount
he
said
that
it
was
common
knowledge
in
radical
circles
that
gil
blount
had
the
party
for
prestige
purposes
he
went
on
talking
of
other
instances
where
such
had
happened
i
was
silent
i
felt
cold
dead
to
stand
in
a
crowd
of
people
and
hear
them
talk
of
you
like
that
i
asked
him
how
he
knew
this
and
what
right
he
had
to
spread
such
foul
gossip
about
people
he
did
not
know
he
then
went
on
to
tell
things
which
only
someone
close
to
the
revolutionary
movement
could
know
he
said
that
gil
s
secretary
rose
lampkin
was
his
mistress
and
had
been
for
years
and
that
at
the
same
time
she
was
spying
on
gil
i
could
not
contradict
him
to
hear
one
s
private
life
spoken
about
so
brutally
in
public
god
it
ca
nt
be
true
yet
his
words
explain
so
much
is
that
why
gil
is
away
from
home
so
much
is
that
why
he
never
comes
to
me
except
when
he
s
drunk
oh
god
i
feel
i
ve
no
ground
under
this
and
that
rose
lampkin
woman
gil
s
secretary
is
she
his
mistress
is
that
why
he
insisted
that
she
accompany
us
to
paris
the
more
i
think
the
sicker
i
get
i
try
to
tell
myself
that
this
can
not
be
true
yet
in
my
heart
i
know
it
and
feel
it
june
has
all
but
said
that
it
s
true
which
means
that
when
i
confronted
him
he
would
not
say
anything
he
raves
at
me
telling
me
that
i
m
trying
to
undermine
his
party
position
that
i
m
slandering
him
i
asked
him
to
send
rose
back
to
new
york
and
he
said
that
it
was
the
party
s
decision
that
rose
remain
with
him
and
rose
when
she
came
to
the
hotel
this
morning
had
a
cold
smirk
on
her
face
she
knows
that
i
know
according
to
gil
i
must
accept
this
betrayal
and
be
loyal
to
the
party
to
be
loyal
to
my
feelings
means
betraying
the
party
feel
that
everybody
s
laughing
at
me
that
everybody
knowsi
could
kill
gil
i
must
be
calm
i
ve
only
my
work
left
that
s
all
i
tell
myself
all
day
long
that
i
must
give
my
life
to
my
work
if
i
make
a
sudden
hysterical
move
i
ll
lose
my
grip
on
myself
gil
has
predicted
as
much
can
there
be
betrayals
as
intimately
cynical
as
this
i
m
a
fool
to
wonder
for
it
is
true
it
stares
me
in
the
face
but
i
do
nt
want
to
believe
it
that
s
what
makes
it
possible
no
one
wants
to
believe
it
what
coldness
people
are
capable
of
i
walk
the
streets
all
day
to
keep
thoughts
of
suicide
from
filling
my
head
june
th
my
whole
life
seems
tainted
unclean
i
ve
asked
gill
to
take
me
back
to
new
york
he
says
he
will
as
soon
as
his
duties
with
the
french
party
are
over
i
begged
him
to
give
me
the
fare
and
he
says
was
in
the
orphans
home
i
did
nt
lose
heart
then
and
i
must
nt
now
i
wo
nt
i
ca
nt
give
up
i
must
work
work
work
paint
but
can
i
paint
again
gil
warned
me
that
i
must
not
talk
of
this
he
demanded
to
know
who
told
me
about
the
party
deciding
that
he
was
to
marry
me
he
accuses
me
of
having
anti
party
friends
i
m
afraid
if
i
stay
with
gil
i
ll
loathe
myself
if
i
run
off
the
party
will
attack
me
publicly
branding
me
a
renegade
all
of
my
friends
are
party
people
and
they
would
no
longer
speak
to
me
night
and
day
gil
demands
that
i
be
loyal
to
the
party
but
i
owe
myself
some
loyalty
too
how
can
i
face
myself
in
the
years
to
come
knowing
that
i
have
been
bought
and
in
such
a
shameful
way
gil
says
that
my
personal
feelings
do
not
count
does
nt
he
know
he
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
i
stand
before
my
easel
and
can
not
paint
i
m
numb
my
love
of
work
is
gone
when
gil
comes
into
the
hotel
room
i
begin
to
tremble
with
shame
and
rage
and
he
tells
me
that
i
must
not
can
not
talk
to
anybody
if
i
protest
the
party
will
destroy
me
last
night
he
relented
a
tiny
bit
and
said
that
i
could
be
free
only
if
i
and
i
felt
the
waning
convulsions
of
her
terror
better
that
i
tear
out
my
own
heart
and
hurl
it
to
the
passion
of
quemadero
than
that
i
should
pain
the
heart
of
my
beloved
she
looked
up
at
me
searching
my
face
and
the
panic
was
gone
from
her
eyes
and
they
were
pleading
say
you
this
she
implored
this
i
say
then
swear
i
swear
like
a
frightened
bird
with
a
broken
wing
she
darted
into
the
big
room
and
snatched
the
poniard
and
sheath
from
the
wall
and
raised
the
hilt
to
my
lips
by
this
you
swear
this
the
cross
by
this
i
swear
its
admonition
trust
god
and
hammer
on
she
thrust
it
into
my
hand
and
rested
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
close
to
my
ear
and
whispered
then
wear
it
rodrigo
of
triana
that
the
cross
of
your
faith
and
the
steel
of
your
honor
may
remind
you
forever
of
your
vow
and
now
i
was
as
guilty
as
she
and
must
share
her
guilt
for
the
secret
of
heresy
was
as
heinous
as
its
practice
and
the
inquisition
tolerated
no
distinction
between
information
concealed
and
apostasy
done
her
lips
touched
my
ear
in
a
caress
of
dew
and
she
abandoned
herself
to
my
arms
suddenly
whimpering
and
crushing
my
mouth
and
biting
my
cheeks
and
neck
in
frenzied
bliss
the
manliness
of
my
breed
scorned
place
and
time
and
i
imprisoned
her
in
my
embrace
and
looked
from
her
to
the
couch
and
she
felt
my
resolve
and
slipped
from
the
bonds
of
my
rapture
you
must
depart
she
opened
the
door
and
the
rain
misted
her
hair
in
glorious
adornment
belly
i
must
attend
my
father
rodrigo
farewell
she
encouraged
me
through
the
doorway
gently
pushing
and
closed
the
portal
and
i
stumbled
down
the
passageway
to
the
street
of
felicity
and
the
rain
smarted
my
cheeks
where
her
frantic
nails
had
ripped
my
flesh
before
she
kissed
away
the
pain
my
first
thought
was
of
my
father
to
protect
him
from
any
knowledge
that
his
associate
was
a
judaizing
converso
and
i
concocted
a
story
that
harana
had
not
answered
my
knock
and
that
i
had
taken
refuge
from
the
storm
and
had
fallen
on
the
cobblestones
in
my
haste
to
return
woe
the
lies
of
youth
flow
foolish
the
conspiracies
of
heart
and
tongue
my
father
was
waiting
for
me
at
his
desk
and
one
glance
dissipated
my
intent
for
deception
the
haggard
lines
of
his
face
and
the
indictment
of
his
eyes
besides
the
poniard
was
at
my
hip
and
how
could
i
pretend
i
had
not
entered
the
harana
home
he
motioned
me
to
the
bench
and
glanced
quickly
toward
the
us
and
mudarra
some
of
the
dread
that
i
had
first
noticed
on
my
father
s
countenance
began
to
disappear
and
he
said
impassively
now
you
know
i
did
not
reply
i
could
not
this
i
would
have
spared
you
my
son
and
the
sin
is
mine
yours
the
poignancy
of
my
question
touched
him
and
his
visage
changed
to
infinite
tenderness
aye
mine
he
nodded
the
verdict
i
have
known
all
along
that
the
haranas
are
christians
by
day
and
jews
by
night
but
i
needed
luis
and
luis
needed
me
and
it
might
have
worked
had
not
the
heart
of
my
son
and
the
heart
of
his
daughter
become
entwined
in
the
mystery
of
youth
s
first
love
i
should
not
have
gone
there
tonight
i
sought
solace
for
him
in
my
own
condemnation
the
ledger
was
not
here
i
opened
your
desk
he
got
up
and
stood
tall
before
me
he
an
andalusian
and
the
rodrigo
at
the
bridgeless
chasm
you
have
crossed
i
should
have
been
here
to
forbid
your
impetuosity
this
day
is
the
feast
of
purim
when
jews
commemorate
their
deliverance
from
haman
and
the
fealty
of
esther
and
the
guile
of
their
vengeance
on
their
enemies
i
stood
too
and
my
head
was
as
high
as
his
and
my
shoulders
as
broad
i
have
sealed
my
lips
the
poniard
was
in
my
hand
and
i
held
it
before
him
by
this
cross
i
have
sworn
reckless
warrant
of
love
s
duress
he
flung
up
his
arms
in
a
gesture
of
exasperation
now
you
have
the
stain
of
their
guilt
even
as
i
he
took
the
poniard
and
its
sheath
and
put
them
in
his
desk
and
looked
hard
at
me
again
and
there
was
a
glint
of
pride
in
his
eyes
but
by
the
sky
gods
of
your
gothic
forebears
a
man
is
born
a
man
he
clasped
his
hand
on
eyes
of
your
tutor
of
your
own
confessor
are
mirrors
for
the
inquisition
i
nodded
toward
the
back
room
and
asked
and
what
of
mudarra
mudarra
has
no
tongue
for
ouemadero
s
ears
now
to
your
monastery
and
we
will
choose
our
course
on
the
morrow
begone
in
haste
rash
youth
before
the
tempest
of
my
apprehension
rises
to
the
tempest
of
this
night
that
bedevils
us
i
ran
all
the
way
to
the
monastery
panting
and
stumbling
when
i
reached
the
door
and
it
was
closed
vespers
had
passed
and
the
cloisters
were
still
and
i
pounded
on
the
door
and
juan
ruiz
de
medina
clattered
free
the
bolt
and
let
me
in
straightway
i
went
to
my
quarters
pretending
petulance
and
disgust
and
straightway
he
came
to
me
and
put
his
candle
on
my
bench
and
studied
me
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
revealing
flame
then
he
spake
you
were
delayed
by
the
storm
perhaps
it
was
most
violent
yes
scratches
were
tender
and
very
dark
the
streets
are
slippery
and
the
rose
thorns
sharp
along
the
way
let
him
think
what
he
would
that
i
had
been
brawling
or
whoring
he
reached
for
the
candle
and
the
yellow
light
was
in
his
yellow
eyes
you
will
fast
tomorrow
and
remain
in
your
quarters
all
of
next
week
even
friday
yes
my
fray
he
was
only
half
a
dozen
blocks
down
the
line
but
dr
varley
was
away
to
hell
and
gone
in
the
altadena
hills
a
long
hot
boring
drive
yes
or
no
the
final
answer
was
yes
for
three
good
reasons
one
was
that
you
can
never
know
too
much
about
the
shadow
line
and
the
people
who
walk
it
file
peters
had
got
out
for
me
was
just
that
much
thanks
and
goodwill
the
third
reason
was
that
i
did
nt
have
anything
else
to
do
i
paid
my
check
left
my
car
where
it
was
and
walked
the
north
side
of
the
street
to
the
stockwell
building
it
was
an
antique
with
a
cigar
counter
in
the
entrance
and
a
manually
operated
elevator
that
lurched
and
hated
to
level
off
the
corridor
of
the
sixth
floor
was
narrow
and
the
doors
had
frosted
glass
panels
it
was
older
and
much
dirtier
than
my
own
building
it
was
loaded
with
doctors
dentists
christian
science
practitioners
not
doing
too
good
the
kind
of
lawyers
you
hope
the
other
fellow
has
the
kind
of
doctors
and
dentists
who
just
scrape
along
not
too
skillful
not
too
clean
not
too
much
on
the
ball
three
dollars
and
please
pay
the
nurse
tired
discouraged
men
who
know
just
exactly
where
they
stand
what
kind
of
patients
they
can
get

how
much
money

few
guys
making

money
but
they
do

look

they
fit
into
the
shabby
back
ground
which
is
protective
coloring

medicine
in
which
the
treatment
can
be
frequent
and
the
regular
use
of
local
anesthetics
is
normal
dr
which
there
were
a
dozen
people
all
uncomfortable
they
looked
like
anybody
else
they
had
no
signs
on
them
anyway
you
ca
nt
tell
a
doper
well
under
control
from
a
vegetarian
book
keeper
i
had
to
wait
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
patients
went
in
through
two
doors
an
active
ear
nose
and
throat
man
can
handle
four
sufferers
at
once
if
he
has
enough
room
finally
i
got
in
i
got
to
sit
in
a
brown
leather
chair
beside
a
table
covered
with
a
white
towel
on
which
was
a
set
of
tools
a
sterilizing
cabinet
bubbled
against
the
wall
dr
vukanich
came
in
briskly
with
his
white
smock
and
his
round
mirror
strapped
to
his
forehead
he
sat
down
in
front
of
me
on
a
stool
a
sinus
headache
is
it
very
severe
he
looked
at
a
folder
the
nurse
had
given
him
i
said
it
was
awful
blinding
especially
when
i
first
got
up
in
the
morning
he
nodded
sagely
cap
over
a
thing
that
looked
like
a
fountain
pen
he
pushed
it
into
my
mouth
close
the
lips
but
not
the
teeth
please
while
he
said
it
he
reached
out
and
switched
off
the
light
there
was
no
window
a
ventilating
fan
purred
somewhere
dr
vukanich
withdrew
his
glass
tube
and
put
the
lights
back
up
he
looked
at
me
carefully
no
congestion
at
all
mr
marlowe
if
you
have
a
headache
it
is
not
from
a
sinus
condition
i
d
hazard
a
guess
that
you
never
had
sinus
trouble
in
your
lift
you
had
a
septum
operation
some
time
in
the
past
i
see
yes
doctor
got
a
kick
playing
football
he
nodded
there
is
a
slight
shelf
of
bone
which
should
have
been
cut
away
hardly
enough
to
interfere
with
breathing
how
ever
he
leaned
back
on
the
stool
and
held
his
knee
just
what
did
with
an
uninteresting
pallor
he
looked
like
a
tubercular
he
asked
he
was
a
thin
faced
man
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
a
friend
of
mine
he
s
in
bad
shape
he
s
a
writer
plenty
of
dough
but
bad
nerves
needs
help
he
lives
on
the
sauce
for
days
on
end
he
needs
that
little
extra
something
his
own
doctor
wo
nt
co
operate
any
more
exactly
what
do
you
mean
by
co
operate
dr
vukanich
asked
all
the
guy
needs
is
an
occasional
shot
to
calm
him
down
i
thought
maybe
we
could
work
something
out
the
money
would
be
solid
sorry
mr
marlowe
it
is
not
my
sort
of
problem
he
stood
up
rather
a
crude
approach
if
i
may
say
so
your
friend
may
consult
me
if
he
chooses
but
he
d
better
have
something
wrong
with
him
that
requires
treatment
that
will
be
ten
dollars
mr
marlowe
come
off
it
doc
you
re
on
the
list
at
it
i
gave
him
dr
vukanich
leaned
against
the
wall
and
lit
a
cigarette
he
was
one
of
my
cards
to
look
at
instead
he
looked
at
it
what
list
would
that
be
he
inquired
the
barred
window
boys
i
figure
you
might
know
my
friend
already
his
name
s
wade
i
figure
you
might
have
him
stashed
away
somewhere
in
a
little
white
room
the
guy
is
missing
from
home
you
are
an
ass
dr
vukanich
told
me
i
do
nt
go
in
for
penny
ante
stuff
like
four
day
liquor
cures
they
cure
nothing
in
any
case
i
have
no
little
white
rooms
and
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
friend
you
mention
even
if
he
exists
that
will
be
ten
dollars
cash
right
now
or
that
he
hide
katherine
away
in
one
of
the
northern
castles
and
of
his
indignant
repudiation
of
the
idea
adding
with
tenderness
it
seems
joan
has
forgot
what
love
is
sweet
heart
or
she
could
nt
suggest
such
a
thing
in
fact
joan
s
intervention
had
but
increased
his
ardor
and
far
from
hiding
katherine
during
these
three
and
a
half
years
he
had
taken
her
with
him
on
all
his
journeys
throughout
england
the
constables
of
his
yorkshire
castles
pickering
knaresborough
and
the
gloomy
pontefract
of
the
high
peak
in
derbyshire
of
newcastle
under
lyme
and
tutbury
in
staffordshire
as
well
as
of
kenilworth
and
leicester
had
grown
accustomed
to
receiving
lady
swynford
in
the
duchess
s
place
nor
during
that
time
did
these
constables
ever
see
the
castilian
duchess
she
remained
at
hertford
in
retirement
rumor
said
that
she
was
sickly
a
little
crazed
which
could
not
be
said
of
lady
swynford
there
were
four
beaufort
bastards
now
the
last
a
year
old
girl
christened
joan
for
her
father
the
duke
appeared
to
dote
on
all
these
babes
as
wholeheartedly
as
though
they
had
been
fair
born
the
three
little
beaufort
boys
john
harry
and
thomas
squatted
now
on
stools
by
their
parents
knees
gaping
at
the
antics
of
their
elders
while
the
duke
caressed
the
curly
yellow
head
of
his
namesake
and
asked
katherine
some
laughing
question
with
all
the
fond
domesticity
of
a
contented
husband
no
one
else
took
much
notice
of
the
duke
and
katherine
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
lord
of
misrule
the
bridal
couple
and
the
king
but
geoffrey
chaucer
watched
his
sister
in
law
with
sharp
interest
geoffrey
had
eaten
and
drunk
a
bit
too
much
he
pushed
back
from
the
table
unloosed
his
girdle
and
the
lower
buttons
of
his
pearl
gray
surcote
which
was
too
tight
a
fit
he
had
not
worn
it
since
the
coronation
and
felt
much
easier
in
his
usual
semiclerical
rood
thought
geoffrey
settling
back
in
slightly
tipsy
contentment
little
katherine
had
thoroughly
tamed
that
fierce
plantagenet
leopard
it
must
be
nine
years
that
she
had
enthralled
him
and
to
judge
by
the
duke
s
attitude
now
his
passion
for
her
was
strong
as
ever
that
was
a
long
time
for
the
sweet
fire
to
burn
so
bright
geoffrey
thought
with
a
touch
of
envy
yet
he
had
always
deemed
katherine
an
exceptional
woman
she
had
borne
six
children
she
must
be
about
thirty
but
her
beauty
was
undimmed
though
it
had
acquired
assurance
and
lost
the
touching
wistfulness
the
new
quality
was
not
brazenness
certainly
katherine
could
never
be
that
yet
there
were
changes
her
gown
was
low
cut
as
that
of
edmund
s
promiscuous
isabella
and
katherine
leaned
openly
against
the
duke
s
shoulder
as
she
had
never
used
to
do
still
her
gray
eyes
were
clear
as
crystal
her
high
white
brow
smooth
as
a
girl
s
and
the
new
fashioned
bohemian
headdress
gave
to
her
a
look
of
moon
above
their
faces
unfortunately
suggested
a
horned
cow
it
was
so
with
his
philippa
geoffrey
glanced
sideways
at
his
wife
on
whom
the
wassailing
had
taken
effect
philippa
was
breathing
hard
and
staring
glassy
eyed
at
her
heaped
silver
plate
as
though
daring
it
to
accuse
her
of
being
drunk
thanks
to
katherine
she
was
as
well
gowned
as
any
of
the
noble
ladies
but
her
horned
headdress
had
slipped
over
one
ear
and
its
blue
gauze
veil
trailed
in
the
sauce
philippa
would
be
very
cross
in
the
morning
ah
well
t
is
christmas
and
a
wedding
too
geoffrey
thought
it
was
a
year
of
weddings
and
matchmaking
the
duke
single
hearted
in
all
that
he
did
having
turned
his
mind
to
domestic
matters
had
now
married
off
two
of
his
children
in
ways
most
advantageous
to
their
prosperity
if
not
their
happiness
however
nobody
expected
happiness
from
marriage
and
least
of
all
the
duke
though
he
had
achieved
it
once
even
now
though
geoffrey
was
fat
and
forty
of
the
duchess
blanche
the
duke
had
procured
for
his
henry
another
great
english
heiress
such
as
blanche
had
been
but
the
marriage
of
these
two
children
promised
no
such
felicity
henry
was
thirteen
and
his
bride
twelve
up
there
at
the
high
table
in
her
glittering
finery
one
could
see
the
child
trembling
like
a
little
white
leveret
but
she
would
return
to
her
mother
s
care
tomorrow
the
duke
had
no
intention
of
prematurely
taxing
the
breeding
powers
that
would
eventually
produce
the
next
lancastrian
heir
though
some
less
wise
fathers
threw
the
children
into
bed
together
at
any
age
and
accepted
whatever
consequences
might
arise
she
s
an
ill
tempered
vixen
asserted
philippa
suddenly
enunciating
with
great
care
she
s
scowling
at
me
who
asked
geoffrey
looking
around
and
trying
not
to
laugh
for
his
wife
s
dignity
was
much
impaired
by
the
further
descent
of
her
headdress
philippa
raised
her
spoon
and
pointed
at
the
hawk
nosed

is
simply
that
she
dislikes
this
wedding
scowls
at
everyone
though
it
was
true
that
eleanor
de
bohun
s
angry
eyes
rested
on
philippa
s
dishevelment
with
disgust
her
fish
mouth
was
set
in
continual
disapproval
anyway
thomas
of
woodstock
s

vehemently
agreed
with
her

and
resented
the

perfidy
in
snatching
her

they
had
sent

had
brought
eleanor
to
the

at
all
and
she
made
no

to
be
civil
she
glares
at
me
retorted
philippa
belligerently
because
she
dares
not
be
rude
to
katherine
oh
i
heard
her
in
the
garderobe
squawking
to
her
ladies
that
i
d
no
right
to
be
seated
above
the
salt
grove
and
monterey
sit
side
by
side
on
a
hill
bordering
the
bay
the
two
towns
touch
shoulders
but
they
are
not
alike
whereas
monterey
was
founded
a
long
time
ago
by
foreigners
indians
and
spaniards
and
such
and
the
town
grew
up
higgledy
piggledy
without
plan
or
purpose
pacific
grove
sprang
full
blown
from
the
iron
heart
of
a
psycho
ideo
legal
religion
it
came
fully
equipped
with
laws
ideals
and
customs
on
the
town
s
statute
books
a
deed
is
void
if
liquor
is
ever
brought
on
the
property
cas
a
result
the
sale
of
iron
and
wine
tonic
is
fantastic
pacific
grove
has
a
law
that
requires
you
to
pull
your
shades
down
after
sundown
and
forbids
you
to
pull
them
down
before
scorching
on
bicycles
is
forbidden
as
is
sea
bathing
and
boating
on
sundays
there
is
one
crime
which
is
not
defined
but
which
i
is
definitely
against
the
law
hijinks
are
or
is
forbidden
it
must
be
admitted
that
most
of
these
laws
are
not
enforced
to
the
hilt
the
fence
that
once
surrounded
the
pacific
grove
retreat
is
no
longer
in
existence
once
during
its
history
pacific
grove
was
in
trouble
deep
trouble
you
see
when
the
town
was
founded
many
old
people
moved
to
the
retreat
people
you
d
think
did
nt
have
anything
to
retreat
from
these
old
people
became
grumpy
after
a
while
and
got
to
interfering
in
everything
and
causing
with
two
roque
courts
roque
is
a
complicated
kind
of
croquet
with
narrow
wickets
and
short
handled
mallets
you
play
off
the
sidelines
like
billiards
very
complicated
it
is
they
say
it
develops
character
in
a
local
sport
there
must
be
competition
and
a
prize
in
pacific
grove
a
cup
was
given
every
year
for
the
winning
team
on
the
roque
courts
you
would
nt
think
a
thing
like
that
would
work
up
much
heat
particularly
since
most
of
the
contestants
were
over
seventy
but
it
did
one
of
the
teams
was
called
the
blues
and
the
other
the
reens
the
old
men
wore
little
skullcaps
and
striped
blazers
in
their
team
colors
well
it
was
nt
more
than
two
years
before
hell
broke
loose
the
blues
would
practice
in
the
court
right
alongside
the
greens
but
they
would
nt
speak
to
them
and
then
it
got
into
the
families
of
the
teams
you
were
a
blue
family
or
a
green
family
finally
the
feeling
spread
outside
the
family
you
were
a
partisan
of
got
so
that
the
greens
tried
to
discourage
intermarriage
with
the
blues
and
vice
versa
pretty
soon
it
reached
into
politics
so
that
a
green
would
nt
think
of
voting
for
a
blue
it
split
the
church
right
down
the
middle
the
blues
and
the
greens
would
nt
sit
on
the
same
side
they
made
plans
to
build
separate
churches
of
course
everything
got
really
hot
at
tournament
time
things
were
very
touchy
those
old
men
brought
a
passion
to
the
game
you
would
nt
believe
why
two
octogenarians
would
walk
away
into
the
woods
and
you
d
find
them
locked
in
mortal
combat
they
even
developed
secret
languages
so
that
each
would
nt
know
what
the
other
was
talking
about
well
things
got
so
hot
and
feeling
ran
so
high
that
the
county
had
to
take
notice
of
it
a
blue
got
his
house
burned
down
and
then
a
green
was
found
clubbed
to
death
with
a
roque
mallet
in
the
woods
a
roque
mallet
is
short
handled
and
heavy
and
can
be
a
very
deadly
tied
to
their
wrists
by
thongs
like
battle
axes
they
did
nt
go
any
place
without
them
there
was
nt
any
crime
each
did
nt
charge
the
other
with
including
things
they
d
outgrown
and
could
nt
have
done
if
they
d
wanted
to
the
blues
would
nt
trade
in
green
stores
the
whole
town
was
a
mess
the
original
benefactor
mr
deems
was
a
nice
old
fellow
he
used
to
smoke
a
little
opium
when
it
was
legal
and
this
kept
him
healthy
and
rested
so
that
he
did
nt
get
high
blood
pressure
or
tuberculosis
he
was
a
benevolent
man
but
he
was
also
a
philosopher
when
he
saw
what
he
had
created
by
giving
the
roque
courts
to
the
pacific
grove
retreat
he
was
saddened
and
later
horrified
he
said
he
knew
how
god
felt
the
tournament
came
july
and
feeling
was
so
bad
that
people
were
carrying
pistols
blue
kids
and
green
kids
had
gang
wars
mr
deems
after
a
period
of
years
he
might
as
well
act
like
god
there
was
too
much
violence
in
town
on
the
night
of
july
mr
deems
sent
out
a
bulldozer
in
the
morning
where
the
roque
courts
had
been
there
was
only
a
deep
ragged
hole
in
the
ground
if
he
d
had
time
he
would
have
continued
god
s
solution
he
d
have
filled
the
hole
with
water
they
ran
mr
deems
out
of
pacific
grove
they
would
have
tarred
and
feathered
him
if
they
could
have
caught
him
but
he
was
safe
in
monterey
cooking
his
yen
shi
over
a
peanut
oil
lamp
every
july
to
this
day
the
whole
town
of
pacific
grove
gets
together
and
burns
mr
deems
in
effigy
they
make
a
celebration
of
it
dress
up
a
life
size
figure
and
hang
it
from
a
pine
tree
later
they
burn
it
people
march
underneath
with
torches
and
the
poor
helpless
figure
of
mr
deems
goes
up
in
smoke
every
year
here
are
people
who
will
say
that
this
whole
account
is
lie
even
if
it
did
nt
necessarily
happen
to
a
casual
observer
cannery
row
might
have
seemed
a
series
of
self
contained
and
selfish
units
each
functioning
alone
with
no
reference
to
the
others
there
was
little
visible
connection
between
la
ida
s
the
bear
flag
the
grocery
still
known
as
lee
chong
s
heavenly
flower
grocery
the
palace
flophouse
and
western
biological
laboratories
the
fact
is
that
each
an
few
pilots
were
familiar
with
more
than
certain
stretches
of
given
rivers
all
at
once
aware
of
a
quickening
vibration
beneath
his
boot
soles
matt
peered
helplessly
into
that
wall
of
gloom
beyond
the
wheelhouse
s
open
windows
godfreys
it
had
grown
mighty
thick
out
there
hal
there
it
is
perceptibly
the
contraband
runner
s
easy
prbgress
slackened
while
she
passed
over
a
bar
and
felt
the
tug
of
the
bottom
the
vibration
also
became
briefly
intensified
then
decreased
as
the
westernarrow
re
entered
deep
water
what
sort
of
reception
would
they
be
accorded
at
new
madrid
the
confederate
s
commander
especially
if
he
were
new
on
this
station
might
still
be
smarting
over
the
loss
of
fort
henry
and
so
confiscate
the
western
arrow
and
imprison
her
crew
it
went
without
saying
that
the
southerners
must
also
be
anxious
over
the
outcome
of
that
big
fight
shaping
up
around
strategically
vital
fort
donelson
in
cairo
generals
grant
smith
and
mcclernand
had
been
reported
to
be
closing
in
on
that
fortress
like
the
jaws
of
philo

must
be
close
to
five
matt
i
m
telling
parker
to
reduce
speed
thrice
he
pulled
a
signal
bell
cord
with
the
result
that
presently
little
tongues
of
flame
no
longer
curled
through
the
smokepipe
s
iron
crowns
and
the
western
arrow
s
paddle
wheel
slowed
reckon
you
d
best
warn
bullwinkle
to
rig
our
signal
lanterns
philo
drawled
but
just
then
the
swift
little
freighter
became
illumined
by
a
series
of
blindingly
bright
flashes
off
to
starboard
then
a
roundshot
and
some
shells
screamed
by
sickeningly
close
to
the
wheelhouse
somethingstruck
the
contraband
runner
aft
heeled
her
over
and
caused

noise

he
cramped
the

down

a

so
presented
a

to

bullwinkle
came
pounding
up
from

cursing
wildly

even
as

red

were
run
up
the

s

fired
for
a
second
time
luckily
this
time
it
scored
no
hits
thanks
to
a
previous
visit
to
new
madrid
matt
knew
what
ought
tobe
expected
once
they
left
behind
the
frowning
but
mercifully
silent
batteries
of
island
number
ten
new
madrid
was
a
thriving
river
town
situated
on
dangerously
low
ground
it
now
was
crowded
beyond
belief
by
the
approach
of
fighting
its
sun
bleached
unpainted
and
uninspired
buildings
rose
upon
the
missouri
shore
sprawled
untidily
away
from
behindits
levee
and
a
row
of
warehouses
the
court
house
modelled
on
the
usual
greek
temple
was
the
only
important
building
in
evidence
still
new
madrid
remained
a
pretty
place
backed
by
tall
woods
and
dotted
with
towering
live
oaks
trailing
ghostly
gray
beards
of
spanish
moss
from
gnarled
branches
profound
indeed
had
been
the
relief
of
everyone
aboard
the
western
arrow
when
beyond
a
single
challenging
gun
to
which
mr
bullwinkle
had
responded
had
remained
silent
matt
decided
that
if
union
gunboats
ever
steamed
this
far
south
they
would
be
in
for
a
very
hot
fight
at
this
point
the
mississippi
turned
almost
back
upon
its
course
forcing
traffic
to
hug
the
eastern
shore
a
surprising
number
of
steamboats
lay
tied
up
along
new
madrid
s
waterfront
the
vessels
most
noticeable
amid
the
huddle
of
transports
freighters
and
tugs
were
two
ironclad
confederate
gunboats
general
van
dorn
and
general
jeff
thompson
both
were
single
funnelled
sidewheelers
and
undoubtedly
much
faster
than
any
ironclads
matt
had
ever
beheld
protected
by
casemates
made
of
railroad
rails
bolted
together
these
small
men
of
war
appeared
grimly
efficient
silently
their
crews
tramped
out
on
deck
to
watch
this
low
dull
black
painted
sternwheeler
come
nosing
cautiously
into
the
levee
undoubtedly
the
white
flag
fluttering
at
the
jackstaff
where
the
stars
and
stripes
previously
had
been
shown
must
have
aroused
curiosity
for
numbers
of
confederate
soldiers
mostly
clad
in
butternut
tinted
uniforms
or
parts
thereof
came
shambling
along
the
streets
of
new
madrid
to
loaf
about
the
levee
and
there
were
also
a
good
many
rag
clad
negroes
in
evidence
but
practically
no
civilians
probably
it
was
too
early
in
the
day
sleet
had
given
way
to
rain
which
lashed
at
the
western
arrow
s
superstructure
and
the
wide
guards
running
along
her
sides
no
sooner
had
the
steamboat
s
landing
stage
been
lowered
than
matt
cassius
bullwinkle
and
philo
daingerfield
tramped
ashore
and
sought
a
small
group
of
civilians
wearing
ponchos
and
stovepipe
hats
significantly
only
a
single
military
figure
was
on
hand
a
stout
red
bearded
fellow
wearing
a
wrinkled
gray
tunic
which
bore
the
braid
of
a
major
curling
up
its
sleeves
his
trousers
muddied
to
the
knees
however
were
of
checkered
wool
and
tucked
into
clumsy
cowhide
boots
he
wore
a
black
slouch
hat
with
brim
turned
down
to
ward
off
the
rain
kepis
evidently
were
not
popular
or
more
probably
unobtainable
in
this
theatre
of
the
war
matt
splashing
through
mire
and
horse
droppings
towards
the
group
waiting
under
a
rickety
shed
reflected
on
what
he
had
just
made
and
new
batteries
added
at
fort
bankhead
situated
on
a
bluff
immediately
upriver
and
in
fort
thompson
a
little
way
downstream
many
more
troops
were
in
evidence
that
the
confederate
high
command
intended
to
hold
this
strategically
important
town
of
new
madrid
in
force
was
evinced
by
the
fact
that
on
a
near
by
levee
cannon
of
heavy
calibre
were
being
craned
out
of
a
pair
of
barges
which
must
have
been
towed
up
from
memphis
and
vicksburg
matt
recognized
several
individuals
standing
in
dripping
raincapes
and
ponchos
among
them
he
was

macdougall
added
we

here
digging

out
of
the
sand
macdougall
had
left
the
removable
canopy
of
the
command
boat
ashore
this
morning
preferring
the
better
visibility
of
an
open
boat
when
midday
sun
had
scorched
down
he
had
momentarily
regretted
this
decision
now
he
was
glad
he
and
hatcher
could
see
all
around
and
the
deckhands
could
get
about
to
handle
their
lines
in
a
hurry
he
stood
on
the
decked
overbow
just
forward
of
hatcher
and
the
wheel
here
he
was
clear
of
the
towline
and
could
watch
beach
boats
and
sea
from
time
to
time
he
threw
heaving
lines
to
landing
craft
in
need
of
help
the
towline
was
fastened
to
the
heaving
line
deckhands
in
troubled
vps
hauled
it
aboard
and
dropped
the
eye
over
their
sternposts
after
each
craft
had
been
safely
retracted
towline
and
heaving

were
recovered
and
gotten

for
the
next

most
of
the

was
ashore
now
in
the
face
of
a
freshening
wind
soldiers
and
sailors
alike
were
working
in
an
excited

frenzy
laughing

with
concern
while
two
lcvps
loaded
with

headed
through

together
they
could
not
be
handled
at
once
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
throwing

ashore
they
must
have
disregarded

to

at
a
time
he
had
better
get
over
there

he
called
sharply
pointing
to

out

those
big
rollers
coming
in
along
the
shallows
hatcher
opened
throttle
the
command
boat
rose
on
a
swell
and
ran
across
the
little
cove
just
outside
the
breakers
then
headed
in
towards
the
two
vps
the
rolling
swell
was
much
heavier
here
at
the
edge
of
the
cove
the
two
boats
were
already
in
trouble
in
spite
of
anything
their
coxswains
could
do
they
drifted
closer
to
the
shallow
rim
where
surf
crashed
frighteningly
against
sloping
sand
when
within
hailing
distance
macdougall
climbed
upon
the
bow
of

his
back
to

he
steadied
himself
guns
which
were
just
forward
of
the
cockpit
and
hailed
the
two
coxswains
ahoy
in
the
vps
back
out
of
there
you
re
in
too
far
to
straighten
out
now
you
ll
get
pooped
with
a
sea
and
broach
hard
on
that
reef
back
clear
of
the
surf
and
get
out
of
there
back
out
both
coxswains
heard
his
shouts
but
did
not
seem
to
understand
they
looked
around
at
macdougall
faces
bewildered
doing
nothing
unless
they
acted
their
boats
were
doomed
now
the
command
boat
rose
high
on
a
rolling
swell
lurched
about
weathered
the
crest
and
dropped
into
the
trough
behind
it
the
machine
gun
barrel
to
which
macdougall
clung
swung
around
he
staggered
for
a
moment
then
reached
for
a
new
grip
on
the
gun
and
raised
his
megaphone
those
vps
would
never
make
it
unless
they
turned
fast
between
swells
and
got
out
of
there
hatcher
shouted
a
warning
to
macdougall
look
the
sea
macdougall
turned
around
and
looked
of
his
boat
and
almost
upon
them
this
was
what
luke
stephens
had
been
talking
about
there
was
no
chance
of
escape
frorn
it
macdougall
shouted
back
to
hatcher
open
her
up
and
head
into
it
with
mouth
wide
open
hatcher
gaped
at
the
enormous
wave
yet
gunned
his
motor
at
once
and
spun
his
wheel
swinging
the
command
boat
nearly
head
on
to
it
take
it
on
the
shoulder
yelled
macdougall
gripping
his
gun
barrel
and
looking
up
at
the
sea
that
s
it
hold
her
there
get
some
way
on
her
quick
no
time
to
scramble
back
to
the
comparative
safety
of
the
cockpit
macdougall
wrapped
both
arms
around
the
machine
gun
and
hung
on
the
boat
had
beam
and
power
if
she
could
only
plane
over
the
top
hey
were
into
the
first
wave
now
it
did
not
seem
possible
for
them
to
rise
over
it
but
the
bow
continued
to
lift
higher
and
yet
higher
it
planing
while
hatcher
macdougall
and
the
boat
s
crew
held
their
breath
the
body
of
the
wave
swept
under
them
lifting
the
boat
by
the
middle
bow
and
stern
hanging
in
space
propeller
racing
in
agony
until
hatcher
was
able
to
move
his
hand
to
the
throttle
squatting
with
feet
braced
apart
macdougall
rode
the
bow
clinging
desperately
to
the
gun
thrust
high
he
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
craft
shore
and
waves
in
the
distance
but
his
attention
was
drawn
to
the
deep
valley
of
water
before
him
then
with
a
sickening
sensation
as
if
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
from
under
the
boat
it
plummeted
into
the
deep
trough
and
brought
up
with
a
shuddering
crash
which
nearly
knocked
the
breath
out
of
him
macdougall
looked
up
at
the
second
wave
it
was
bigger
and
higher
than
the
first
towering
above
them
in
a
sheer
green
wall
with
sunlight
gleaming
through
from
the
other
side
and
foaming
crest
leering
down
upon
them
he
knew
that
the
boat
the
first
wave
the
bow
rose
too
slowly
these
new
made
hawaiian
seas
were
steep
and
close
together
the
boat
was
out
of
timing
in
his
palestinian
yarmulke
embroidered
in
gold
thread
and
his
magnificently
braided
taleth
and
delivered
his
little
speech
of
gratitude
to
parents
and
rabbi
in
a
confidentphebrew
that
brought
murmurs
of
delight
and
appreciation
from
the
congregation
what
was
more
important
he
had
discovered
that
at
thirteen
he
knew
more
than
his
father
they
told
him
he
was
entering
manhood
even
his
father
had
to
concede
it
because
it
was
so
written
although
but
even
though
he
had
suspected
that
his
father
s
piousness
like
his
philosophizing
about
business
which
morrow
realized
later
was
cribbed
from
the
columns
of
arthur
brisbane
and
roger
babson
was
false
and
hypocritical
it
came
as
a
shock
to
know
that
he
himself
could
prove
at
least
that
his
father
s
ponderous
showing
off
of
his
religious
knowledge
was
that
of
an
essentially
ignorant
man
it
was
then
that
he
must
have
decided
to
become
a
rabbi
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
the
rabbinate
would
put
him
once
and
for
all
beyond
his
father
s
reach
the
period
of
religious
intoxication
had
gone
on
for
six
months
with
enough
fussiness
about
ritual
and
dogma
to
set
even
his
mother
s
teeth
on
edge
with
his
little
sister
staring
at
him
in
bewilderment
as
he
wound
his
phylacteries
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
at
its
peak
he
had
pleaded
to
be
transferred
from
james
monroe
high
to
a
torah
true
yeshiva
in
preparation
for
his
future
rabbinical
studies
and
then
it
had
stopped
stopped
so
completely
that
joke
the
eternal
reference
to
the
days
when
morrow
actually
fasted
like
a
saint
and
swore
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
rabbi
why
he
had
never
really
thought
about
it
any
more
than
you
think
of
the
color
or
pattern
of
a
suit
that
you
have
outgrown
but
it
seemed
obvious
to
him
now
that
it
was
not
just
a
quirk
of
adolescence
like
a
romance
with
a
girl
who
encountered
years
later
seems
utterly
ordinary
and
unexciting
but
an
emotional
response
to
his
father
s
demand
for
unquestioning
recognition
and
as
soon
as
his
father
indicated
that
he
was
willing
for
him
to
go
ahead
with
his
dream
of
becoming
a
man
of
god
the
whole
basis
for
his
response
was
destroyed
and
hep
turned
back
first
to
baseball
then
to
girls
had
his
father
really
foreseen
what
would
happen
was
he
shrewd
enough
to
realize
that
the
quickest
way
to
free
morrow
from
the
infatuation
with
an
idea
which
to
the
rest
of
the
family
meant
only
the
sabbath
candles
was
by
pretending
a
much
more
likely
did
his
own
clinging
to
the
forms
if
not
the
core
of
the
ancient
faith
put
him
in
such
an
awkward
position
that
he
could
not
declare
his
opposition
to
this
impractical
ambition
without
at
the
same
time
exposing
his
own
hypocrisy
so
that
he
had
to
acquiesce
in
an
abhorrent
decision
which
meant
the
death
of
his
material
ambitions
for
his
son
whatever
the
case
he
had
put
the
quietus
on
the
whole
thing
as
effectively
as
if
he
had
gone
to
a
child
psychologist
for
professional
advice
and
as
a
result
he
had
forced
morrow
into
a
more
subterranean
form
of
opposition
morrow
adopted
a
surface
agreeableness
that
was
part
of
the
war
and
yet
could
only
disarm
his
father
coupled
with
an
underground
struggle
that
was
quiet
relentless
and
unremitting
as
he
finished
high
school
and
went
meekly
off
to
business
college
like
a
repentant
boy
led
away
to
reform
school
for
he
hated
his
father
he
never
hid
it
from
himself
although
he
behaved
correctly
and
rarely
gave
cause
who
was
not
a
fool
became
aware
of
the
hatred
and
was
furious
in
his
helplessness
to
counter
it
even
though
he
did
his
best
to
thrust
his
moneyed
fist
at
the
draft
board
and
the
army
in
an
effort
to
reassert
his
parental
omnipotence
once
morrow
proud
of
his
sister
s
looks
and
eager
to
establish
some
common
ground
between
them
or
perhaps
so
it
seemed
to
him
now
simply
casting
about
in
his
loneliness
for
support
in
the
long
drawn
out
guerrilla
battle
had
attempted
to
take
her
into
his
confidence
to
reveal
to
her
the
roots
of
his
feelings
and
the
reasonable
basis
for
she
prided
herself
even
as
an
adolescent
on
her
passionate
devotion
to
what
she
thought
of
as
reality
as
opposed
to
the
idealism
of
religion
or
any
abstract
ideas
for
his
hatred
of
their
father
only
once
but
never
again
after
that
they
had
been
flung
even
farther
apart
not
just
by
physical
distance
but
by
the
polar
extremes
of
their
feelings
about
their
father
and
inevitably
they
lapsed
brother
sister
relationship
that
only
widened
the
gulf
between
them
so
inappropriate
and
foreign
was
it
to
their
natures
for
no
sooner
had
he
attempted
to
tell
her
what
herman
felton
was
really
like
as
a
prelude
to
an
explanation
of
his
determination
to
undermine
their
father
than
she
had
flown
into
a
wildly
irrational
rage
and
he
discovered
that
betsy
adored
their
father
she
worshiped
him
and
whatever
reservations
she
had
as
to
his
completeness
and
perfection
she
wanted
to
consider
in
solitude
if
not
to
suppress
entirely
all
the
little
girlish
daughterly
tricks
jumping
on
daddy
s
lap
bringing
him
his
evening
paper
like
a
puppy
ruffling
his
hair
and
then
carefully
combing
it
these
were
nt
simply
stunts
she
had
picked
up
at
the
movies
but
real
expressions
of
a
devotion
and
awe
that
she
had
no
other
legitimate
means
of
expressing
still
he
tried
spurred
on
doggedly
by
the
fear
that
betsy
would
be
drowned
in
a
sea
of
adoration
and
admiration
for
just
those
character
traits
to
which
she
should
have
been
most
hostile
they
day
and
before
plunging
into
the
subway
for
the
ride
up
to
the
bronx
he
had
treated
her
to
a
soda
at
loft
s
do
nt
you
see
he
said
watching
her
greedily
suck
up
the
her
own
pleasure
he
would
be
hers
she
never
thought
that
she
would
be
his
it
simply
never
occurred
to
her
to
think
of
herself
as
his
whatever
he
would
do
with
her
caress
her
lie
on
top
of
her
insert
himself
in
her
was
part
of
her
wakeful
dream
of
undefined
sensuality
of
which
he
was
the
essential
and
enormously
desirable
instrument
she
was
convinced
that
he
never
had
seen
a
live
nude
woman
close
to
and
she
would
lock
her
door
and
parade
herself
about
her
bed
wearing
no
clothing
and
pretend
that
he
was
lying
on
the
bed
and
looking
at
her
for
the
first
time
she
had
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
figure
it
was
a
time
of
the
long
tailored
line
skirt
blouse
and
ankle
length
coat
following
the
natural
waistline
the
design
was
to
make
women
look
tall
with
vertical
stitching
and
piping
to
further
the
scheme
edith
was
an
ideal
model
for
the
suits
and
dresses
and
even
the
hats
which
were
enormous
and
elaborate
and
expensive
were
if
not
becoming
effective
in
drawing
the
attention
away
from
the
face
that
was
less
than
beautiful
no
man
ever
had
seen
her
unclothed
and
that
too
was
going
to
be
part
of
the
great
sensuality
when
she
owned
joe
she
was
quite
aware
that
men
of
her
class
expected
the
girls
of
her
class
to
be
virgins
and
inmost
cases
the
expectation
was
justified
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
expect
limited
only
by
her
unlimited
imagination
she
conducted
orgies
of
the
mind
with
herself
after
an
evening
with
joe
while
at
all
other
times
maintaining
a
calm
that
was
her
public
character
it
was
also
the
character
she
presented
to
joe
chapin
calm
attentive
interested
sympathetic
eager
to
learn
after
a
while
he
became
totally
dependent
upon
her
without
realizing
it
gradually
other
girls
had
become
he
told
her
so
frivolous
and
empty
headed
that
he
was
regretting
invitations
that
would
involve
his
having
to
be
paired
off
with
them
his
own
friends
too
his
contemporaries
were
beginning
to
appear
in
a
bad
light
they
were
not
taking
things
seriously
enough
not
buckling
down
to
work
not
thinking
things
through
it
was
not
exactly
their
fault
he
said
they
had
no
one
to
help
them
think
things
through
with
this
conversation
edith
moved
into
the
first
stage
of
owning
him
she
began
to
let
him
do
things
for
her
she
would
ask
him
to
stop
at
a
shop
to
pick
up
something
she
had
ordered
she
had
him
do
little
errands
for
her
on
his
visits
to
philadelphia
she
asked
for
and
took
his
advice
on
investing
a
small
sum
of
cash
she
had
him
read
a
letter
of
sympathy
she
had
composed
on
the
death
of
a
far
off
cousin
she
sought
his
truth
she
never
intended
to
take
then
so
fortuitously
that
she
would
not
have
dared
plan
it
she
was
stricken
with
acute
appendicitis
and
had
to
undergo
emergency
surgery
at
that
time
the
appendectomy
was
years
away
from
the
routine
operation
it
was
later
to
become
and
a
stay
in
the
hospital
was
likewise
a
matter
for
great
concern
the
newspapers
of
the
day
always
spoke
of
a
patient
as
going
under
the
knife
chloroform
was
the
usual
an
aesthetic
and
the
word
hospital
was
considered
to
be
suitable
evidence
of
the
extremity
of
the
patient
s
condition
the
horses
drawing
the
ambulance
proceeded
at
a
walk
or
a
slow
trot
and
the
ambulance
hell
pressed
by
a
large
pedal
button
was
more
of
an
announcement
than
a
warning
signal
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
rode
inside
with
the
patient
and
because
of
the
comparatively
slow
pace
of
the
team
of
bays
the
citizens
were
able
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
faces
of
the
professionals
the
faces
told
little
more
than
the
seriousness
of
their
mission
itself
was
likely
to
dispel
fear
or
create
optimism
it
was
a
social
convention
that
visits
to
hospital
patients
were
restricted
to
members
of
the
immediate
families
this
was
no
less
true
for
patients
in
private
rooms
and
it
was
especially
true
where
the
patient
was
an
unmarried
young
woman
when
joe
chapin
read
in
the
paper
that
edith
had
been
taken
to
the
hospital
lie
first
paid
a
call
on
dr
english
at
the
doctor
s
office
the
doctor
revealed
that
it
had
been
a
nasty
operation
and
that
edith
had
been
on
the
table
almost
three
hours
in
the
tradition
of
his
calling
the
doctor
employed
words
of
greek
and
latin
origin
that
joe
chapin
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
but
in
reply
to
the
direct
question
dr
english
cautiously
admitted
that
edith
would
live
barring
unforeseen
complications
when
do
you
think
i
can
go
to
see
her
bill
said
joe
chapin
had
you
intended
to
go
see
her
well
i
would
like
to
if
possible
well
said
dr
english
and
you
understand
of
course
you
d
have
to
have
permission
from
her
family
oh
of
course
i
do
nt
as
a
rule
encourage
visiting
joe
edith
has
a
day
nurse
and
a
night
nurse
she
s
still
on
the
critical
list
and
i
should
think
it
d
be
a
week
before
she
d
be
ready
to
see
anybody
except
her
family
i
ll
abide
by
your
decision
but
i
m
really
very
anxious
to
see
her
yes
yes
that
hardly
comes
as
a
surprise
and
very
understandable
but
for
the
time
being
i
m
keeping
a
close
watch
on
her
to
guard
against
any
post
operative
complications
you
understand
of
course
and
as
a
man
of
the
world
you
understand
that
a
young
lady
does
nt
always
look
her
best
in
a
hospital
gown
so
there
s
that
to
consider
bill
i
have
to
tell
you
this
i
but
i
m
in
love
with
edith
i
m
glad
to
hear
that
joe
not
altogether
surprised
but
i
m
glad
to
hear
it
i
ll
tell
you
what
who
was
leaning
out
of
the
car
and
talking
to
him
very
rapidly
her
hand
with
outspread
fingers
going
up
and
down
as
it
did
when
she
was
very
serious
and
emphatic
what
struck
me
with
sickening
force
was
how
should
i
put
it
the
voluble
familiarity
of
her
way
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
oh
for
weeks
and
weeks
i
saw
him
scratch
his
cheek
and
nod
and
turn
and
walk
back
to
his
convertible
a
broad
and
thickish
man
of
my
age
somewhat
resembling
gustave
trapp
a
cousin
of
my
father
s
in
switzerland
same
smoothly
tanned
face
fuller
than
mine
with
a
small
dark
mustache
and
a
rosebud
degenerate
mouth
lolita
was
studying
a
road
map
when
i
got
back
into
the
car
what
did
that
man
ask
you
lo
man
oh
that
man
oh
yes
oh
i
do
nt
know
he
wondered
if
i
had
a
map
drove
on
and
i
said
now
listen
lo
i
do
not
know
whether
you
are
lying
or
not
and
i
do
not
know
whether
you
are
insane
or
not
and
i
do
not
care
for
the
moment
but
that
person
has
been
following
us
all
day
and
his
car
was
at
the
motel
yesterday
and
i
think
he
is
a
cop
you
know
perfectly
well
what
will
happen
and
where
you
will
go
if
the
police
find
out
about
things
now
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
he
said
to
you
and
what
you
told
him
she
laughed
if
he
s
really
a
cop
she
said
shrilly
but
not
illogically
the
worst
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
show
him
we
are
scared
ignore
him
dad
did
he
ask
where
we
were
going
oh
he
knows
that
mocking
me
anyway
i
said
giving
up
i
have
seen
his
face
now
a
relative
of
mine
called
trapp
perhaps
he
is
trapp
if
i
were
you
oh
look
all
the
nines
are
changing
into
the
next
thousand
when
i
was
a
little
kid
she
continued
unexpectedly
i
used
to
think
they
d
stop
and
go
back
to
nines
if
only
my
mother
agreed
to
put
the
car
in
reverse
it
was
the
first
time
i
think
she
spoke
spontaneously
of
her
pre
humbertian
childhood
perhaps
the
theatre
had
taught
her
that
trick
and
silently
we
travelled
on
unpursued
but
next
day
like
pain
in
a
fatal
disease
that
cones
back
as
the
drug
and
hope
wear
off
there
it
was
again
behind
us
that
glossy
red
beast
the
traffic
on
the
highway
was
light
that
day
nobody
passed
anybody
and
nobody
attempted
to
get
in
between
our
humble
blue
car
and
its
imperious
red
shadow
as
if
there
were
some
spell
cast
on
that
interspace
a
zone
of
evil
mirth
and
magic
a
that
was
almost
artistic
the
driver
behind
me
with
his
stuffed
shoulders
and
trappish
mustache
looked
like
a
display
dummy
and
his
convertible
seemed
to
move
only
because
an
invisible
rope
of
silent
silk
connected
it
with
our
shabby
vehicle
we
were
many
times
weaker
than
his
splendid
lacquered
machine
so
that
i
did
not
even
attempt
to
outspeed
him
lente
currite
noctis
equi
softly
run
nightmares
we
climbed
long
grades
and
rolled
downhill
again
and
heeded
speed
limits
and
spared
slow
children
and
reproduced
in
sweeping
terms
the
black
wiggles
of
curves
on
their
yellow
shields
and
no
matter
how
and
where
we
drove
the
enchanted
interspace
slid
on
intact
mathematical
mirage
like
the
viatic
counterpart
of
a
magic
carpet
and
all
the
time
i
was
aware
of
a
private
blaze
on
my
right
her
joyful
eye
her
flaming
cheek
a
traffic
policeman
deep
in
the
nightmare
of
crisscross
streets
at
half
past
four
p
m
in
a
factory
town
was
the
hand
of
chance
that
then
with
the
same
hand
cut
off
my
shadow
a
score
of
cars
were
launched
in
between
us
and
i
sped
on
and
deftly
turned
into
a
narrow
lane
a
sparrow
alighted
with
a
jumbo
bread
crumb
was
tackled
by
another
and
lost
the
crumb
when
after
a
few
grim
stoppages
and
a
bit
of
deliberate
meandering
i
returned
to
the
highway
our
shadow
had
disappeared
lola
snorted
and
said
if
he
is
what
you
think
he
is
how
silly
to
give
him
the
slip
i
have
other
notions
by
now
i
said
you
should
ah
check
them
by
ah
keeping
in
touch
with
him
fahther
deah
said
lo
writhing
in
the
coils
of
her
own
sarcasm
gee
you
are
mean
she
added
in
her
ordinary
voice
we
spent
a
grim
night
in
a
very
foul
cabin
under
a
sonorous
amplitude
of
rain
and
with
a
kind
of
prehistorically
loud
thunder
incessantly
rolling
above
us
lightning
said
lo
whose
dread
of
electric
storms
gave
me
some
pathetic
solace
we
had
breakfast
in
the
township
of
soda
pop
iooi
judging
by
the
terminal
figure
i
remarked
fatface
is
already
here
your
humor
said
lo
is
sidesplitting
deah
fahther
we
were
in
sage
brush
country
by
that
time
and
there
was
a
day
or
two
of
lovely
release
i
had
been
a
fool
all
was
well
that
discomfort
was
merely
a
trapped
flatus
and
presently
the
mesas
gave
way
to
real
mountains
and
on
time
we
drove
into
wace
oh
disaster
some
confusion
had
occurred
she
had
misread
a
date
in
the
tour
book
and
the
magic
cave
ceremonies
were
over
she
took
it
bravely
i
must
admit
and
when
we
discovered
there
was
in
kurortish
wace
a
summer
theatre
in
full
swing
we
naturally
drifted
toward
it
one
fair
mid
june
evening
i
really
could
not
tell
you
the
no
doubt
with
self
conscious
light
effects
and
a
mediocre
leading
lady
the
only
detail
that
pleased
me
was
a
garland
of
seven
little
graces
more
or
less
immobile
prettily
painted
bare
limbed
seven
bemused
pubescent
girls
in
colored
gauze
that
had
been
recruited
locally
judging
by
the
partisan
flurry
here
and
there
among
the
audience
and
were
supposed
to
the
brandy
holly
asked
smiling
just
a
couple
and
then
i
either
go
on
the
wireless
as
an
announcer
or
return
to
being
a
white
hunter
peter
said
in
the
african
make
up
there
is
really
no
such
thing
as
love
kindness
or
gratitude
as
we
know
it
because
they
have
lived
all
their
lives
and
their
ancestors
lives
in
an
atmosphere
of
terror
and
violence
there
is
no
proper
love
between
man
and
woman
because
the
woman
is
bought
for
goats
and
is
used
as
a
beast
of
burden
there
is
no
gratitude
because
it
would
never
occur
to
them
to
give
anything
to
anybody
else
and
from
others
they
lie
habitually
because
to
lie
is
the
correct
procedure
else
some
enemy
might
find
a
way
to
do
them
damage
if
they
tell
the
truth
they
have
no
sensitivity
about
inflicting
pain
or
receiving
pain
because
their
whole
religion
is
based
on
blood
and
torture
of
animals
and
each
other
they
think
even
the
best
of
them
that
nothing
s
funnier
than
a
wounded
animal
or
a
crippled
animal
it
s
a
big
joke
i
do
nt
even
think
that
they
themselves
feel
pain
the
way
we
do
i
ve
seen
em
with
their
legs
broken
and
the
bones
sticking
out
and
i
ve
seen
masai
youngsters
half
eaten
by
lions
you
sew
em
up
with
a
sail
needle
and
they
grin
like
it
was
fine
fun
i
must
say
they
re
good
to
their
kids
as
a
rule
but
maybe
that
s
because
the
female
children
represent
a
big
annuity
for
the
family
and
the
males
are
tomorrow
s
warriors
and
day
after
tomorrow
s
tribal
elders
and
the
black
coffee
boy
came
with
his
wheeled
tray
holly
poured
the
coffee
one
sugar
please
tom
said
you
d
say
this
applies
to
all
the
tribes
or
just
to
these
what
do
you
call
them
kyuku
kikuyu
mostly
the
kikuyu
for
two
reasons
mainly
they
have
a
reputation
amongst
the
other
tribes
as
crafty
witch
hounded
lying
sea
lawyers
they
were
never
proper
warriors
or
hunters
but
always
shifty
agriculturists
and
sneaky
murderers
forever
out
to
do
the
next
bloke
in
the
eye
their
system
of
land
tenure
is
one
of
the
most
complicated
in
the
world
and
so
is
the
tribal
setup
for
instance
all
the
agitators
like
kenyatta
and
the
other
boys
that
ran
the
old
kikuyu
central
association
which
was
banned
for
subversion
at
the
start
of
the
war
and
its
present
successor
the
kenya
african
union
are
always
screaming
about
us
taking
the
kikuyu
land
actually
where
they
scream
the
loudest
they
never
we
gave
em
a
new
reservation
you
ll
see
it
and
took
up
land
for
ourselves
the
land
we
actually
got
from
the
kyukes
we
paid
for
but
then
the
agitators
say
that
no
one
kikuyu
can
sell
any
land
at
all
to
anybody
it
s
a
business
for
the
clan
and
then
it
gets
to
be
the
business
of
all
the
clans
the
kyukes
do
nt
say
much
about
the
fact
that
they
took
most
of
what
they
call
their
own
ground
from
a
bunch
of
wild
hunters
named
wandrobo
first
paying
for
it
by
agreement
and
then
gradually
forcing
the
wandrobo
out
like
the
camel
that
stuck
his
head
in
the
tent
to
understand
the
clan
system
you
have
to
understand
that
every
child
is
his
own
grandfather
which
makes
him
the
father
of
his
father
and
his
uncle
is
his
brother
and
so
forth
and
it
works
the
same
way
more
or
less
on
the
female
side
everybody
is
everybody
else
including
his
dead
ancestor
member
the
main
thing
is
that
they
fell
smack
in
the
path
of
our
movements
out
here
so
we
ve
had
em
for
neighbors
and
god
knows
we
have
nt
helped
them
any
now
by
damn
i
will
stop
somebody
else
talk
i
never
ran
on
before
like
this
in
my
life
i
m
winded
i
assume
then
nancy
said
that
you
actually
like
the
individual
negro
but
only
in
certain
categories
and
always
as
an
inferior
peter
looked
up
almost
but
not
quite
angry
they
damned
well
are
my
inferiors
in
the
white
man
s
world
as
we
know
it
out
here
i
do
nt
mean
to
be
rude
but
you
ve
been
in
nairobi
only
half
a
day
i
admire
a
great
many
of
their
skills
and
i
love
the
true
savage
on
his
own
savage
ground
and
i
love
a
great
many
things
about
all
the
tribes
but
i
live
here
i
was
raised
here
and
i
know
sit
in
the
legislative
assembly
it
s
a
method
of
thinking
for
a
start
they
tried
the
equality
thing
once
in
a
trial
letting
the
elders
decide
the
guilt
of
a
proven
murderer
they
d
found
the
murderer
literally
pulling
the
spear
out
of
the
dead
man
the
elders
acquitted
him
they
asked
why
for
the
acquittal
and
one
elder
said
it
is
well
known
that
kikuyu
never
murder
the
next
one
said
the
accused
owed
me
six
goats
the
third
one
said
the
accused
was
my
cousin
now
that
is
all
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
wet
bright
night
in
nairobi
my
apologies
for
nancy
tom
deane
said
but
she
took
a
couple
courses
of
sociology
in
her
senior
year
in
college
somebody
told
her
sociology
courses
had
no
labs
well
i
m
curious
nancy
said
i
do
nt
see
any
point
in
coming
all
the
way
out
here
without
asking
some
questions
buy
i
m
sorry
i
was
b
minded
eland
straps
sure
when
a
wog
loves
his
manamouki
very
much
he
gets
her
some
eland
straps
as
a
token
of
affection
what
is
a
manamouki
exactly
and
this
business
of
eland
straps
whatever
they
are
well
a
manamouki
is
the
best
word
for
female
in
swahili
it
means
she
thing
whether
it
applies
to
animal
or
human
that
is
what
a
she
thing
is
called
manamouki
there
is
nt
of
aeschylus
she
spelled
it
escylus
sophocles
euripides
homer
vergil
tibullus
catullus
pliny
and
aristophanes
only
by
hearsay
but
she
had
a
passion
for
trisyllables
of
latin
or
greek
derivation
was
she
perhaps
taking
desperate
measures
to
remedy
her
lack
of
a
classical
education
as
southern
poor
whites
sometimes
supplement
an
insufficient
diet
by
eating
clay
from
some
riverbank
but
if
she
did
not
know
titles
of
the
chief
works
of
every
well
known
contemporary
american
and
british
poet
novelist
and
critic
and
called
some
of
them
by
their
first
names
the
advanced
women
s
college
from
which
she
had
been
graduated
with
the
degree
of
bachelor
of
arts
had
apparently
kept
a
procession
of
famous
men
and
women
passing
through
its
student
lounges
he
sometimes
fancied
that
he
himself
was
only
cooling
his
heels
in
an
anteroom
dedicated
to
some
postgraduate
course
in
which
miss
golightly
was
enrolled
so
persistently
did
she
quiz
him
about
his
literary
acquaintance
what
she
was
after
of
course
was
what
women
like
her
were
always
after
the
artist
en
pantoufles
only
nowadays
they
were
nt
satisfied
to
have
him
served
up
en
pantoufles
they
wanted
him
in
the
buff
bough
she
would
probably
spell
it
sometimes
at
night
when
he
could
not
sleep
he
found
himself
writing
expository
prose
using
miss
golightly
s
spelling
and
locutions
she
had
confided
to
him
on
the
first
day
that
she
came
to
was
too
lazy
to
study
any
of
the
established
methods
and
too
vain
to
acknowledge
that
she
lacked
the
professional
equipment
for
her
job
he
had
told
bill
pettigrew
that
she
was
too
ignorant
to
discharge
the
duties
of
a
secretary
satisfactorily
bill
had
expressed
surprise
she
had
been
a
classmate
of
his
sister
s
at
gertrude
newman
s
he
said
and
had
graduated
summa
cum
laude
he
had
advised
claiborne
to
keep
her
you
might
get
a
girl
from
leonard
he
had
said
so
i
might
god
save
me
claiborne
had
returned
it
must
already
be
past
the
hour
during
the
last
few
min
utes
the
throng
of
people
pouring
out
onto
the
street
had
swelled
perceptibly
this
building
occupied
almost
half
of
a
city
block
and
thrust
the
blunt
tower
in
which
his
office
was
located
god
knew
how
many
feet
into
the
sky
high
enough
to
dwarf
the
figures
he
was
looking
down
on
almost
every
figure
hesitated
a
second
as
it
reached
the
threshold
of
the
building
as
so
fast
now
that
it
filled
the
whole
sidewalk
and
boomerang
on
the
dark
tide
to
amber
islands
in
the
wave
the
bow
of
the
boat
from
which
horne
had
dived
would
have
been
about
the
same
height
as
this
tower
in
which
he
himself
now
stood
and
horne
when
he
jumped
might
have
thought
of
himself
as
a
missile
which
would
return
to
the
hand
that
launched
it
there
had
been
an
interval
they
said
during
which
he
threshed
about
in
the
water
calling
for
help
but
there
had
been
no
return
and
no
amber
island
unless
you
call
the
belly
of
a
shark
an
island
the
captain
had
seen
two
of
them
closing
in
on
him
he
had
tried
to
talk
horne
out
of
boomerang
in
that
poem
having
no
formal
education
horne
never
scrupled
to
use
a
noun
for
a
verb
any
time
it
suited
him
having
that
much
at
least
in
common
with
miss
golightly
the
stream
was
sent
down
the
swift
hebrus
to
the
lesbian
shore
keep
that
gertrude
newman
stuff
up
long
enough
and
they
ll
make
lesbians
out
of
the
lot
of
them
but
it
was
nuns
who
were
rending
the
gory
visage
now
the
doings
doubtless
of
that
strange
large
woman
that
george
crenfew
s
flighty
young
wife
had
turned
into
odd
to
think
of
her
associating
with
nuns
or
not
so
odd
perhaps
in
the
old
days
she
had
always
been
off
on
some
mystic
quest
once
she
and
horne
and
joe
paster
had
kept
a
jarful
of
rainwater
sitting
around
the
studio
for
days
while
they
added
this
or
that
to
it
according
to
some
formula
of
black
magic
they
had
got
out
of
an
old
book
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
only
ten
minutes
past
four
if
he
left
the
office
now
he
still
had
time
to
go
down
to
mott
street
and
talk
to
that
nun
before
cynthia
would
expect
him
long
enough
to
knock
some
is
it
the
driver
said
claiborne
saw
a
three
story
house
that
many
years
ago
had
been
painted
white
between
the
house
and
the
curb
a
gray
unwieldy
serpent
crawled
unshaved
men
in
ragged
grimy
clothes
were
forming
a
line
around
the
corner
and
marching
up
to
the
old
mansion
it
had
a
stoop
a
little
elevated
above
the
street
the
soup
kitchen
was
evidently
located
in
the
basement
beneath
the
stoop
the
serpentine
line
flowed
steadily
until
it
came
abreast
of
the
stoop
when
it
wavered
and
coiled
back
upon
itself
before
it
slid
out
of
sight
down
the
steps
ever
since
claiborne
s
cab
had
pulled
up
at
the
curb
a
few
minutes
ago
the
men
had
been
shuffling
up
to
the
house
three
and
four
abreast
they
came
in
silence
for
the
most
part
and
most
of
them
looked
straight
ahead
as
they
walked
though
now
and
then
some
younger
man
whose
eyes
kept
roving
over
the
faces
of
his
companions
as
if
he
were
surprised
to
find
himself
among
them
emitting
a
short
laugh
say
something
in
a
low
voice
to
which
the
older
man
did
not
always
respond
there
was
one
man
who
had
attracted
claiborne
s
attention
when
he
first
came
in
sight
at
the
corner
a
tall
man
who
carried
himself
with
a
kind
of
jauntiness
or
was
it
only
that
he
moved
with
exaggerated
lightness
as
if
he
had
a
fearful
care
for
his
very
bones
he
was
neatly
dressed
in
a
dark
worn
suit
the
battered
gray
hat
that
rode
high
on
the
years
before
his
guinea
pig
pand
if
they
passed
a
horse
fallen
to
the
cobblestones
and
saw
the
driver
sweating
to
get
the
animal
to
its
feet
alexandre
would
boast
papa
could
get
that
horse
up
easily
more
likely
it
s
on
account
of
your
father
that
the
poor
beast
fell
his
mother
would
suggest
and
little
alexandre
would
agree
proudly
yes
papa
could
push
any
horse
over
papa
is
strong
none
of
this
childish
worship
incidentally
went
to
the
mother
and
why
should
it
mother
was
quite
different
mother
was
forever
washing
her
little
boy
combing
him
scolding
him
mother
would
say
stop
scuffing
your
shoes
do
you
day
or
else
blow
your
nose
what
will
people
think
when
they
see
a
boy
of
your
age
with
a
runny
nose
and
she
would
pin
a
big
square
piece
of
sheeting
to
his
blouse
there
now
you
ll
remember
i
hope
what
a
torture
that
rough
piece
of
cloth
was
screaming
to
everyone
i
m
a
little
boy
who
still
has
nt
sense
enough
to
blow
his
nose
when
it
runs
yes
that
was
mama
mama
forever
after
him
to
sit
up
straight
you
want
to
know
why
you
keep
having
those
ugly
coughs
well
let
me
tell
you
it
s
because
you
re
always
sitting
all
hunched
up
and
to
teach
him
to
hold
himself
properly
she
would
sew
to
the
inside
of
the
collar
of
all
his
blouses
a
little
button
and
whenever
she
looked
up
from
her
work
and
would
see
him
sitting
round
shouldered
she
d
say
button
button
and
that
was
the
out
his
chest
and
bring
his
neck
back
to
where
he
could
feel
the
button
ah
that
s
different
now
you
re
feeling
the
button
one
can
see
it
now
keep
feeling
it
how
different
life
was
when
papa
came
his
arms
were
full
of
bundles
wrapped
in
newspaper
bundles
which
he
would
drop
on
the
table
in
order
to
grab
up
his
boy
run
out
with
him
onto
the
landing
and
toss
him
high
up
in
the
air
up
we
go
up
like
a
balloon
his
mother
would
gasp
and
scream
because
there
on
the
land
ing
the
stairwell
yawned
ho
ho
silly
mama
is
nt
she
a
silly
to
think
that
we
re
going
to
let
our
boy
fall
down
those
steps
you
can
toss
him
in
the
room
not
high
enough
the
ceiling
is
too
low
in
the
room
must
you
toss
him
at
all
is
nt
he
getting
too
old
for
that
s
cheeks
when
she
was
aroused
as
long
as
these
arms
can
still
toss
dumas
would
say
i
m
going
to
toss
him
that
s
what
god
made
fathers
for
with
big
muscles
to
toss
their
children
he
gave
fathers
big
muscles
and
mothers
big
breasts
god
knew
what
he
was
doing
as
for
little
alexandre
he
was
never
frightened
by
the
yawning
steps
he
was
never
afraid
of
anything
when
his
father
was
around
only
when
he
was
with
his
mother
then
at
night
he
would
often
wake
up
out
of
his
sleep
and
scream
with
fear
after
the
tossing
came
the
examination
of
all
the
packages
that
papa
had
brought
oh
the
delight
of
opening
papa
s
packages
always
some
new
surprise
it
was
as
if
every
time
papa
came
to
visit
them
it
was
once
again
new
year
s
day
jour
d
etrennes
day
of
gifts
there
would
be
fruit
and
melons
and
a
cut
of
meat
or
fish
or
put
these
away
in
crocks
in
the
pantry
there
would
come
the
best
part
of
all
the
sweets
in
little
packages
wrapped
in
striped
or
colored
paper
sugared
plums
or
else
dragees
of
almonds
or
nougat
or
on
rare
occasions
delight
of
delights
rings
of
glaceed
pineapple
about
which
father
could
tell
stories
of
the
distant
tropics
where
pineapplesgrow
islands
that
rise
up
suddenly
out
of
a
warm
blue
sea
like
huge
green
gems
what
stories
papa
could
tell
of
men
in
prison
and
of
sailors
in
shipwrecks
and
of
the
time
he
had
gone
boar
hunting
and
the
boar
could
be
heard
grunting
deep
in
a
thicket
grunting
like
this
ugroink
ugr
groink
papa
could
imitate
every
kind
of
animal
and
then
of
how
fire
was
brought
down
from
heaven
and
of
the
girl
who
was
changed
into
a
tree
throughout
the
whole
of
his
first
six
or
seven
years
papa
s
stories
were
just
like
a
golden
haze
surrounding
little
alexandre
and
from
year
to
more
streams
of
enchanting
light
as
if
a
fairy
sun
were
rising
out
of
banks
of
fog
is
this
a
time
for
sweets
mama
would
exclaim
angrily
laying
her
hands
on
the
striped
paper
packages
why
he
did
nt
even
finish
his
soup
at
lunch
you
gave
me
too
much
soup
alexandre
would
cry
no
one
could
eat
so
much
soup
i
ll
be
judge
of
how
much
soup
a
little
boy
should
eat
his
mother
would
declare
with
mama
one
could
never
say
i
do
nt
like
this
or
that
you
had
to
finish
what
was
on
your
plate
let
him
have
at
least
one
taste
catherine
dumas
would
beg
little
alexandre
was
already
breaking
into
a
wail
but
his
father
secretly
nudged
him
and
gave
him
a
big
wink
while
mama
went
on
oh
well
if
you
re
going
to
take
charge
of
him
from
now
on
i
ve
like
but
be
prepared
to
hold
yourself
available
if
he
gets
sick
that
s
all
i
m
saying
and
while
they
were
arguing
papa
would
slip
little
alexandre
a
piece
of
candy
which
he
had
hidden
in
his
hand
catherine
darling
please
do
nt
flare
up
these
visits
to
see
the
two
of
you
are
my
moments
of
purest
joy
then
you
ve
nothing
to
do
but
make
your
joy
permanent
all
you
have
to
do
is
tell
your
mother
about
us
and
we
can
all
please
sweetheart
believe
me
we
will
yet
be
a
little
melora
actually
i
have
found
very
sweet
children
they
are
a
softly
modulated
voice
said
in
impeccable
english
the
three
heads
of
representative
janson
representative
smithfield
and
ensign
siegel
snapped
around
like
jerked
puppets
they
stared
in
horrified
disbelief
at
the
source
of
the
remark
which
was
the
girl
ensign
siegel
looking
at
the
girl
saw
some
of
his
quoted
guidebook
words
flash
across
his
mind
like
the
huge
illuminated
words
on
the
times
building
news
ticke
hancroid
yaws
gonorrhea
an
enormous
flood
of
embarrassment
engulfed
him
a
great
speechlessness
that
seemed
as
if
it
could
never
be
broken
seized
the
three
americans
madame
ensign
siegel
finally
managed
to
mumble
and
saw
a
smile
in
the
girl
s
eyes
at
the
word
i
am
ensign
siegel
of
the
united
states
navy
instantly
lie
realized
how
ridiculous
this
sounded
i
gathered
you
were
in
the
united
states
navy
the
girl
s
eyes
were
amused
above
her
how
do
you
do
she
said
politely
how
do
you
do
ensign
siegel
heard
himself
echo
then
he
said
in
weak
stuttering
tones
this
is
representative
janson
of
the
united
states
congress
and
representative
smithfield
of
the
united
states
congress
how
do
you
do
the
girl
said
with
flawless
manners
how
do
ma
am
representative
smithfield
said
jerkily
removing
his
panama
hat
pleased
to
meet
you
representative
janson
stuttered
removing
his
navy
hat
in
his
confusion
he
dropped
the
hat
he
stooped
and
scooped
it
up
fumblingly
it
s
a
real
pleasure
to
meet
you
the
honors
in
etiquette
were
all
on
the
side
of
the
girl
who
was
the
only
one
at
ease
the
congressmen
hurried
into
the
behavior
they
would
have
put
on
on
finding
out
suddenly
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
their
most
influential
constituent
we
re
honored
to
have
two
members
of

said
representative
smithfield
contritely
the
girl
smiled
pleasantly
both
sides
of
the
mason
dixon
line
she
said
this
is
an
honor
thank
you
indeed
representative
janson
said
respectfully
the
honor
is
all
ours
representative
smithfield
said
gallantly
the
girl
turned
easily
to
ensign
siegel
who
wished
he
could
find
some
place
to
go
into
the
ground
so
you
speak
tuluran
she
said
with
polite
interest
an
unusual
accomplishment
for
a
navy
officer
i
get
around
the
villages
siegel
heard
himself
explaining
this
sounded
stupid
in
his
ears
so
he
added
i
like
languages
that
he
felt
instantly
was
no
improvement
he
had
a
completely
frustrating
sensation
of
being
unable
to
be
anything
but
stupid
in
the
presence
of
this
girl
but
before
he
could
think
of
anything
further
to
say
she
turned
back
to
leave
this
pleasant
conversation
she
said
but
you
know
how
it
is
when
you
have
four
children
you
two
look
as
if
you
re
parents
yourselves
she
said
in
tones
of
sweet
inquiry
i
have
three
representative
janson
said
shamefacedly
i
have
five
representative
smithfield
admitted
avoiding
her
eyes
the
girl
turned
back
to
siegel
i
m
sorry
i
did
nt
have
my
children
all
four
of
them
along
for
you
to
meet
she
said
her
eyes
mischievous
they
are
such
sweet
children
i
m
sure
they
must
be
a
constant
source
of
amusement
to
you
ensign
siegel
said
impassively
i
have
enjoyed
them
very
much
she
said
after
a
quick
good
bye
in
tuluran
to
the
old
man
she
was
gone
the
two
congressmen
and
ensign
siegel
watched
in
silence
as
she
walked
lithely
down
the
road

sighed
where
the

the

sense

and
foresight
required
to
bring
this
off
called
for
a
wizardry
little
short
of
sublime
this
job
belonged
to
vice
admiral
d
d
boatwright
he
was
the
brains
of
the
pacific
war
it
was
his
genius
which
largely
planned
the
great
island
assaults
synchronized
a
million
men
and
the
education
of
admiral
boatwright
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
materiel
to
the
right
spot
at
the
right
minute
the
navy
had
furnished
admiral
boatwright
its
finest
education
and
it
found
in
him
a
veritable
naval
clausewitz
the
navy
had
taught
admiral
boatwright
just
about
everything
except
one
thing
before
pearl
harbor
reporters
seldom
treated
as
identified
enemy
agents
dedicated
to
filching
its
innermost
secrets
even
for
a
considerable
time
after
pearl
i
arbor
an
admiral
might
go
along
for
months
having
to
do
nothing
but
fight
the
war
and
never
encounter
a
reporter
but
by
the
beginning
of
the
navy
s
attitude
had
undergone
a
wondrous
change
the
navy
abruptly
falling
snatch
in
paris
one
of
the
first
i
ever
was
mixed
with
but
never
mind
it
now
thank
you
mr
moto
said
i
quite
agree
with
ruth
bogart
asked
am
i
going
with
you
or
not
certainly
not
jack
rhyce
said
quickly
there
wo
nt
be
any
need
ruth
if
he
does
nt
see
me
he
may
not
show
she
said
i
ve
known
it
to
happen
jack
as
things
stood
then
it
seemed
safe
to
discount
that
possibility
jack
was
actually
experiencing
a
feeling
which
was
almost
one
of
peace
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
japan
assignment
was
drawing
to
a
close
if
the
ending
was
not
wholly
satisfactory
it
was
effective
and
with
the
way
things
were
going
they
could
not
beat
about
the
bush
forever
his
main
mission
had
been
big
ben
he
took
the
blackjack
from
his
hip
pocket
tossed
it
in
the
air
and
caught
it
with
the
same
carelessness
he
would
have
caught
a
baseball
on
the
outside
it
was
very
nicely
constructed
the
japanese
were
always
good
at
detail
no
said
you
ll
only
be
in
the
way
if
there
s
any
kind
of
hassle
he
s
a
big
boy
and
he
may
muss
things
up
i
think
mr
rhyce
is
correct
mr
moto
said
i
am
most
grateful
to
you
miss
bogart
and
it
would
be
so
nice
if
i
could
pay
you
my
respects
when
this
is
over
perhaps
a
japanese
supper
tonight
but
ha
ha
not
at
the
cimaroon
and
just
with
me
and
mr
rhyce
but
ha
ha
not
with
mr
ben
at
then
mr
rhyce
and
thank
you
very
much
the
feeling
that
everything
was
over
still
persisted
after
mr
moto
had
gone
it
resembled
the
easing
of
tensions
he
had
experienced
before
when
a
job
was
almost
finished
and
everything
was
in
the
groove
but
this
time
elation
was
added
to
his
relief
which
he
tried
to
check
because
he
always
distrusted
elation
finally
his
conscience
troubled
him
with
a
nagging
suspicion
that
he
was
ending
things
might
to
an
ultimate
conclusion
it
was
true
that
he
was
hedging
his
bets
but
it
was
better
to
hedge
than
lose
and
they
were
winning
enough
at
least
they
were
crippling
the
apparatus
by
taking
out
big
ben
you
know
i
feel
pretty
good
on
the
whole
he
said
to
her
when
we
get
him
we
can
move
the
hell
out
of
here
and
head
for
home
her
expression
had
brightened
too
it
ca
nt
be
soon
enough
for
me
she
said
and
why
ca
nt
we
start
being
ourselves
when
we
get
on
that
plane
i
do
nt
see
why
we
ca
nt
from
there
on
in
he
answered
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
from
there
on
in
a
lot
of
things
he
said
and
we
ought
to
be
able
to
start
discussing
them
as
soon
as
i
get
back
here
do
you
mean
you
still
love
me
but
i
do
he
said
and
a
lot
of
other
things
come
to
think
of
it
i
would
nt
have
missed
any
of
this
even
being
unprofessional
she
asked
yes
he
said
even
being
unprofessional
jack
she
said
what
s
going
to
happen
to
him
he
s
not
our
problem
he
said
the
japs
will
take
him
over
but
it
s
the
best
we
could
do
under
the
circumstances
ruth
he
turned
and
strode
across
the
room
and
back
we
might
have
gone
further
into
this
if
bill
gibson
had
nt
died
but
i
think
it
s
time
now
to
stop
this
show
i
really
do
it
s
sticky
letting
the
japs
take
him
she
said
i
wish
you
and
i
were
nt
in
it
we
re
in
it
all
right
he
said
you
re
too
nice
for
am
too
i
would
nt
be
surprised
he
told
her
but
let
s
put
our
minds
on
pulling
out
of
here
tomorrow
ruth
the
interval
before
his
departure
for
the
cimaroon
always
remained
in
his
memory
as
a
domestic
sort
of
scene
i
do
nt
suppose
we
d
better
inquire
about
plane
reservations
yet
he
said
no
reason
for
anyone
to
know
that
we
re
checking
out
but
if
you
want
something
to
do
while
i
m
out
you
might
start
packing
your
suitcases
there
might
be
space
on
something
tomorrow
jack
she
said
do
nt
you
think
you
ought
to
wear
something
heavier
and
darker
than
that
seersucker
coat
oh
i
do
nt
think
so
he
answered
this
wo
nt
be
night
work
and
it
s
awfully
hot
outside
i
wish
you
were
carrying
a
gun
she
said
just
in
case
would
nt
you
like
to
borrow
my
fountain
m
going
to
need
it
i
can
do
fine
with
this
jack
he
said
he
was
feeling
almost
jovial
now
that
everything
was
set
i
m
really
pretty
good
at
controlling
one
of
these
i
think
you
ought
not
to
wear
crepe
soled
shoes
she
said
you
might
slip
in
them
i
do
nt
know
whether
you
ever
knew
bobby
burke
who
used
to
work
in
paris
he
slipped
making
apswing
at
oscar
ertz
you
know
the
czech
just
outside
the
gare
du
nord
he
skidded
on
the
pavement
and
had
a
shiv
in
him
before
he
could
recover
these
shoes
are
skid
proof
he
told
her
no
i
never
did
know
bob
but
i
ve
heard
plenty
about
him
ought
i
to
be
jealous
darling
she
said
i
never
knew
about
you
dear
and
you
never
knew
about
me
you
wo
nt
ever
need
to
be
jealous
now
let
handsome
so
do
you
he
said
it
was
time
to
be
going
but
he
did
not
want
to
leave
her
jack
she
said
if
you
do
hit
him
follow
through
let
him
have
it
all
he
s
an
awfully
big
man
you
know
now
you
d
better
kiss
me
good
by
i
do
nt
want
you
to
be
late
do
nt
forget
moto
s
coming
to
take
us
out
mess
the
risk
must
be
taken
it
s
my
duty
as
your
squire
to
bring
you
such
information
as
i
can
who
knows
this
great
goliath
may
have
certain
weaknesses
if
he
has
it
will
be
talked
about
where
the
squires
sit
down
to
meat
yes
master
rick
it
must
be
chanced
the
first
flush
of
dawn
was
in
the
sky
when
richard
wakened
he
had
the
room
to
himself
save
for
a
rustling
the
absence
of
his
squire
meant
trouble
something
slithered
by
on
the
slimy
floor
and
he
hastily
drew
his
feet
up
under
him
and
crouched
against
the
wall
having
no
liking
for
this
kind
of
visitor
further
reflection
brought
some
reassurance
if
tostig
s
activities
had
been
detected
he
himself
would
have
been
involved
in
the
consequences
by
this
time
his
mind
resumed
the
train
of
reflection
which
had
filled
it
during
his
last
waking
moments
he
repeated
every
scornful
word
spoken
by
the
princess
eleanor
he
carried
a
perfect
picture
of
her
in
his
mind
the
proud
tilt
of
her
golden
head
the
coldness
of
the
eye
she
had
fixed
upon
him
in
which
nonetheless
there
was
a
hint
of
tenderness
although
not
for
him
alas
the
delicate
modeling
of
her
nose
which
no
goldsmith
could
ever
hope
to
equal
the
ivory
perfection
of
her
hands
the
instinct
of
the
poet
which
was
latent
in
all
men
of
saxon
blood
wakened
in
him
my
great
and
lovely
lady
of
all
human
beings
but
the
more
desirable
for
that
you
are
like
the
red
gold
of
dawn
and
the
burning
sunshine
of
midday
but
also
you
are
the
quiet
blue
of
dusk
and
the
silver
path
that
the
moon
makes
in
the
silence
of
the
woods
you
can
be
like
the
storm
which
comes
out
of
an
angry
sky
but
to
those
you
deign
to
favor
you
are
the
rainbow
which
marks
its
end
your
loveliness
is
beyond
description
or
comparison
or
even
comprehension
he
paused
at
that
and
grinned
guiltily
in
the
darkness
truly
my
head
is
full
of
flummery
i
know
i
shall
never
see
this
beautiful
lady
again
this
angry
demoiselle
who
has
such
contempt
for
me
there
was
a
cautious
step
in
the
stone
hall
and
tostig
entered
the
room
he
carried
a
lighted
torch
which
he
fixed
in
an
iron
ring
on
the
wall
then
he
turned
and
regarded
richard
with
a
somber
eye
time
to
be
up
he
said
it
was
like
the
old
days
when
he
long
legs
and
ran
a
hand
through
his
tousled
hair
have
you
been
out
all
night
he
asked
i
drank
with
the
last
of
them
in
the
guardroom
then
i
came
back
and
had
a
few
hours
sleep
it
was
just
as
well
i
came
for
a
black
water
snake
was
curled
up
at
your
feet
an
hour
ago
i
went
out
again
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
a
grim
intentness
settled
over
the
squire
s
face
i
saw
your
opponent
last
night
he
sat
beside
the
cardinal
and
he
made
the
churchman
look
like
a
sly
little
red
squirrel
the
fellow
is
a
full
half
foot
taller
than
you
and
he
has
a
face
like
an
angry
grinning
owl
they
tell
me
his
horse
is
an
enormous
black
what
were
they
saying
in
the
guardroom
you
should
have
heard
how
they
laughed
last
night
thinking
what
their
man
would
do
to
you
such
cackling
and
blowing
off
and
a
hulking
codshead
and
i
rolled
him
in
a
muck
heap
they
are
all
certain
he
ll
win
huh
the
slutching
fools
are
sure
you
ll
he
spitted
like
a
gamecock
and
carried
off
the
field
in
pieces
he
came
to
a
halt
beside
the
pile
of
rushes
and
stared
at
his
master
for
although
a
free
man
he
still
thought
no
other
term
proper
there
s
one
chance
master
richard
if
you
try
for
his
shield
you
ll
think
you
have
come
dead
on
against
an
iron
mountain
on
hoofs
you
must
aim
for
the
visor
i
sat
for
hours
listening
to
the
jabber
of
these
country
fools
and
i
found
out
one
thing
no
one
has
ever
tried
for
the
visor
because
he
sits
so
high
above
them
he
ll
be
taken
by
surprise
you
must
contrive
to
hit
him
high
and
hard
one
chance
only
in
ten
that
i
could
do
it
declared
richard
getting
to
his
feet
and
like
aiming
at
the
moon
i
tell
you
it
s
the
only
way
said
the
squire
earnestly
he
s
as
slowwitted
as
a
bull
if
you
seem
to
be
aiming
for
his
shield
and
do
nt
swing
your
lance
upward
until
the
last
moment
he
ll
be
taken
so
much
by
surprise
that
you
may
scoop
him
right
out
of
his
saddle
i
must
win
i
must
declared
richard
passionately
she
must
keep
that
much
memory
of
me
at
least
yes
you
must
win
and
a
little
practice
before
anyone
rubs
the
sleep
out
of
his
eyes
will
be
useful
there
s
a
quintain
behind
the
seats
i
ll
raise
it
to
allow
for
the
extra
height
in
the
saddle
the
spot
to
strike
is
where
the
visor
is
attached
to
the
helm
if
you
get
him
there
he
ll
take
the
impact
of
it
on
his
forehead
it
will
unsettle
his
wits
if
it
does
nothing
else
and
he
ll
go
into
the
tostig
was
talking
in
this
vein
to
strengthen
the
young
knight
s
confidence
both
of
them
knew
that
the
giant
would
come
down
the
course
like
a
black
wind
trussed
in
steel
like
the
high
waves
of
an
angry
sea
only
by
the
greatest
skill
could
such
sheer
brute
strength
be
met
and
sustained
fetch
messire
out
said
richard
and
i
ll
practice
at
the
quintain
i
m
sure
you
are
right
this
is
my
only
chance
tostig
returned
messire
to
his
stall
and
then
joined
richard
in
the
room
under
the
moat
the
latter
was
still
himself
set
a
term
to
their
labor
he
began
to
question
the
men
on
the
line
with
him
one
after
another
to
find
out
how
many
of
them
felt
as
he
did
about
what
they
were
doing
for
a
living
more
sure
of
himself
with
every
passing
hour
he
moved
up
and
down
the
line
demanding
whenever
there
was
a
moment
an
answer
to
his
insistent
question
do
you
think
anybody
likes
coming
in
here
to
work
everybody
does
one
day
a
week
payday
said
the
solder
flower
not
even
the
bosses
said
the
deck
fitter
do
you
think
anybody
with
sense
would
knock
himself
out
in
this
dirt
and
noise
if
it
was
nt
for
the
money
and
the
this
kind
of
work
is
it
s
colored
man
s
work
but
even
the
colored
men
are
smartening
up
they
turn
up
their
noses
at
it
too
unless
they
get
strapped
saddened
and
bewildered
by
this
last
comment
walter
turned
away
from
the
man
who
had
made
it
and
who
had
punctuated
his
bitter
remark
with
a
series
of
thunderous
blows
on
a
door
that
he
was
fitting
only
orrin
the
second
metal
finisher
grudgingly
admitted
that
the
work
was
a
challenge
to
him
that
the
pay
was
fair
and
that
there
were
worse
jobs
behind
them
all
long
jawed
joe
caught
up
with
his
work
as
usual
stood
casually
beveling
his
screwdriver
i
hear
you
ve
been
taking
a
little
poll
he
said
to
walter
what
s
it
to
you
walter
asked
truculently
he
was
in
no
mood
to
be
mocked
with
apparent
irrelevance
joe
replied
by
demanding
how
come
you
fixed
on
being
an
engineer
walter
was
taken
aback
is
that
s
not
reason
enough
for
a
fellow
to
struggle
and
sweat
to
get
to
college
damn
it
does
nt
anybody
go
out
and
do
what
he
wants
to
any
more
i
m
not
saying
you
would
nt
make
a
good
engineer
or
that
it
would
nt
be
fine
for
a
change
to
have
some
engineers
who
care
as
much
about
people
as
they
do
about
gadgets
but
supposing
you
find
out
after
you
get
to
college
that
you
want
to
spend
your
time
learning
something
useless
are
you
going
to
leave
yourself
open
for
it
boy
you
sure
are
free
with
advice
joe
looked
at
him
gravely
his
long
sad
jaw
had
the
hint
of
a
smile
the
men
on
the
line
like
you
walter
they
do
nt
think
you
re
just
nosy
when
you
ask
questions
they
think
you
re
one
of
them
and
in
a
good
way
you
are
maybe
that
s
why
i
ve
got
hopes
for
you
walter
fought
hard
against
subversive
outlook
was
so
foreign
to
everything
walter
had
been
taught
but
he
was
forced
to
admit
to
himself
that
more
and
more
he
was
seeing
the
factory
through
joe
s
cold
discerning
eyes
and
he
began
to
fear
that
if
joe
were
ever
to
leave
the
plant
would
have
no
real
existence
other
than
as
a
money
producing
nightmare
not
only
was
there
no
one
else
really
to
talk
to
about
it
but
joe
had
forced
walter
to
try
to
formulate
his
emerging
ideas
in
an
adult
and
comprehensible
way
the
worst
thing
about
the
assembly
line
is
what
it
does
to
your
self
respect
he
said
to
joe
early
one
morning
as
they
squatted
on
their
haunches
waiting
for
the
starting
siren
it
s
hard
to
keep
from
feeling
like
a
fool
when
you
know
that
everybody
looks
down
on
what
you
re
doing
even
the
men
who
are
doing
it
themselves
joe
hung
his
hammer
and
metal
spoon
from
the
brass
hook
at
his
belt
the
big
pitch
has
always
been
that
we
repa
impractical
european
dreamers
that
production
can
serve
people
but
instead
people
are
serving
production
look
how
frightened
how
hysterical
the
bosses
get
when
the
line
stops
they
ca
nt
afford
to
figure
what
it
costs
you
to
keep
it
moving
they
only
know
they
ve
got
a
production
quota
of
course
when
sales
resistance
starts
building
up
and
they
put
the
cork
back
in
themselves
they
give
you
just
the
opposite
story
who
can
blame
the
poor
slob
in
the
middle
for
suspecting
that
the
whole
setup
is
really
as
nutty
as
a
fruitcake
and
for
feeling
ashamed
of
himself
for
being
caught
up
in
it
all
right
walter
challenged
him
who
s
crazy
you
me
the
guys
around
us
or
the
board
of
directors
anybody
who
gets
suckered
into
believing
that
there
s
anything
real
behind
the
billboards
they
put
up
to
get
the
show
on
the
road
so
that
he
commits
himself
to
buying
the
billboard
pictures
by
selling
his
life
on
the
installment
plan
that
the
whole
world
is
against
him
that
he
s
the
victim
of
a
huge
conspiracy
organized
to
make
his
car
fall
apart
before
it
s
been
paid
off
does
nt
life
in
the
factory
seem
to
be
deliberately
designed
to
lower
your
own
self
esteem
what
happens
when
you
re
knocking
down
a
dent
if
you
rap
it
too
hard
from
the
inside
you
have
to
file
it
down
that
much
more
and
you
hate
yourself
for
it
if
you
do
nt
rap
it
hard
enough
you
only
find
out
after
it
s
moved
on
down
the
line
and
then
you
have
to
hurry
up
and
wallop
it
again
in
either
case
you
hate
yourself
instead
of
hating
the
car
or
the
invisible
man
that
started
up
the
line
he
laughed
briefly
in
anticipation
of
what
he
was
about
to
add
it
s
like
the
man
that
hits
his
thumb
with
a
hammer
while
he
s
hanging
a
picture
only
here
he
keeps
hitting
his
thumb
because
they
re
moving
the
wall
as
fast
as
the
union
will
let
ball
peen
comes
down
on
his
nail
himself
i
wonder
walter
said
slowly
how
many
people
actually
feel
that
way
more
than
you
can
count
it
s
always
was
only
a
matter
of
time
oh
relax
it
s
not
anything
like
that
it
s
just
emotional
rally
round
glory
be
to
god
breathed
isaac
his
color
returning
well
it
s
nothing
to
celebrate
said
comfort
resentfully
i
mean
this
thing
has
really
got
me
bugged
bugged
said
isaac
is
i
think
not
an
unusual
condition
for
you
not
this
bugged
she
insisted
daddy
o
listen
something
weird
has
happened
all
of
a
sudden
i
like
boys
i
do
nt
just
like
em
i
mean
i
go
ape
when
i
think
said
isaac
and
when
did
this
trans
formation
take
place
i
do
nt
know
three
or
four
weeks
ago
i
guess
i
first
noticed
it
the
night
grady
metcalf
came
around
with
his
motorcycle
you
see
his
fossils
promised
him
a
motorcycle
on
his
eighteenth
birth
day
if
he
passed
math
and
by
fossils
interrupted
isaac
i
presume
you
mean
parents
what
else
said
comfort
well
anyhow
excuse
me
said
isaac
interrupting
again
am
i
to
understand
that
grady
metcalf
passed
math
weirdsville
ai
nt
it
said
comfort
it
is
indeed
he
agreed
yeh
said
comfort
well
anyhow
grady
met
calf
who
is
one
of
the
really
big
meatballs
of
our
generation
and
i
hate
him
like
poison
he
took
me
out
riding
on
his
motorcycle
and
you
know
what
all
of
a
sudden
he
did
know
what
else
when
i
saw
him
in
school
the
next
day
he
looked
even
better
weirdsville
said
isaac
solemnly
but
that
s
not
the
worst
of
it
cried
comfort
all
the
boys
looked
good
to
me
i
mean
i
went
down
the
hall
and
saw
twerps
and
gropers
that
i
would
just
as
soon
step
on
em
as
look
at
em
and
suddenly
they
did
nt
seem
so
bad
after
all
in
fact
lately
there
s
not
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
boys
in
the
whole
school
that
i
ca
nt
stand
tell
me
said
isaac
nervously
this
new
outlook
of
yours
has
it
made
you
shall
we
say
more
tractable
oh
do
nt
worry
daddy
o
i
have
nt
done
anything
they
still
call
me
the
iron
maiden
at
school
but
i
ll
tell
you
the
truth
daddy
o
when
i
cope
these
days
my
heart
is
nt
really
in
to
cope
asked
isaac
hopefully
i
do
sighed
comfort
but
it
seems
less
important
all
the
time
and
that
s
what
bugs
me
daddy
o
why
do
i
feel
this
way
isaac
was
suddenly
touched
to
the
depths
of
his
craggy
heart
he
rose
from
his
desk
walked
over
to
comfort
and
laid
an
awkward
hand
on
her
shoulder
comfort
child
he
said
softly
if
the
good
lord
in
his
wisdom
had
not
seen
fit
to
take
your
mother
perhaps
she
could
answer
you
all
i
can
say
is
no
matter
how
bewildering
it
all
seems
it
is
quite
natural
and
soon
everything
will
be
in
order
again
grand
said
comfort
unhappily
what
do
i
do
in
the
meantime
in
the
meantime
answered
isaac
you
ve
got
rally
round
three
hundred
years
of
puritan
blood
in
your
veins
listen
to
it
the
putnam
s
landing
chapter
of
the
dean
presleyschool
fatso
s
diner
here
starting
at
seven
in
the
evening
they
would
stand
beside
their
hybrid
automobiles
tilt
their
pelvises
hug
their
elbows
smoke
cigarettes
tell
lies
about
their
sex
life
and
spit
after
a
while
they
would
go
inside
the
diner
drink
cokes
lean
on
the
juke
box
and
play
fats
domino
the
clef
tones
and
of
course
elvis
toward
midnight
they
would
go
home
where
during
their
absence
their
fathers
and
mothers
had
been
arguing
violently
each
mother
contending
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
boy
he
was
just
passing
through
a
phase
and
each
father
insisting
that
a
good
belt
on
the
side
of
the
head
would
send
him
through
the
phase
a
hell
of
a
lot
faster
as
the
boy
slouched
into
the
house
the
mother
would
approach
him
with
a
sweet
propitiatory
smile
and
say
would
you
like
a
glass
of
milk
before
you
go
to
bed
dear
by
way
of
reply
he
would
snarl
and
lurch
up
to
his
bedroom
while
the
mother
bodily
prevented
the
father
from
going
after
him
and
fracturing
his
skull
thus
passed
a
typical
evening
of
a
typical
new
delinquent
spitting
loitering
and
addling
his
parents
no
gas
stations
got
held
up
no
stores
got
burgled
no
citizens
got
mugged
no
blood
got
spilled
and
no
girls
got
ruined
the
sex
life
of
the
new
the
flag
boys
delinquent
was
wholly
conversational
on
week
nights
they
had
no
dates
at
all
on
fridays
and
saturdays
they
drove
the
local
girls
to
dark
places
and
made
out
making
out
was
nothing
more
than
what
used
to
be
called
necking
or
petting
this
activity
as
older
readers
will
recall
covered
a
good
deal
of
territory
but
always
stopped
short
of
fulfillment
the
new
delinquents
were
in
their
hearts
as
scared
of
real
sex
as
they
were
of
real
larceny
now
on
this
night
while
comfort
good
pasture
was
having
a
heart
to
heart
talk
with
her
father
four
new
delinquents
were
parking
lot
of
fatso
s
diner
each
wore
a
ducktail
haircut
and
long
greasy
sideburns
each
held
a
king
size
cigarette
in
his
mouth
each
was
seventeen
years
old
they
stood
this
quartet
of
rebels
without
causes
these
victims
of
the
zeitgeist
and
made
the
following
conversation
what
s
the
scoop
for
tonight
said
the
one
called

remember
when
my
old
lady
took
me
to
a
time
we
will
never
forget
it
was
what
the
russians
called
a
nagan
a
cheaply
made
capgun
affair
but
schild
accepted
it
reverently
and
though
he
detested
firearms
gave
an
earnest
imitation
of
lichenko
s
ecstasy
over
the
colt
you
agree
you
will
exchange
shouted
lichenko
my
dear
friend
i
salute
you
on
his
feet
he
highballed
with
the
right
hand
a
dwarf
against
the
bas
relief
of
the
large
americans
who
had
started
to
surge
genially
upon
him
through
the
dismembered
furniture
schild
was
rising
in
honor
of
the
moment
at
the
very
least
to
return
the
salute
when
lichenko
began
to
discharge
the
he
salute
to
fortune
but
the
kick
from
the
one
convulsed
his
hand
into
another
and
he
was
drawn
nolens
volens
into
a
full
tribute
below
the
scored
ceiling
and
within
the
vermiculated
walls
lichenko
now
spent
gun
drooping
sniffed
the
atmosphere
of
powder
appeared
about
to
sneeze
did
not
and
pushed
a
reproachful
lower
lip
like
a
coal
chute
at
schild
ah
my
friend
this
american
pistol
he
tore
at
his
choker
collar
excuse
me
vasya
is
ill
pand
fell
prone
into
the
plaster
which
of
course
was
now
the
common
ground
you
win
the
medal
said
lieutenant
leek
an
unjolly
snowman
to
schild
he
blew
clean
his
glasses
and
inquired
silently
with
blurred
vision
for
number
one
horse
s
ass
berlin
district
nader
touched
schild
s
elbow
and
whispered
look
jack
lovett
went
for
the
mps
get
your
ass
hole
buddy
out
of
here
we
ll
con
them
he
fingered
back
an
eyelid
peered
at
the
red
orb
drunk
as
a
skunk
he
ordered
corporal
reinhart
to
lend
a
hand
reinhart
lifted
lichenko
by
the
belt
and
pulled
him
over
a
shoulder
veronica
why
do
nt
you
go
along
asked
nader
jesus
maybe
he
s
dead
o
k
thanks
for
the
party
said
she
i
had
a
lovely
time
anyhow
reinhart
navigated
through
the
rear
door
and
into
the
garden
already
military
police
sirens
sounded
in
the
distance
through
the
back
yards
having
trouble
at
every
sonbitching
fence
and
around
the
block
to
schild
s
house
was
their
silent
way
reinhart
scalves
were
tired
on
the
stairs
but
he
gripped
the
banister
and
made
it
in
good
shape
to
the
room
where
as
his
burden
was
lowered
to
the
bed
it
came
to
life
briefly
displaying
a
revolving
eye
and
returned
to
dreamland
with
a
mouthful
of
bedspread
veronica
examined
the
body
from
a
distance
found
it
hale
sir
to
do
this
for
that
russian
if
his
army
found
out
about
it
he
d
be
headed
for
siberia
and
very
seconded
that
i
think
said
schild
the
american
army
is
what
we
have
to
worry
about
at
the
moment
he
took
a
tiny
package
from
his
pocket
can
you
use
these
anybody
who
ever
opened
a
k
ration
had
fleetwood
cigarettes
to
dispose
of
yet
reinhart
was
sure
these
were
his
own
come
home
he
was
too
weary
the
evening
had
been
too
extravagant
to
inquire
by
what
route
new
relations
consisting
so
fiercely
in
the
precise
time
of
day
and
the
specific
mise
en
scene
the
sudden
dislocation
of
these
threw
both
very
and
reinhart
into
a
diffidence
especially
now
as
their
task
ended
they
went
out
of
step
down
the
sidewalk
to
very
s
house
from
the
side
of
his
eye
reinhart
could
see
her
shoulder
bag
swinging
off
the
divisions
of
silence
an
occasional
officer
or
nurse
not
breaking
from
the
party
down
the
street
its
siren
dying
like
a
throttled
pussycat
another
mp
jeep
arrived
at
her
door
reinhart
chickened
out
of
trying
for
a
good
night
kiss
perhaps
with
a
view
towards
establishing
his
independence
which
in
the
pale
simulacrum
of
post
coitum
tristis
that
was
his
after
party
letdown
he
felt
had
been
compromised
or
perhaps
it
was
a
defense
against
the
progressive
frigidity
she
gave
off
as
they
approached
the
front
step
oh
this
is
where
you
live
he
asked
numbly
haha
were
you
going
to
charge
me
with
breaking
and
en
tering
this
cruel
parody
of
his
own
earlier
fantasies
on
the
mansion
of
her
person
despite
the
false
laughter
whose
spuriousness
was
advertised
by
its
miraculous
lack
of
resonance
it
was
as
if
a
great
bell
rang
so
shallowly
that
nothing
trembled
suddenly
elicited
his
overdue
response
to
lichenko
s
rampage
to
assault
an
entity
of
order
to
register
a
spontaneous
nay
against
the
sanctioned
and
authorized
mean
but
it
very
skipped
insouciantly
inside
the
doorway
shortly
her
other
end
appeared
saying
see
you
in
the
funny
papers
captain
st
george
s
surprise
was
limited
he
had
rapped
at
and
opened
schild
s
door
on
his
regular
schedule
of
unnecessary
morning
information
the
bath
is
free
and
looked
upon
a
scrawny
alien
fundament
lichenko
rump
to
door
was
bent
in
a
study
of
his
big
toe
schild
s
guest
had
awakened
with
a
refusal
to
recognize
his
benefactor
something
schild
however
took
in
good
grace
and
did
not
sully
with
a
word
as
the
russian
scratched
an
elusive
cap
a
pie
itch
lip
farted
at
his
own
image
in
the
mirror
and
spat
a
long
drizzle
of
saliva
out
the
window
in
droll
reproof
of
the
sunlight
that
made
him
wince
then
he
turned
said
with
ill
humor
da
and
undressed
for
an
examination
of
his
pelt
st
george
recovered
with
expedition
i
thought
you
had
a
woman
in
here
he
chortled
to
had
been
his
bed
arising
with
the
aid
of
the
dresser
corner
khaki
undershirt
and
shorts
clinging
to
him
like
old
crepe
paper
sallow
hairy
shivering
berlin
sair
in
the
shadows
stayed
cold
till
noon
schild
said
as
st
george
averted
his
eyes
so
what
else
is
new
he
watched
the
dull
pain
fill
the
captain
s
eyelids
distend
his
cheeks
sag
the
loose
mouth
and
lower
the
chin
going
down
like
mercury
in
a
chill
it
was
a
kind
of
crying
just
beneath
the
epidermis
years
of
it
had
now
sure
he
said
we
ai
nt
that
hard
up
for
money
what
we
do
what
we
do
he
mimicked
see
what
going
on
go
to
a
movie
he
was
on
his
feet
he
flipped
a
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head

it
now

down
to
the
grocery
and
bought
a
small
pack
of
tea
bags
julius
arcenaux
put
them
in
a
little
paper
bag
and
rang
up

cash
register

said

julius
grinned
nobody

tea
unless

had
a
good
smile
she
thought
very
gay
and
his
reputation
as

thought
well

her
but

west
julius
said

a
pair
of
field
glasses
and
he
would
often
watch
the
boats
to
see

put
over
their
nets
or
to
see
what
direction

she
went

walked
around

living
room

much
furniture

thought
claudie

so
long
i
do

they
tugged
the
two
chairs
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
she
pulling
and
claudie
pushing
now
she
said
she
stopped
to
drink
the
tea
claudie
dropped
down
on
the
floor
and
panted
pretending
to
be
a
dog
lolling
his
head
from
side
to
side
she
grinned
at
him
at
first
and
then
the
smile
faded
off
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
but
went
crawling
around
on
his
hands
and
knees
growling
and
panting
you
going
to
want
to
get
married
she
said
not
so
much
to
him
as
to
herself
one
of
these
days
if
i
am
alive
to
see
it
and
no

he
looked
over
at
her
and
began
to
bark
you
not
going
to
go
sneaking
around
you
hear
he
threw
back
his
head
and
howled
the
long
hunting
howl
quit
she
put
the
teacup
on
back
to
work
perique
slammed
out
of
the
store
you

julius
shouted
after

you
said

and
perique
turned
and
threw
the
piece
of
metal
julius
caught
it
and
held
it
up
between
his
two
fingers
looking
at
it
that
what
it
is
for
sure
he
said
perique

he
sighed
and
went
back
in
the
store
he
put
the
bolt
down
on
a
shelf
carefully
perique

be
back
for
it
maybe
julius
thought
if

had
time

be
a
good
thing
to
do
everybody
was
so
nervous
they
d
all
be
having
strokes
if
they
did
nt
calm
down
he
sat
down
and
turned
on
the
radio
he
d
have
to
remember
to
pull
closed
the
heavy
shutters
on
mood
like
that
there
were
liable
to
be
fights
and
the
store
windows
might
get
broke
just
for
fun
it
had
happened
before
smashed
both
windows
just
to
get
a
couple
of
packs
of
cigarettes
left
the
money
on
the
counter
it
was
a
penny
short
too
he
d
close
those
shutters
annie
came
home
in
the
late
afternoon
adele
found
her
in
the
middle
of
the
living
room
i
did
nt
hear
you
adele
said
i
got
a
start
i
forgot
annie
said
you
gab
gab
but
now
i
want
to
know
what
rowland
s
going
to
be
like
and
being
his
grandmother
i
can
think
about
that
without
having
the
work
and
responsibilities
of
raising
him
that
s
it
you
re
so
busy
raising
your
children
and
so
much
a
part
of
their
lives
that
you
do
nt
really
give
much
thought
to
their
future
i
do
nt
want
to
embarrass
you
you
do
nt
embarrass
me
said
mary
wait
till
i
tell
you
i
do
nt
want
to
even
ask
you
to
come
to
see
me
because
that
must
be
that
takes
an
effort
but
i
hope
i
sincerely
hope
that
to
somebody
that
you
want
to
talk
to
somebody
other
than
your
mother
just
remember
me
there
s
one
good
thing
about
my
awful
life
mary
i
ve
had
the
experience
why
do
you
say
that
what
experience
oh
mary
we
know
do
i
have
to
say
it
in
so
many
words
i
knew
the
first
day
you
looked
at
me
alfred
had
told
you
about
me
alfred
is
so
honorable
that
he
d
feel
he
had
to
tell
you
that
his
mother
had
been
an
unfaithful
wife
well
i
was
of
course
i
was
i
know
i
m
not
pretending
i
did
nt
know
that
part
of
it
but
why
are
you
saying
all
this
now
for
the
future
if
i
d
had
anyone
to
talk
to
well
things
probably
would
have
turned
out
the
same
way
but
maybe
just
maybe
having
someone
to
talk
to
would
have
no
maybe
not
no
different
from
my
second
i
was
thinking
that
the
second
one
could
have
been
prevented
but
i
guess
not
no
i
do
nt
think
so
is
what
you
mean
that
i
might
want
to
have
a
love
affair
that
s
simply
never
going
to
happen
and
i
must
say
mrs
eaton
i
ca
nt
say
i
like
your
thinking
it
might
happen
it
s
because
i
do
nt
want
it
to
happen
said
martha
no
i
do
nt
believe
you
you
think
it
is
going
to
happen
i
do
nt
say
you
want
it
to
happen
but
you
re
convinced
it
will
in
fact
listening
to
you
i
got
the
feeling
that
you
thought
it
had
happened
or
was
happening
now
no
mary
i
do
nt
think
it
has
happened
or
is
now
but
when
i
married
alfred
s
father
i
did
nt
even
know
it
ever
happened
and
not
many
years
later
it
happened
to
me
that
because
when
it
happened
mary
the
man
was
just
as
innocent
or
ignorant
as
i
was
he
had
never
been
in
love
with
anyone
but
his
wife
it
s
people
like
us
innocent
ignorant
people
that
it
does
happen
to
a
friendship
and
he
s
nice
when
you
need
someone
and
before
you
know
it
you
ca
nt
stand
to
be
separated
and
with
married
people
it
is
nt
like
a
boy
and
a
girl
who
are
nt
married
with
married
people
there
s
only
one
ending
no
there
is
nt
there
are
two
endings
you
put
a
stop
to
it
as
i
did
i
did
too
then
you
were
lucky
and
strong
whether
i
was
lucky
or
strong
i
put
a
stop
to
it
before
it
ended
the
way
you
think
it
has
to
and
i
always
will
and
i
expect
alfred
to
do
the
same
thing
then
you
re
both
lucky
and
both
does
he
know
about
the
danger
of
course
we
do
nt
see
so
many
people
and
it
was
nt
lex
porter
so
do
nt
imagine
things
there
i
m
glad
you
put
a
stop
to
it
and
grateful
glad
for
you
and
grateful
for
alfred
you
re
right
i
did
think
it
was
lex
porter
well
it
was
nt
lex
could
be
a
heart
breaker
not
my
heart
lex
only
appeals
to
a
certain
ty
mary
changed
her
speech
i
do
nt
think
of
lex
that
way
he
only
appeals
to
a
certain
type
of
woman
said
martha
she
smiled
i
guess
he
does
and
i
guess
i
have
nothing
to
worry
about
i
was
nt
classifying
you
with
lex
s
girls
mrs
eaton
why
not
ca
nt
we
talk
about
something
else
yes
that
s
the
trouble
with
not
seeing
to
see
me
it
s
an
event
in
my
life
and
i
forget
that
they
re
seeing
people
and
making
polite
conversation
all
the
time
i
have
nt
people
any
more
i
have
servants
and
whatever
birds
and
animals
i
can
look
out
at
some
women
like
to
read
but
i
doze
off
i
d
like
to
meet
mr
galsworthy
john
galsworthy
the
english
author
he
would
have
been
on
my
side
and
i
read
a
book
by
a
woman
edith
wharton
but
most
writers
have
a
tendency
to
gloss
over
things
oh
well
most
people
do
too
i
think
about
the
lives
of
the
people
i
ve
known
some
of
them
pretty
interesting
but
nobody
d
ever
put
them
in
a
book
because
everybody
has
that
tendency
to
gloss
over
things
nobody
d
ever
put
george
fry
s
life
into
a
book
just
a
coach
man
finally
burned
to
death
in
a
fire
and
yet
it
was
an
unusual
life
if
you
knew
the
facts
my
miss
trimingham
would
rather
read
what
she
s
reading
i
now
the
sheik
have
you
read
the
sheik
mary
yes
did
you
like
it
i
have
nt
read
it
i
would
nt
even
know
about
it
if
miss
trimingham
had
nt
tucked
it
behind
a
pillow
out
of
my
sight
was
it
naughty
well
parts
of
it
i
guess
it
never
really
tells
anything
in
so
many
words
i
guess
they
would
nt
be
allowed
to
sell
it
if
they
did
but
it
never
could
have
happened
at
least
i
did
nt
believe
it
it
was
written
by
a
woman
the
author
is
really
a
woman
uses
initials
instead
of
her
first
name
ethel
m
dell
no
they
said
one
of
the
best
in
the
whole
country
engineering
agriculture
and
i
do
nt
know
it
s
a
kind
of
a
free
feeling
what
i
like
there
s
nothing
coming
at
you
know
what
i
mean
it
s
busy
but
it
s
quiet
no
dodging
the
fishing
is
great
and
hunting
boy
is
this
the
happy
hunting
ground
moose
and
bear
browns
thirteen
feet
high
on
their
hind
legs
and
polar
bears
their
hide
would
cover
the
whole
floor
of
this
room
i
m
going
to
get
me
a
bear
if
ai
nt
going
to
be
the
last
they
came
unbelievably
from
california
and
from
oregon
and
nebraska
and
illinois
and
the
carolinas
they
never
talked
of
the
war
you
would
not
have
known
they
had
been
snowflakes
if
you
had
not
seen
in
their
young
faces
certain
deeply
etched
lines
which
ordinarily
are
found
only
in
old
faces
they
added
fresh
life
to
the
town
of
baranof
some
of
them
stayed
and
became
alaskans
and
bred
alaskans
army
bases
ringed
the
town
gay
hued
private
cars
and
drab
army
cars
and
trucks
swarmed
the
pavements
and
pretty
young
mothers
and
vigorous
young
men
and
perambulators
and
strollers
and
toddlers
imparted
to
gold
street
a
virility
that
hit
you
with
the
impact
of
a
blow
perhaps
bridie
s
maternalism
stemmed
from
those
days
when
she
a
young
frightened
homesick
girl
had
come
to
baranof
alone
and
lonely
she
knew
and
understood
about
some
of
those
men
scarcely
more
than
boys
surrounded
by
thousands
at
close
quarters
at
morgensternor
kinkaid
air
bases
who
on
leave
they
washed
shaved
dressed
with
extra
care
boots
were
shined
uniform
brushed
they
lounged
around
baranof
s
gold
street
they
dropped
in
at
the
juke
box
joints
they
slipped
coins
in
the
slot
to
be
lulled
or
soothed
by
the
tranquilizer
artificial
music
a
mechanical
sound
hammered
out
you
re
a
livin
doll
or
the
whining
self
pitying
ballads
of
the
day
why
did
you
leave
me
was
it
to
grieve
me
you
in
my
arms
you
have
those
charms
they
sat
in
the
uso
big
room
listlessly
reading
an
outside
newspaper
a
week
old
the
colored
boys
huddled
in
a
corner
watching
tv
you
rarely
saw
them
standing
on
a
street
corner
these
boys
surveying
a
passing
alaska
world
in
the
dim
cold
calling
out
an
unconvincing
and
unconvinced
hello
gorgeous
to
a
bearlike
female
figure
so
muffled
in
hood
parka
mukluks
mittens
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
she
mingle
with
the
ground
or
very
rarely
you
did
not
see
air
wives
shopping
in
baranof
they
lived
an
intensely
concentrated
social
life
on
the
vast
base
as
did
their
martial
male
mates
the
women
belonged
to
clubs
on
the
bases
they
attended
teas
cocktail
parties
dances
movies
their
children
went
to
base
schools
pas
bridle
put
it
somewhat
sniffily
for
her
air
does
nt
mingle
with
us
peasants
but
those
kids
those
boys
around
they
kill
me
the
look
on
them
the
girls
began
to
arrive
from
everywhere
again
they
were
following
the
men
into
alaska
but
they
were
not
at
all
like
those
girls
who
had
come
at
the
turn
of
the
century
they
looked
terribly
young
in
the
inadequate
pale
blue
coat
and
the
little
high
heeled
pumps
hatless
the
pretty
dress
belling
out
over
the
bouffant
nylon
petticoat
as
they
stepped
off
the
plane
into
the
icy
airport
no
one
in
baranof
quite
knew
how
bridle
ballantyne
had
become
unofficial
welcomer
chaperone
these
girls
who
suddenly
prim
and
apprehensive
descended
out
of
the
air
into
the
waiting
arms
of
an
equally
stiff
apprehensive
young
man
in
air
force
uniform
or
in
parka
and
mukluks
everyone
in
baranof
knew
bridie
so
perhaps
in
the
beginning
one
of
the
air
force
men
or
one
of
the
construction
workers
or
one
of
the
baranof
college
students
had
said
to
her
meeting
her
on
the
street
or
in
the
uso
uh
mrs
ballantyne
i
m
going
to
be
married
day
after
tomorrow
i
thought
you
d
like
to
know
you
been
mighty
nice
to
me
getting
me
acquainted
round
and
so
on
i
m
having
some
trouble
getting
her
a
place
to
stay
overnight
she
s
coming
in
on
the
noon
plane
from
seattle
tomorrow
the
girl
on
the
plane
had
kept
her
hair
in
pins
until
the
last
possible
moment
and
had
then
rushed
to
the
lavatory
to
unpin
the
curls
that
sprang
in
lovely
tendrils
to
frame
the
flushed
or
pale
face
the
eyes
wide
with
sudden
doubt
tell
which
was
heartbeat
and
which
the
throbbing
of
the
great
plane
s
engines
she
put
her
hand
to
her
breast
where
his
air
force
ring
hung
suspended
by
a
slender
gold
chain
there
had
been
young
men
on
the
plane
and
these
had
eyed
her
with
interest
and
speculation
and
longing
but
now
they
relinquished
their
fantasies
her
face
was
pressed
against
the
window
as
the
plane
taxied
in
her
eyes
searched
the
figures
at
the
airport
gate
there
he
was
and
beside
him
and
speaking
to
him
was
a
white
haired
woman
who
looked
a
little
like
her
mother
only
more
smartly
dressed
the
eager
young
men
in
the
plane
said
one
to
another
give
it
up
boy
she
s
fetched
there
had
arrived
dozens
scores
hundreds
of
these
in
baranof
in
the
past
few
years
addie
barnett
had
been
one
of
them
and
paul
barnett
had
been
the
man
at
the
gate
peering
nearsightedly
at
the
figures
spilling
from
the
plane
s
maw
and
now
bridie
met
the
day
no
one
quite
knew
why
she
did
it
bridie
knew
and
perhaps
thor
storm
he
once
said
to
her
it
s
because
of
the
way
you
came
to
alaska
that
day
is
nt
it
bridie
i
guess
so
she
admitted
and
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
as
she
remembered
the
girl
in
the
picture
hat
and
the
long
sweeping
skirt
who
had
clambered
up
the
beach
in
response
to
would
turn
loose
the
story
mark
had
sent
with
a
commercial
pilot
a
week
earlier
suppose
i
do
nt
get
a
phone
call
from
mandria
at
ten
the
hell
off
cyprus
unless
you
want
to
cover
my
hanging
that
might
be
nice
mark
said
he
finished
his
drink
by
the
way
ari
said
looking
out
to
the
water
kitty
has
nt
beenpin
the
camp
since
we
were
forced
to
put
karen
on
the
exodus
list
that
s
right
she
s
with
me
at
the
dome
how
is
she
how
in
hell
do
you
think
sheds
she
s
miserable
she
does
nt
want
karen
to
go
on
the
exodus
do
you
blame
her
i
do
nt
blame
her
but
i
feel
sorry
for
her
that
s
nice
i
did
nt
know
you
felt
sorry
for
anyone
i
feel
sorry
that
she
has
let
her
emotions
get
the
best
of
her
i
forgot
you
do
nt
know
anything
about
human
emotions
you
re
nervous
mark
mark
was
angry
at
ari
s
placidness
and
told
him
that
karen
was
going
on
the
ship
what
do
you
want
kitty
has
suffered
more
than
one
personhas
a
right
to
suffer
suffered
ari
said
i
wonder
if
kitty
fremont
knows
the
mean
ing
of
the
word
damn
you
ben
canaan
damn
you
what
makes
you
think
that
jews
own
a
copyright
on
suffering
fortunately
you
re
not
being
paid
to
like
me
and
i
could
nt
care
less
how
could
you
you
see
i
like
people
with
human
weaknesses
i
never
have
them
during
working
hours
mark
stood
up
to
leave
ari
grabbed
mark
s
arm
in
his
powerful
hand
for
the
first
time
mark
saw
ben
canaan
shaken
from
his
complacency
there
was
anger
in
ari
s
eyes
what
the
hell
do
you
think
this
is
a
tea
party
on
the
duchess
s
lawn
we
re
butting
heads
with
the
british
empire
tomorrow
he
released
his
grip
on
at
that
instant
mark
felt
a
tiny
bit
sorry
for
ari
perhaps
he
had
a
better
way
of
disguising
it
but
the
pressure
was
beginning
to
tell
on
him
too
a
few
hours
later
mark
had
returned
to
the
dome
hotel
in
kyrenia
i
le
knocked
on
kitty
s
door
she
managed
to
greet
him
with
a
half
smile
but
it
could
not
disguise
her
red
rimmed
eyes
tomorrow
kitty
froze
an
instant
so
soon
they
are
afraid
the
british
are
on
to
something
kitty
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
pier
and
the
island
it
was
a
crystal
clear
evening
and
she
could
even
see
the
faint
outline
of
the
turkish
coast
i
ve
been
trying
to
get
up
enough
toursgeto
pack
up
and
leave
cyprus
look
mark
said
as
soon
as
this
blows
over
you
and
i
are
going
to
head
for
the
riviera
for
a
few
weeks
to
pick
up
the
pieces
i
thought
i
doubt
if
the
british
will
let
me
in
after
this
kitty
i
feel
pretty
rotten
about
dragging
you
into
this
thing
it
is
nt
your
fault
mark
you
read
that
line
well
but
it
s
not
quite
true
are
you
going
to
get
over
this
yes
i
think
so
i
should
have
known
better
you
tried
to
warn
me
at
least
i
knew
all
the
time
that
i
was
on
thin
ice
you
know
mark
it
s
funny
but
we
argued
the
night
i
met
ben
canaan
i
told
you
there
was
something
different
about
jews
they
are
nt
like
us
they
have
an
unlimited
capacity
for
getting
into
trouble
it
s
their
favorite
sport
mark
said
spinning
off
the
bed
and
rubbing
his
temples
well
one
way
or
the
other
we
might
as
well
eat
and
i
m
hungry
kitty
leaned
against
the
doorframe
as
mark
splashed
his
face
with
cold
water
one
mark
it
s
going
to
be
very
dangerous
on
the
exodus
is
nt
it
he
hesitated
a
moment
there
was
no
use
trying
to
fool
her
at
this
point
it
s
a
floating
bomb
kitty
s
heart
sank
tell
me
the
truth
can
they
get
away
with
this
they
have
a
fair
chance
with
that
mechanical
monster
ari
ben
canaan
running
the
show
the
sun
went
down
and
it
was
night
mark
and
kitty
sat
wordlessly
in
her
room
no
use
sitting
up
all
night
he
said
at
last
do
nt
go
kitty
said
i
ll
just
stretch
out
over
the
covers
she
reached
into
the
night
stand
and
took
out
a
couple
of
sleeping
pills
turned
off
the
light
and
lay
back
mark
sat
by
the
window
and
watched
the
surf
slap
against
the
shore
twenty
minutes
passed
he
looked
over
at
kitty
and
saw
she
had
fallen
into
a
and
stood
over
her
for
several
moments
then
covered
her
with
a
blanket
and
returned
to
the
chair
at
caraolos
dov
and
karen
sat
on
his
cot
too
excited
to
sleep
they
spoke
in
whispers
they
were
the
only
ones
among
the
childrenwho
knew
what
the
new
day
would
bring
karen
tried
to
calm
dov
he
kept
whispering
what
he
was
going
to
do
when
he
got
to
palestine
how
he
was
going
to
join
the
terroristsand
kill
british
soldiers
she
hushed
him
up
as
only
she
could
and
finally
induced
him
to
lie
down
as
he
closed
his
eyes
karen
stood
up
and
a
strange
sensation
swept
through
her
body
odd
and
frightening
dov
meant
more
to
her
than
she
had
realized
until
this
moment
first
it
had
been
pity
now
dov
had
a
hold
on
her
she
did
not
understand
it
she
wanted
to
be
able
to
go
and
talk
it
over
with
kitty
but
kitty
was
gone
karen
i
am
here
dov
the
company
hmjfc
three
men
lay
on
their
cots
wide
eyed
zev
gilboa
dared
think
about
springtime
in
galilee
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
year
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
child
and
of
the
farm
his
baby
had
been
only
a
few
months
thing
was
just
a
great
big
god
damn
waste
of
time
that
s
all
you
re
sore
about
that
they
wasted
your
time
danny
s
the
corner
of
his
lower
lip
he
stared
at
george
for
several
moments
then
his
face
cleared
the
way
it
always
did
when
he
had
something
figured
out
and
danny
grinned
georgie
boy
he
said
what
else
do
you
want
me
to
be
sore
about
again
in
his
mind
george
ran
through
some
of
those
things
uncle
zisha
had
said
years
ago
about
judge
brandeis
and
the
land
of
opportunity
only
a
little
while
ago
in
the
corridor
of
the
allied
employment
agency
there
had
been
enough
power
in
those
rememberedphrases
to
make
george
haul
off
and
belt
a
total
stranger
now
in
the
light
of
danny
s
grin
the
phrases
suddenly
seemed
embarrassing
i
do
nt
want
you
to
be
sore
about
anything
george
said
uncomfortably
it
s
just
that
i
do
nt
know
getting
roosted
out
on
my
tail
like
that
just
because
i
m
a
jew
it
burned
me
up
what
s
that
got
danny
said
george
did
nt
answer
every
place
you
go
there
s
bastards
they
do
nt
like
hecbs
most
of
them
they
can
drop
dead
who
needs
them
but
the
other
ones
the
guys
they
got
the
jobs
to
hand
out
you
go
around
letting
these
stupid
jerks
burn
you
up
just
because
they
do
nt
like
the
shape
of
your
beak
where
the
hell
you
going
to
get
the
dough
to
pay
for
your
oh
henrys
george
did
nt
know
how
to
answer
that
any
more
than
the
people
of
fourth
street
who
had
tried
to
get
danny
s
father
to
stop
danny
from
running
errands
for
mike
gerrity
had
known
how
to
answer
mr
schorr
when
the
house
painter
asked
them
if
they
planned
to
make
him
another
rockefeller
the
grin
slid
away
from
danny
s
face
you
got
to
keep
your
eye
on
the
ball
he
said
belting
guys
because
they
do
nt
like
jews
that
s
okay
if
you
want
to
be
a
hero
but
mind
what
you
want
danny
paused
and
the
bright
restless
brown
eyes
seemed
to
grow
a
little
brighter
what
do
you
want
kid
he
said
quietly
you
want
a
job
or
you
want
to
be
a
hero
what
george
wanted
all
of
a
sudden
was
a
hole
to
crawl
into
he
dropped
his
glance
ile
was
ashamed
of
what
he
had
just
done
in
the
allied
employment
agency
ile
felt
grateful
to
danny
for
straightening
him
out
he
wondered
why
anybody
as
smart
as
danny
schorr
bothered
to
be
friends
with
somebody
as
dumb
as
george
hurst
sure
i
want
a
job
he
muttered
but
when
you
want
a
job
it
s
the
guy
who
s
got
the
job
to
give
that
calls
the
buts
danny
grinned
and
poked
george
gently
with
his
fist
come
on
dempsey
he
said
let
s
get
going
where
to
george
said
danny
said
the
fact
that
the
place
proved
to
be
the
home
office
of
l
l
parker
stores
inc
did
not
strike
george
as
amazing
until
months
later
when
he
came
to
know
something
about
the
origin
of
the
policies
by
which
the
large
organization
was
run
on
the
day
when
he
and
danny
schorr
were
turned
away
by
the
allied
employment
agency
george
had
never
even
heard
of
l
l
parker
stores
inc
this
was
not
surprising
the
l
l
parker
stores
which
were
spread
across
the
face
of
america
like
acne
functioned
most
successfully
in
towns
with
a
population
under
there
were
those
who
attributed
this
success
to
a
belief
that
the
incidence
of
gullibility
varies
in
direct
proportion
to
the
size
of
a
community
or
as
an
embittered
rival

ludwig
leo
pauker
the
once
penniless
german
immigrant
who
founded
the
company
explained
it
somewhat
differently
at
the
eightieth
birthday
dinner
given
in
his
honor
him
into
the
highly
prosperous
business
soon
after
i
came
to
this
country
i
learned
an
important
lesson
the
old
man
said
according
to
a
stenographic
record
of
his
speech
that
was
circulated
surreptitiously
for
years
by
disgruntled
employees
you
buy
something
for
one
dollar
you
sell
it
for
two
dollars
maybe
you
make
a
profit
and
maybe
you
do
nt
depends
on
how
much
of
that
second
dollar
you
have
to
pay
out
for
overhead
but
you
buy
something
for
one
dollar
and
you
sell
it
for
twenty
dollars
and
even
a
lousy
businessman
can
make
a
profit
regardless
of
overhead
there
are
only
two
problems
where
do
you
find
damn
fools
willing
to
pay
twenty
dollars
for
something
that
cost
you
only
one
dollar
and
how
do
you
get
them
to
pay
it
the
answer
to
the
first
question
proved
to
be
stick
to
communitiestoo
small
to
support
many
stores
thus
narrowing
the
purchaser
srange
of
choice
the
answer
to
the
second
question
was
even
simpler
make
the
purchaser
something
that
cost
you
only
one
a
girl
sees
a
hat
in
a
window
and
she
wants
it
continued
the
stenographic
transcript
of
the
multimillionaire
octagenarian
s
birthday
lremarks
the
hat
has
a
price
tag
on
it
that
says
twenty
dollars
but
the
girl
has
in
her
pocket
only
three
dollars
you
say
to
the
girl
forget
the
twenty
dollar
price
tag
give
me
the
three
dollars
and
you
take
the
hat
her
eyes
get
big
as
pickle
barrels
and
she
says
you
mean
it
to
prove
you
mean
it
you
take
the
hat
out
of
the
window
and
you
give
it
to
her
and
she
gives
you
her
three
dollars
while
she
s
trying
the
hat
on
you
say
the
other
seventeen
dollars
you
can
forget
just
remember
only
one
thing
for
the
next
seventeen
weeks
every
payclay
you
come
in
and
give
me
another
dollar
that
s
all
just
one
dollar
every
payday
that
s
not
a
lot
is
it
a
in
our
yard
shouting
trick
or
treat
trick
or
treat
and
my
gentle
father
who
had
never
spanked
me
looking
at
me
with
a
pained
expression
saying
son
this
was
supposed
to
be
your
job
he
did
the
job
himself
before
my
eyes
whatever
it
was
yes
i
assumed
on
slightest
provocation
a
disapproving
attitude
toward
myself
and
readily
took
the
blame
for
things
that
were
not
my
fault
how
shrewdly
marrow
sensed
this
and
moved
in
and
moving
in
opened
the
way
to
crippling
himself
because
his
appetite
for
destructiveness
was
insatiable
for
two
big
submarine
building
yards
at
kiel
germania
werft
and
deutsche
werke
but
we
had
been
crossed
off
the
list
because
the
found
some
trouble
in
a
turbo
and
had
grounded
the
body
black
was
up
on
a
wing
opening
up
the
cowling
of
the
ailing
engine
marrow
approached
and
he
called
up
sergeant
black
a
screwdriver
was
put
down
on
the
wing
with
more
energy
than
was
necessary
and
a
dark
haired
pale
faced
head
appeared
over
the
leading
edge
of
the
wing
listen
to
me
sergeant
marrow
said
and
out
came
a
tirade
for
marrow
could
not
stand
frustration
least
of
all
frustration
of
his
urge
to
fly
our
crew
chief
was
a
strange
bird
he
was
subject
to
lightning
changes
of
temper
immediately
after
having
been
talking
with
us
on
the
hardstand
early
any
morning
before
a
take
off
in
an
obviously
jolly
mood
beaming
like
a
seraph
and
going
off
trolling
snatches
from
i
m
dreaming
of
a
white
christmas
or
waltzing
matilda
in
a
loud
voice
off
key
he
could
suddenly
be
heard
to
have
switched
with
no
apparent
cause
to
a
blowtorch
and
banging
tools
down
on
the
skin
of
our
poor
ship
and
he
s
a
bastard
too
a
second
f
ing
lieutenant
of
a
bastard
black
was
a
small
man
in
his
early
thirties
with
a
big
pocked
plow
of
a
nose
not
at
all
a
standardized
he
went
around
in
coveralls
but
swung
the
upper
part
off
his
shoulders
and
let
the
loose
folds
and
sleeves
hang
down
from
his
belted
waist
and
his
dead
white
arms
were
always
streaked
with
black
grease
marks
i
do
nt
know
why
he
was
nicknamed
red
unless
as
a
tribute
to
his
temper
he
was
outwardly
servile
toward
all
officers
from
the
rank
of
first
lieutenant
upwards
but
he
seemed
to
consider
second
loocys
like
me
some
species
of
schoolboy
to
be
hazed
and
gulled
at
every
turn
under
his
fawning
manners
there
lurked
a
tyrant
let
a
corporal
from
the
motor
pool
make
a
false
move
on
our
dispersal
point
and
red
would
land
on
him
like
a
hod
full
of
mortar
you
where
you
out
from
under
that
wing
but
the
other
members
of
the
ground
crew
swore
by
the
chief
whose
meticulousness
as
a
mechanic
and
whose
worship
of
the
body
were
unbounded
he
was
a
dedicated
workman
and
this
was
precisely
the
point
on
which
marrow
attacked
him
pour
lives
depended
on
black
s
carefulness
yet
marrow
accused
him
in
vile
insulting
terms
of
being
too
cautious
black
appeared
to
be
in
an
agony
of
agreeableness
as
marrow
undermined
his
talent
his
triple
checking
cautiousness
marrow
said
red
should
have
let
the
turbo
go
another
day
so
the
body
would
not
have
missed
a
mission
if
we
d
lost
an
engine
so
what
ships
came
home
every
day
on
three
marrow
made
it
out
that
black
s
care
was
a
kind
of
timidity
and
that
such
timidity
would
lose
us
the
war
in
the
end
marrow
made
black
s
finest
quality
as
a
mechanic
seem
traitorous
we
played
in
a
pickup
ball
game
with
some
ground
grippers
while
the
mission
was
being
flown
that
day
throwing
arm
funny
that
made
me
sore
i
guessed
i
was
as
bright
as
haverstraw
taking
aptitudes
for
number
concepts
and
for
verbal
concepts
together
it
was
just
that
i
was
nt
a
lousy
idiot
savant
your
mathematical
nut
haverstraw
would
always
be
flashier
than
your
all
round
socially
adjusted
intelligent
high
achiever
boman
and
when
buzz
found
out
that
haverstraw
could
remember
his
dames
phone
numbers
for
him
and
peg
a
ball
like
peewee
reese
he
went
all
the
way
off
his
conker
phooey
on
that
later
that
afternoon
i
felt
low
i
wanted
to
quit
the
whole
show
i
sat
in
our
room
alone
and
i
could
hear
test
firing
at
the
clay
bank
and
as
i
looked
through
the
window
at
the
meadow
on
the
near
side
of
the
flight
line
an
english
farmer
crossed
in
the
middle
distance
plodding
behind
six
guernsey
cows
oblivious
apparently
to
the
firing
he
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
simply
kept
on
walking
with
a
heavy
my
chest
ached
for
daphne
p
at
the
interrogation
after
a
mission
we
flew
the
next
day
may
fifteenth
we
caught
as
our
interrogating
officer
an
apple
cheeked
captain
from
wing
headquarters
who
wore
an
unconvincing
mustache
more
a
plea
than
a
declaration
this
mother
s
boy
got
off
on
the
wrong
foot
with
us
right
away
by
asking
which
mission
this
had
been
for
us
it
was
our
sixth
oh
he
said
on
a
groaning
note
which
had
the
effect
of
dismissing
us
as
beginners
and
therefore
unreliable
we
had
thought
ourselves
rather
seasoned
the
interrogation
was
held
in
the
briefing
hut
into
which
a
number
of
small
tables
had
been
moved
an
interrogator
sat
at
each
table
with
a
stack
of
report
forms
before
him
and
he
took
on
one
crew
at
a
time
when
our
turn
came
we
of
the
body
gathered
around
the
pink
faced
young
captain
s
table
some
sitting
and
some
standing
we
were
still
in
flying
gear
with
our
jackets
unzipped
heads
and
several
of
us
held
white
mugs
of
coffee
well
our
child
captain
began
giving
us
a
hard
time
it
seemed
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
other
interrogators
even
our
own
from
the
hear
she
thundered
at
both
of
them
and
trembling
she
poured
in
great
haste
three
glasses
full
of
red
wine
to
all
of
us
she
cried
with
great
vigor
raising
her
glass
to
girard
girard
malcolm
exclaimed
loudly
to
which
he
got
no
response
from
i
was
on
the
third
floor
attending
the
jazz
rehearsal
eloisa
said
i
could
not
control
my
nerves
i
felt
perhaps
because
malcolm
is
here
something
terrible
was
going
to
happen
i
could
hardly
wait
to
get
back
here
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
be
happy
you
can
lead
such
a
full
life
kermit
told
eloisa
accept
danger
as
part
of
the
risk
please
eloisa
said
and
she
looked
happy
for
the
first
time
that
afternoon
i
will
not
please
kermit
told
her
you
have
experienced
nearly
everything
except
perhaps
being
under
fire
in
battle
marriages
musicians
art
love
all
the
dazzle
and
excitement
that
can
only
come
to
a
figure
of
the
arts
you
re
rubbing
it
in
now
eloisa
became
ill
tempered
again
no
i
am
speaking
from
the
heart
kermit
assured
her
you
deserve
your
coterie
such
as
it
is
perhaps
no
other
woman
ever
set
foot
i
knew
it
eloisa
cried
helplessly
you
re
ribbing
me
you
invented
modern
jazz
do
nt
deny
it
the
little
man
went
over
to
eloisa
s
chair
stop
him
eloisa
implored
malcolm
with
a
look
of
futility
and
your
marriage
to
jerome
kermit
went
on
is
it
not
the
marriage
of
the
century
kermit
stop
right
there
with
my
marriage
if
you
go
further
and
she
made
a
frantic
gesture
i
ca
nt
hear
no
not
even
a
compliment
concerning
my
marriage
my
marriage
is
too
close
somehow
to
too
close
to
what
a
deep
feminine
voice
cried
from
the
entrance
to
the
room
all
eyes
looked
up
to
see
madame
girard
coming
into
the
center
of
the
room
a
sun
parasol
in
her
hand
closing
her
eyes
and
raising
her
parasol
gently
into
the
air
she
given
the
sign
madame
girard
cleared
her
throat
but
she
did
not
need
to
wait
for
silence
she
had
created
the
deepest
kind
possible
addressing
again
now
her
auditors
she
said
i
have
only
come
here
to
claim
what
is
my
own
a
reasonable
re
quest
i
am
of
course
a
reasonable
woman
let
there
be
no
interruptions
please
madame
girard
turned
to
malcolm
who
had
stood
up
only
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
hear
her
better
but
she
had
construed
his
movement
as
an
attempt
to
interpolate
sit
down
madame
girard
commanded
malcolm
sotto
voce
she
continued
closing
her
eyes
again
why
should
the
rest
of
the
world
know
plenty
happiness
domestic
satisfaction
love
while
i
am
shut
out
from
all
these
things
deprived
of
a
woman
s
human
station
in
life
turned
in
upon
my
own
devices
and
saddled
here
she
opened
her
eyes
directly
and
immediately
upon
the
tray
with
the
with
a
husband
who
knows
not
whether
i
am
alive
or
dead
and
cares
yes
cares
dear
eloisa
i
can
feel
you
are
shaking
your
head
so
stop
cares
less
madame
girard
eloisa
managed
to
get
out
silence
i
say
madame
girard
addressed
herself
briefly
to
eloisa
i
know
you
are
a
woman
of
talent
perhaps
genius
but
your
words
your
advice
whatever
you
have
to
offer
here
this
afternoon
is
worth
no
more
to
me
than
yesterday
s
bath
water
kermit
shrank
into
his
chair
his
bravado
of
a
moment
ago
completely
vanished
while
gazing
glassily
at
the
woman
he
had
feared
so
long
to
meet
but
since
she
kept
her
eyes
closed
allowed
him
for
the
time
being
to
stare
at
her
with
impunity
malcolm
began
to
look
sleepy
and
eloisa
brace
overcome
by
the
day
s
fare
of
brandy
wine
fear
and
confusion
began
whimpering
softly
i
have
been
called
unreasonable
by
still
tightly
closed
and
fluttering
like
a
medium
who
sees
the
ghost
she
had
never
thought
to
catch
i
who
am
the
most
reasonable
of
women
the
kindest
the
most
generous
the
one
who
wants
to
give
all
her
love
yes
all
here
madame
girard
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
when
they
fell
on
eloisa
the
latter
cried
out
stop
her
oh
stop
her
somebody
madame
girard
closed
her
eyes
again
but
then
changing
her
mind
she
opened
them
suddenly
and
said
will
you
be
quiet
lady
while
i
am
delivering
my
speech
why
do
you
think
i
am
here
but
to
get
you
to
see
reason
hear
reason
follow
reason
reason
eloisa
cried
for
good
god
s
sake
why
does
this
house
not
fall
upon
us
when
such
words
are
spoken
kermit
brought
eloisa
her
wine
glass
which
in
the
confusion
of
madame
girard
s
entrance
she
had
put
madame
girard
continued
and
raising
her
parasol
a
bit
too
carelessly
the
point
of
it
caught
one
of
the
stuffed
owls
which
rested
on
the
mantle
and
brought
it
flying
to
the
carpet
where
it
suddenly
disintegrated
into
a
heap
of
dust
and
feathers
do
nt
touch
it
madame
girard
warned
at
the
signs
of
motion
on
eloisa
s
part
you
shall
be
repaid
triple
for
this
damage
but
to
get
back
she
went
on
wronged
not
only
by
that
satyr
girard
girard
who
has
divided
his
lifetime
into
passion
for
money
and
lust
with
servant
girls
no
no
madame
girard
you
wrong
him
malcolm
exclaimed
standing
up
will
you
keep
these
immature
ephebes
seated
and
silent
or
shall
i
summon
someone
who
can
madame
girard
turned
her
anger
against
eloisa
brace
she
was
about
to
continue
when
her
attention
was
distracted
by
the
extreme
awe
written
on
the
face
of
the
midget
strolling
sat
cringing
looking
as
madame
girard
later
de
scribed
him
like
a
kinkajou
at
noon
madame
girard
studied
him
closely
for
a
moment
and
then
delivered
a
resounding
kiss
as
stooping
she
bent
over
his
mouth
she
immediately
returned
to
the
center
of
the
room
to
resume
speaking
but
kermit
touching
himself
hair
glistening
in
the
sun
then
as
they
watched
she
vanished
where
did
she
go
mato
cried
woman
woman
teroro
called
vainly
the
two
young
men
consulted
as
to
whether
they
should
advise
the
hawaii
from
the
sun
swept
lagoon
smiled
and
was
relaxed
for
she
was
certain
that
somewhere
out
beyond
the
coral
she
would
encounter
her
personal
god
mano
the
wild
blue
shark
mano
she
cried
at
last
i
am
coming
to
talk
with
you
and
she
was
carried
far
from
land
when
dawn
rose
accompanied
by
new
explosions
of
ash
and
flame
king
tamatoa
studied
his
stricken
community
and
he
could
explain
the
ravages
especially
the
fallen
temple
planted
alive
at
three
of
the
corners
but
teroro
would
not
tolerate
such
reasoning
we
are
punished
because
we
forgot
our
most
ancient
goddess
and
because
we
built
in
the
wrong
place
he
insisted
how
wrong
the
place
was
would
now
be
proved
for
mato
came
running
with
the
news
that
up
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
creeping
wall
of
fire
was
slowly
descending
toward
the
settlement
a
dozen
men
went
back
into
the
trees
and
climbed
toward
where
mato
had
pointed
and
they
saw
a
fearful
thing
above
them
and
marching
over
all
obstacles
on
its
way
to
the
sea
came
a
relentless
wall
of
fiery
rock
and
molten
lava
turning
over
and
over
upon
itself
devouring
trees
and
rocks
and
valleys
its
ugly
snout
thirty
feet
high
was
not
ablaze
and
seemed
dead
until
it
struck
a
dried
tree
whereupon
flames
leaped
mysteriously
into
the
air
at
intervals
long
tongues
of
molten
rock
spurted
through
the
ominously
creeping
front
and
spread
out
like
water
it
was
it
will
be
upon
us
by
tomorrow
the
men
calculated
when
he
was
satisfied
with
the
news
king
tamatoa
reacted
without
fear
for
his
brother
s
bold
words
had
strengthened
him
he
commanded
we
will
first
pray
for
the
old
woman
teura
and
he
blessed
her
to
the
gods
when
this
was
finished
he
said
calmly
all
planted
things
will
be
dug
up
immediately
and
wrapped
carefully
even
if
you
must
use
your
own
clothes
then
he
showed
the
slaves
how
to
load
the
canoe
and
when
at
a
distance
of
less
than
three
miles
the
molten
lava
began
pouring
over
a
low
cliff
like
a
flaming
waterfall
he
studied
it
for
a
long
time
then
he
said
we
will
stay
ashore
tonight
and
get
all
things
ready
in
the
morning
we
will
leave
this
place
pa
says
he
has
found
a
promising
land
to
the
west
through
the
night
the
settlers
worked
seeing
one
another
in
the
dim
flares
ready
to
go
they
had
recovered
much
of
their
seed
and
had
saved
their
gods
their
pigs
and
their
canoe
with
these
they
escaped
but
when
they
were
safe
at
sea
they
saw
the
vast
fiery
front
of
the
lava
break
through
onto
their
plateau
where
it
ate
its
way
impersonally
across
all
things
the
temple
site
was
burned
away
in
a
flash
the
fields
where
crops
had
rested
were
gone
the
taro
patch
was
filled
with
fire
and
the
cave
disappeared
behind
a
wall
of
flame
from
the
plateau
the
cascade
of
fire
found
a
valley
leading
down
into
the
sea
and
after
building
its
strength
aloft
it
plunged
down
this
avenue
and
poured
into
the
ocean
when
it
struck
the
water
it
hissed
and
groaned
it
threw
columns
of
steam
into
the
air
and
exploded
the
waves
it
sent
noisy
reports
of
its
triumph
and
filled
the
sky
with
ash
and
then
conquered
by
the
patient
and
accommodating
ocean
t
fell
silently
into
dark
caverns
as
it
the
men
of
havaiki
seeing
for
the
first
time
the
incredible
fury
of
which
their
new
land
was
capable
sat
awestruck
in
their
canoe
and
watched
for
a
long
time
the
cataclysm
that
had
destroyed
their
home
but
a
gust
of
wind
stronger
than
the
rest
carried
down
from
the
crest
of
the
volcano
a
wisp
of
hair
spun
by
the
breezes
from
the
molten
lava
and
teroro
caught
the
hair
and
held
it
aloft
where
the
sun
played
on
it
and
he
saw
that
it
was
the
hair
which
the
strange
woman
in
the
forest
had
worn
and
he
announced
it
was
the
goddess
pere
she
came
not
to
frighten
us
but
to
warn
us
we
did
not
understand
his
words
gave
the
people
in
the
canoe
great
hope
for
if
the
goddess
had
thought
enough
of
her
erring
people
to
warn
them
she
must
retain
some
love
for
them
and
all
was
not
lost
the
hair
of
pere
was
given
to
the
king
as
an
omen
and
sow
because
if
this
animal
did
not
live
and
deliver
her
litter
it
would
be
as
bad
an
omen
as
the
volcano
in
this
manner
but
bearing
only
half
the
cargo
with
which
they
had
arrived
and
a
bred
sow
clothed
in
pere
s
hair
the
voyagers
started
for
a
new
home
and
pa
and
mato
had
chosen
wisely
for
they
led
their
companions
around
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
and
up
the
western
coast
until
they
found
fine
land
with
soil
that
could
be
tilled
and
water
and
it
was
here
that
the
settlement
of
havaiki
began
in
earnest
with
new
fields
and
a
new
temple
built
without
sacrifices
when
the
sow
threw
her
litter
the
king
himself
watched
over
the
young
pigs
and
when
the
largest
and
strongest
reached
a
size
at
which
he
could
have
been
eaten
and
mouths
had
begun
to
water
for
the
taste
of
roast
pig
the
king
and
old
tupuna
carried
the
pig
reverently
to
the
new
temple
and
sacrificed
it
to
lane
from
then
on
tupuna
took
the
steps
which
were
to
give
it
the
characteristics
which
marked
it
permanently
he
said
one
day
to
the
king
soon
i
shall
follow
teura
but
before
i
go
upon
the
rainbow
we
ought
to
protect
the
life
of
ur
people
it
is
not
good
hi
face
it
was
a
big
tired
face
tonight
and
shel
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
the
