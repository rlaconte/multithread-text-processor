and
for
the
last
time
stand
face
to
face
with
the
ghost
of
the
dead
in
the
home
of
the
dead
o
white
heart
and
black
body
i
look
into
your
heart
and
it
is
white
as
milk
and
the
milk
of
innocence
shall
save
it
fool
why
do
you
strike
that
blow
let
him
be
who
is
loved
of
the
tiger
and
whose
love
is
as
the
love
of
a
tiger
ah
what
face
is
that
in
the
battle
follow
it
follow
it
o
swift
of
foot
but
follow
warily
for
the
tongue
that
has
lied
will
never
plead
for
mercy
and
the
hand
that
can
betray
is
strong
in
war
white
heart
what
is
death
in
death
life
lives
and
among
the
dead
you
shall
find
the
life
you
lost
for
there
awaits
you
she
whom
kings
and
waters
cannot
harm
as
the
bee
spoke
by
degrees
her
voice
sank
lower
and
lower
till
it
was
almost
inaudible
then
it
ceased
altogether
and
she
seemed
to
pass
from
trance
to
sleep
hadden
who
had
been
listening
to
her
with
an
amused
and
cynical
smile
now
laughed
aloud
why
do
you
laugh
white
man
asked
nahoon
angrily
i
laugh
at
my
own
folly
in
wasting
time
listening
to
the
nonsense
of
that
lying
fraud
it
is
no
nonsense
white
man
indeed
then
will
you
tell
me
what
it
means
i
cannot
tell
you
what
it
means
yet
but
her
words
have
to
do
with
a
woman
and
a
leopard
and
with
your
fate
and
my
fate
hadden
shrugged
his
shoulders
not
thinking
the
matter
worth
further
argument
and
at
that
moment
the
bee
woke
up
shivering
drew
the
red
snake
from
her
head
dress
and
coiling
it
about
her
throat
wrapped
herself
again
in
the
greasy
kaross
are
you
satisfied
with
my
wisdom
inkoos
she
asked
of
hadden
i
am
satisfied
that
you
are
one
of
the
cleverest
cheats
in
zululand
mother
he
answered
coolly
now
what
is
there
to
pay
the
bee
took
no
offence
at
this
rude
speech
though
for
a
second
or
two
the
look
in
her
eyes
grew
strangely
like
that
which
they
had
seen
in
those
of
the
snake
when
the
fumes
of
the
fire
made
it
angry
if
the
white
lord
says
i
am
a
cheat
it
must
be
so
she
answered
for
he
of
all
men
should
be
able
to
discern
a
cheat
i
have
said
that
i
ask
no
fee
yes
give
me
a
little
tobacco
from
your
pouch
hadden
opened
the
bag
of
antelope
hide
and
drawing
some
tobacco
from
it
gave
it
to
her
in
taking
it
she
clasped
his
hand
and
examined
the
gold
ring
that
was
upon
the
third
finger
a
ring
fashioned
like
a
snake
with
two
little
rubies
set
in
the
head
to
represent
the
eyes
i
wear
a
snake
about
my
neck
and
you
wear
one
upon
your
hand
inkoos
i
should
like
to
have
this
ring
to
wear
upon
my
hand
so
that
the
snake
about
my
neck
may
be
less
lonely
there
then
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
wait
till
i
am
dead
said
hadden
yes
yes
she
answered
in
a
pleased
voice
it
is
a
good
word
i
will
wait
till
you
are
dead
and
then
i
will
take
the
ring
and
none
can
say
that
i
have
stolen
it
for
nahoon
there
will
bear
me
witness
that
you
gave
me
permission
to
do
so
for
the
first
time
hadden
started
since
there
was
something
about
the
bee
s
tone
that
jarred
upon
him
had
she
addressed
him
in
her
professional
manner
he
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
but
in
her
cupidity
she
had
become
natural
and
it
was
evident
that
she
spoke
from
conviction
believing
her
own
words
she
saw
him
start
and
instantly
changed
her
note
let
the
white
lord
forgive
the
jest
of
a
poor
old
witch
doctoress
she
said
in
a
whining
voice
i
have
so
much
to
do
with
death
that
his
name
leaps
to
my
lips
and
she
glanced
first
at
the
circle
of
skulls
about
her
then
towards
the
waterfall
that
fed
the
gloomy
pool
upon
whose
banks
her
hut
was
placed
look
she
said
simply
following
the
line
of
her
outstretched
hand
hadden
s
eyes
fell
upon
two
withered
mimosa
trees
which
grew
over
the
fall
almost
at
right
angles
to
its
rocky
edge
these
trees
were
joined
together
by
a
rude
platform
made
of
logs
of
wood
lashed
down
with
riems
of
hide
upon
this
platform
stood
three
figures
notwithstanding
the
distance
and
the
spray
of
the
fall
he
could
see
that
they
were
those
of
two
men
and
a
girl
for
their
shapes
stood
out
distinctly
against
the
fiery
red
of
the
sunset
sky
one
instant
there
were
three
the
next
there
were
two
for
the
girl
had
gone
and
something
dark
rushing
down
the
face
of
the
fall
struck
the
surface
of
the
pool
with
a
heavy
thud
while
a
faint
and
piteous
cry
broke
upon
his
ear
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
he
asked
horrified
and
amazed
nothing
answered
the
bee
with
a
laugh
do
you
not
know
then
that
this
is
the
place
where
faithless
women
or
girls
who
have
loved
without
the
leave
of
the
king
are
brought
to
meet
their
death
and
with
them
their
accomplices
oh
they
die
here
thus
each
day
and
i
watch
them
die
and
keep
the
count
of
the
number
of
them
and
drawing
a
tally
stick
from
the
thatch
of
the
hut
she
took
a
knife
and
added
a
notch
to
the
many
that
appeared
upon
it
looking
at
nahoon
the
while
with
a
half
questioning
half
warning
gaze
yes
yes
it
is
a
place
of
death
she
muttered
up
yonder
the
quick
die
day
by
day
and
down
there
and
she
pointed
along
the
course
of
the
river
beyond
the
pool
to
where
the
forest
began
some
two
hundred
yards
from
her
hut
the
ghosts
rather
timidly
at
the
counter
walk
right
up
those
stairs
and
turn
to
the
left
said
a
clerk
as
he
opened
a
gate
for
me
ascending
i
met
a
big
man
coming
down
hurriedly
and
with
heavy
steps
we
stood
dodging
each
other
a
moment
with
that
unfortunate
co
ordination
of
purpose
men
sometimes
encounter
when
passing
each
other
suddeniy
the
big
man
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
stairway
and
held
both
of
his
hands
above
his
head
in
god
s
name
young
man
said
he
take
your
choice
he
spoke
in
a
high
squeaky
voice
that
cut
me
with
the
sharpness
of
its
irritation
i
went
on
past
him
and
entered
an
open
door
near
the
top
of
the
stairway
is
mr
horace
greeley
in
i
enquired
of
a
young
man
who
sat
reading
papers
back
soon
said
he
without
looking
up
take
a
chair
in
a
little
while
i
heard
the
same
heavy
feet
ascending
the
stairway
two
steps
at
a
time
then
the
man
i
had
met
came
hurriedly
into
the
room
this
is
mr
greeley
said
the
yo
mg
man
who
was
reading
the
great
editor
turned
and
looked
at
me
through
gold
rimmed
spectacles
i
gave
him
my
letter
out
of
a
trembling
hand
he
removed
it
from
the
envelope
and
held
it
close
to
his
big
kindly
smooth
shaven
face
there
was
a
fringe
of
silky
silver
hair
streaked
with
yellow
about
the
lower
part
of
his
head
from
temple
to
temple
it
also
encircled
his
throat
from
under
his
collar
his
cheeks
were
fall
and
fair
as
a
lady
s
with
rosy
spots
in
them
and
a
few
freckles
about
his
nose
he
laughed
as
he
finished
reading
the
letter
are
you
dave
brower
s
boy
he
asked
in
a
drawling
falsetto
looking
at
me
out
of
grey
eyes
and
smiling
with
good
humour
by
adoption
i
answered
he
was
an
almighty
good
rassler
he
said
deliberately
as
he
looked
again
at
the
letter
what
do
you
want
to
do
he
asked
abruptly
want
to
work
on
the
tribune
i
answered
good
lord
he
said
i
ca
nt
hire
everybody
i
tried
to
think
of
some
argument
but
what
with
looking
at
the
great
man
before
me
and
answering
his
questions
and
maintaining
a
decent
show
of
dignity
i
had
enough
to
do
do
you
read
the
tribune
he
asked
read
it
ever
since
i
can
remember
what
do
you
think
of
the
administration
lot
of
dough
faces
i
answered
smiling
as
i
saw
he
recognised
his
own
phrase
he
sat
a
moment
tapping
the
desk
with
his
penholder
there
s
so
many
liars
here
in
new
york
he
said
there
ought
to
be
room
for
an
honest
man
how
are
the
crops
fair
i
answered
big
crop
of
boys
every
year
and
now

re
trying
to
find
a
market
he
remarked
want
to
have
you
try
them
i
answered
well
said
he
very
seriously
turning
to
his
desk
that
came
up
to
his
chin
as
he
sat
beside
it
go
and
write
me
an
article
about
rats
would
you
advise
i
started
to
say
when
he
interrupted
me
the
man
that
gives
advice
is
a
bigger
fool
than
the
man
that
takes
it
he
fleered
impatiently
go
and
do
your
best
before
he
had
given
me
this
injunction
he
had
dipped
his
pen
and
begun
to
write
hurriedly
if
i
had
known
him
longer
i
should
have
known
that
while
he
had
been
talking
to
me
that
tireless
mind
of
his
had
summoned
him
to
its
service
i
went
out
in
high
spirits
and
sat
down
a
moment
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
little
park
near
by
to
think
it
all
over
he
was
going
to
measure
my
judgement
my
skill
as
a
writer
my
resources
rats
i
said
to
myself
thoughtfully
had
read
much
about
them
they
infested
the
ships
they
overran
the
wharves
they
traversed
the
sewers
an
inspiration
came
to
me
i
started
for
the
waterfront
asking
my
way
every
block
or
two
near
the
east
river
i
met
a
policeman
a
big
husky
good
hearted
irishman

i
said
who

give
me
information
about

said

glance

said

he
said
to
the
first
of
them
he
s
a
green
i
have
never
forgotten
the
kindness
of
that
irishman
whom
i
came
to
know
well
in
good
time
remembering
that
day
and
others
i
always
greeted
him
with
a
hearty
god
bless
the
irish
every
time
i
passed
him
and
he
would
answer
amen
an
save
yer
riverince
he
did
not
leave
me
until
i
was
on
my
way
home
loaded
with
fact
and
fable
and
good
dialect
with
a
savour
of
the
sea
in
it
hope
and
uncle
eb
were
sitting
together
in
his
room
when
i
returned
guess
i
ve
got
a
job
i
said
trying
to
be
very
cool
about
it
a
job
said
hope
eagerly
as
she
rose
where
with
mr
horace
greeley
i
answered
my
voice
betraying
my
excitement
jerusalem
said
uncle
eb
is
it
possible
that
s
grand
said
hope
tell
us
about
it
then
i
told
them
of
my
interview
with
the
great
editor
and
of
what
i
had
done
since
ye
done
wonderful
said
uncle
eb
and
hope
showed
quite
as
much
pleasure
in
her
own
sweet
way
i
was
for
going
to
my
room
and
beginning
to
write
at
once
but
hope
said
it
was
time
to
be
getting
ready
for
dinner
when
we
came
down
at
chance
at
last
to
that
only
the
answer
of
her
eyes
so
sweet
so
full
of
sorrow
he
stooped
above
her
his
whole
nature
torn
between
love
and
doubt
you
hear
me
he
said
in
low
broken
tones
but
you
think
yourself
a
traitor
to
listen
and
how
could
i
not
she
cried
with
a
sudden
sob
and
then
she
found
her
speech
her
heart
unveiled
itself
if
i
had
never
never
come
it
is
my
fault
that
she
is
dying
only
only
my
fault
and
she
turned
away
from
him
to
hide
her
face
and
eyes
against
the
rock
in
such
an
agony
of
feeling
that
he
almost
despaired
he
controlled
himself
sharply
putting
aside
passion
collecting
his
thoughts
for
dear
life
you
are
the
most
innocent
the
most
true
of
tender
friends
it
is
in
her
name
that
i
say
to
you
lucy
be
kind
lucy
dare
to
love
me
she
raised
her
arm
suddenly
and
pointed
to
the
ground
between
them
there
she
said
under
her
breath
i
see
her
there
lying
dead
between
us
he
was
struck
with
horror
realising
in
what
a
grip
this
sane
and
simple
nature
must
feel
itself
before
it
could
break
into
such
expression
what
could
he
do
or
say
he
seated
himself
beside
her
he
took
her
hands
by
force
lucy
i
know
what
you
mean
i
wo
nt
pretend
that
i
do
nt
know
you
think
that
i
ought
to
have
married
my
cousin
that
if
you
had
not
been
there
i
should
have
married
her
i
might
not
yet
but
after
some
time
it
is
quite
true
that
it
might
have
happened
would
it
have
made
eleanor
happy
you
saw
me
at
the
villa
as
i
am
you
know
well
that
even
as
a
friend
i
constantly
disappointed
her
there
seemed
to
be
a
fate
upon
us
which
made
me
torment
and
wound
her
when
i
least
intended
it
i
do
nt
defend
myself
and
heaven
knows
i
do
nt
blame
eleanor
i
have
always
believed
that
these
things
are
mysterious
predestined
matters
of
temperament
deeper
than
our
will
i
was
deeply
sincerely
attached
to
eleanor
yet
when
you
came
after
those
first
few
weeks
the
falsity
of
the
whole
position
flashed
upon
me
and
there
was
the
book
it
seemed
to
me
sometimes
that
the
only
way
of
extricating
us
all
was
to
destroy
the
book
and
and
all
that
it
implied
or
might
have
been
thought
to
imply
he
added
hurriedly
oh
you
need
nt
tell
me
that
i
was
a
blundering
and
selfish
fool
we
have
all
got
into
a
horrible
coil
and
i
ca
nt
pose
before
you
if
i
would
but
it
is
nt
eleanor
that
would
hold
you
back
from
me
lucy
it
is
nt
eleanor
answer
me
you
know
that
he
held
her
almost
roughly
scanning
her
face
in
an
agony
that
served
him
well
her
lips
moved
piteously
in
words
that
he
could
not
hear
but
her
hands
lay
passive
in
his
grasp
and
he
hastened
on
ever
since
that
nemi
evening
lucy
i
have
been
a
new
creature
i
will
tell
you
no
lies
i
wo
nt
say
that
i
never
loved
any
woman
before
you
i
will
have
no
secrets
from
you
you
shall
know
all
if
you
want
to
know
but
i
do
say
that
every
passion
i
ever
knew
in
my
first
youth
seems
to
me
now
a
mere
apprenticeship
to
loving
you
you
have
become
my
life
my
very
heart
if
anything
is
to
be
made
of
a
fellow
like
me
it
s
you
that
ll
give
me
a
chance
lucy
oh
my
dear
do
nt
turn
from
me
it
s
eleanor
s
voice
speaks
in
mine
listen
to
us
both
her
colour
came
and
went
she
swayed
towards
him
fascinated
by
his
voice
conquered
by
the
mere
exhaustion
of
her
long
struggle
held
in
the
grasp
of
that
compulsion
which
eleanor
had
laid
upon
her
manisty
perceived
her
weakness
his
eyes
flamed
his
arm
closed
round
her
i
had
an
instinct
a
vision
he
said
almost
in
her
ear
when
i
set
out
the
day
dawned
on
me
like
a
day
of
consecration
the
sun
was
another
sun
the
earth
reborn
i
took
up
my
pilgrimage
again
looking
for
lucy
as
i
have
looked
for
her
the
last
six
weeks
and
everything
led
me
right
the
breeze
and
the
woods
and
the
birds
they
were
all
in
league
with
me
they
pitied
me
they
told
me
where
lucy
was
the
low
rushing
words
ceased
a
moment
manisty
looked
at
her
took
both
her
hands
again
but
they
could
nt
tell
me
he
murmured
how
to
please
her
how
to
make
her
kind
to
me
make
her
listen
to
me
lucy
whom
shall
i
go
to
for
that
she
turned
away
her
face
her
hands
released
themselves
manisty
hardly
breathed
till
she
said
with
a
trembling
mouth
and
a
little
sob
now
and
then
between
the
words
it
is
all
so
strange
to
me
so
strange
and
so
so
doubtful
if
there
were
only
someone
here
from
my
own
people
someone
who
could
advise
me
is
it
wise
for
you
for
us
both
you
know
i
m
so
different
from
you
and
you
ll
find
it
out
perhaps
more
and
more
and
if
you
did
and
were
discontented
with
me
i
ca
nt
be
sure
that
i
could
always
fit
myself
to
you
i
was
brought
up
so
that
that
i
ca
nt
always
be
as
easy
and
pleasant
as
other
girls
my
mother
she
stood
by
herself
often
and
i
with
her
she
was
a
grand
nature
but
i
m
sure
you
would
have
thought
her
extravagant
and
perhaps
hard
and
often
i
feel
as
though
i
did
nt
know
myself
what
there
might
be
in
me
i
know
i
m
often
very
stubborn
suppose
in
a
few
years
her
eyes
came
back
to
him
searching
and
interrogating
that
bent
look
of
his
in
of
seeing
him
one
day
in
bronze
and
feeling
that
he
is
all
mine
for
he
has
nt
even
that
spark
of
luck
which
so
often
passes
for
infinitesimal
greatness
poor
dear
how
did
you
guess
that
she
had
the
taint
in
her
asked
betty
as
they
were
about
to
land
she
has
not
a
suggestion
of
it
in
her
face
i
felt
it
so
vaguely
that
i
scarcely
put
it
in
words
to
myself
until
lately
and
i
never
saw
such
an
amount
of
pink
on
finger
nails
in
my
life
vi
betty
went
in
search
of
harriet
and
found
her
in
a
summer
house
reading
an
innocuous
french
romance
which
her
professor
had
selected
there
was
no
place
near
by
where
miss
trumbull
might
lie
concealed
and
betty
went
to
the
point
at
once
harriet
she
said
i
am
obliged
to
say
something
horribly
painful
if
you
want
to
marry
any
man
you
must
tell
him
the
truth
it
would
be
a
crime
not
to
the
prejudices
of
of
southerners
are
deep
and
bitter
and
and
oh
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
have
to
say
but
i
must
if
you
had
children
they
might
be
black
for
a
moment
betty
thought
that
harriet
was
dead
she
turned
so
gray
and
her
gaze
was
so
fixed
but
she
spoke
in
a
moment
why
do
you
say
this
to
me
now
because
i
fear
you
and
jack
oh
i
hope
it
is
not
true
the
person
who
thinks
you
love
each
other
may
have
been
mistaken
but
i
could
not
wait
to
warn
you
i
should
have
told
you
in
the
beginning
that
when
the
time
came
either
you
must
tell
the
man
or
i
should
but
it
was
a
hateful
subject
god
knows
it
is
hard
to
speak
now
harriet
seemed
to
have
recovered
herself
the
colour
returned
slowly
to
her
face
her
heavy
lids
descended
she
rose
and
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
with
the
air
of
complete
melancholy
which
recalled
one
or
two
other
memorable
occasions
but
there
was
a
subtle
change
the
attitude
did
not
seem
so
natural
to
her
as
formerly
your
informant
was
only
half
right
she
said
sadly
i
love
him
but
he
cares
nothing
for
me
he
is
the
best
the
kindest
of
friends
it
is
no
wonder
that
i
love
him
i
suppose
i
was
bound
to
love
the
first
man
who
treated
me
with
affectionate
respect
i
reckon
i
d
have
fallen
in
love
with
uncle
if
he
d
been
younger
perhaps
in
europe
i
may
get
over
it
but
he
does
not
love
me
betty
rose
and
looked
at
her
steadily
what
was
in
the
brain
behind
those
sad
reproachful
eyes
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
girl
s
shoulder
harriet
she
said
solemnly
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
you
will
not
marry
him
without
telling
him
the
truth
it
may
be
that
he
does
not
love
you
but
he
might
and
if
you
were
without
hope
you
would
be
unhappy
promise
me
down
in
the
depths
of
those
melancholy
eyes
there
was
a
flash
then
harriet
lifted
her
head
and
spoke
with
the
solemnity
of
one
taking
an
oath
i
promise
she
said
i
will
marry
no
man
without
telling
him
the
truth
this
time
her
tone
carried
conviction
and
betty
relieved
sought
sally
carter
nonsense
exclaimed
miss
carter
when
betty
had
related
the
interview
he
is
in
love
with
her
although
for
some
reason
or
other
he
is
making
an
elaborate
effort
to
conceal
it
she
spoke
very
convincingly
said
betty
who
would
not
admit
doubt
anything
with
a
drop
of
negro
blood
in
it
will
lie
it
ca
nt
help
it
i
wish
the
race
were
exterminated
i
wish
the
english
had
left
it
in
africa
they
certainly
saddled
us
with
an
everlasting
curse
she
was
tempted
to
wish
that
mr
walker
had
never
discovered
her
address
but
although
she
did
not
love
harriet
she
was
grateful
still
for
the
opportunity
to
rescue
her
from
the
usual
fate
of
her
breed
but
assuredly
she
did
not
wish
her
old
friend
to
be
sacrificed
again
she
observed
him
closely
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
harriet
had
spoken
the
truth
he
was
gayer
than
of
old
but
his
health
was
better
and
he
was
in
cheerful
company
not
living
his
days
and
nights
in
his
lonely
damp
old
house
on
the
potomac
river
he
appeared
to
enjoy
talking
to
harriet
but
there
was
nothing
lover
like
in
his
attitude
and
he
was
almost
her
guardian
true
he
was
occasionally
moody
and
absent
but
a
man
must
retain
a
few
of
his
old
spots
and
if
he
avoided
somewhat
the
cousin
whom
he
had
once
loved
to
melancholy
it
was
doubtless
because
she
found
him
as
uninteresting
as
she
found
all
men
but
one
and
was
not
at
sufficient
pains
to
conceal
her
indifference
and
then
she
admitted
with
a
laugh
that
in
the
back
of
her
mind
she
had
never
acknowledged
the
possibility
of
his
loving
another
woman
she
but
half
admitted
that
she
wished
to
believe
no
storm
was
gathering
under
her
roof
she
had
no
desire
to
handle
a
tragedy
vii
it
was
saturday
morning
betty
arose
at
four
brewed
herself
a
cup
of
coffee
over
a
spirit
lamp
and
ate
several
biscuit
with
it
she
hoped
senator
north
would
take
the
same
precaution
healthy
animals
when
hungry
cannot
take
much
interest
in
each
other
she
dressed
herself
in
airy
white
with
a
blue
ribbon
in
her
hair
there
was
no
necessity
for
a
hat
at
that
hour
in
the
morning
but
she
took
a
white
organdie
one
down
to
the
boat
and
put
it
under
a
seat
lest
she
be
late
in
returning
and
the
sun
freckling
it
was
faintly
dawn
as
she
pulled
out
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
and
rowed
toward
its
northern
end
even
the
trailing
thickets
on
the
water
s
edge
looked
black
and
war
in
these
leisurely
beguilements
the
days
passed
until
one
morning
attusah
s
fears
and
presentiments
were
realized
in
their
seizure
by
a
party
of
cherokees
who
swooped
down
upon
their
hermitage
and
bore
them
off
by
force
to
the
council
house
of
the
town
of
citico
where
atta
kulla
kulla
and
a
number
of
other
head
men
had
assembled
to
discuss
the
critical
affairs
of
the
tribe
and
decide
on
its
future
policy
so
critical
indeed
was
the
situation
that
it
seemed
to
macvintie
that
they
might
well
dispense
with
notice
of
two
factors
so
inconsiderable
in
the
scale
of
national
importance
as
the
ada
wehi
and
his
captive
but
one
was
a
british
prisoner
calculated
to
expiate
in
a
degree
with
his
life
the
woe
and
ruin
his
comrades
had
wrought
the
more
essential
was
this
course
since
the
triumph
of
putting
him
to
the
torture
and
death
would
gratify
and
reanimate
many
whose
zeal
was
flagging
under
an
accumulation
of
anguish
and
helpless
defeat
and
stimulate
them
to
renewed
exertions
for
before
the
cherokees
would
sue
for
peace
they
waited
long
in
the
hope
that
the
french
would
yet
be
enabled
to
convey
to
them
a
sufficient
supply
of
powder
to
renew
and
prosecute
the
war
as
to
the
arrest
of
the
other
attusah
of
kanootare
this
was
necessary
in
the
event
that
submission
to
the
british
government
became
inevitable
for
since
he
claimed
to
be
a
ghost
surely
never
was
spectre
so
reckless
he
had
indeed
appeared
to
so
many
favored
individuals
that
the
english
might
fairly
have
cause
to
doubt
his
execution
in
satisfaction
of
his
crimes
against
the
government
and
the
breach
of
faith
on
the
part
of
the
cherokee
rulers
in
this
conspicuous
instance
might
well
preclude
the
granting
of
any
reasonable
terms
of
peace
now
and
subject
the
whole
nation
to
added
hardship
this
was
the
argument
advanced
by
atta
kulla
kulla
as
he
stood
and
addressed
his
colleagues
who
sat
on
buffalo
skins
in
a
circle
on
the
floor
of
the
council
house
of
citico
the
usual
dome
shaped
edifice
daubed
within
and
without
with
the
rich
red
clay
of
the
country
and
situated
on
a
high
artificial
mound
in
the
centre
of
the
town
the
council
fire
alone
gave
light
flashing
upon
the
slender
figure
and
animated
face
of
this
chief
who
although
of
slighter
physique
and
lower
stature
than
his
compeers
wielded
by
reason
of
his
more
intellectual
qualities
so
potent
an
influence
among
them
the
oratorical
gifts
of
atta
kulla
kulla
had
signally
impressed
europeans
of
culture
and
experience
imagine
then
the
effect
on
the
raw
young
highland
soldier
hearing
the
flow
of
language
watching
the
appropriate
and
forceful
gestures
noting
the
responsive
sentiment
in
the
fire
lit
countenances
of
the
circle
of
feather
crested
indians
yet
comprehending
little
save
that
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
cogent
reasoning
richly
eloquent
and
that
every
word
was
as
a
fagot
to
the
flames
and
a
pang
to
the
torture
attusah
of
kanootare
the
northward
warrior
rose
to
reply
in
defense
of
himself
and
his
captive
and
atta
kulla
kulla
listened
as
courteously
as
the
rest
although
the
speech
of
the
ada
wehi
depended
like
the
oratory
of
many
young
men
chiefly
on
a
magical
assurance
he
had
an
ally
however
in
the
dominant
superstition
of
the
cherokees
numbers
of
the
warriors
now
ascribed
their
recent
disasters
to
the
neglect
of
various
omens
or
the
omission
of
certain
propitiatory
observances
of
their
ancient
religion
or
the
perpetration
of
deeds
known
to
be
adversely
regarded
by
the
ruling
spirits
of
war
moreover
they
were
all
aware
that
this
man
had
been
killed
left
for
dead
reported
as
dead
to
the
british
government
which
accepted
the
satisfaction
thus
offered
for
his
crimes
the
deeds
themselves
however
accounted
by
him
and
the
rest
of
the
tribe
praiseworthy
and
the
achievements
of
war
and
here
he
was
protesting
that
he
was
dead
and
a
ghost
akee
o
hoosa
akee
o
hoosa
tsida
wei
yu
he
cried
continually
indeed
this
seemed
to
be
the
only
reasonable
method
of
accounting
for
the
renewed
presence
in
the
world
of
a
man
known
to
be
dead
this
was
his
status
he
argued
he
was
a
dead
man
and
this
was
his
captive
the
cherokee
nation
could
not
pretend
to
follow
with
its
control
the
actions
of
a
dead
man
they
themselves
had
pronounced
him
dead
he
had
no
place
in
the
war
he
had
been
forbidden
on
account
of
his
official
death
to
compete
for
the
honors
of
the
campaign
apart
from
his
former
status
as
a
cherokee
merely
as
a
supernatural
being
a
spirit
an
ada
wehi
he
had
captured
this
british
soldier
who
was
therefore
the
property
of
a
dead
man
and
the
cherokee
law
of
all
things
and
before
all
things
forbade
interference
with
the
effects
of
the
dead
despite
the
curling
contempt
on
the
lip
of
atta
kulla
kulla
the
council
did
not
immediately
acquiesce
in
his
view
and
thus
for
a
time
flattered
the
hope
of
the
ada
wehi
that
they
were
resting
in
suspension
on
the
details
of
this
choice
argument
there
was
an
illogical
inversion
of
values
in
the
experience
of
the
tribe
and
while
they
could
not
now
accept
the
worthless
figments
of
long
ago
it
was
not
vouchsafed
to
them
to
enjoy
the
substantial
merits
of
the
new
order
of
things
reason
powder
diplomacy
had
brought
the
cherokee
nation
to
a
point
of
humiliation
to
which
superstition
savagery
and
the
simplicities
of
the
tomahawk
had
never
descended
in
the
good
old
times
reason
was
never
so
befuddled
of
aspect
civilization
never
so
undesired
as
now
in
their
own
expanded
outlook
at
life
however
they
could
not
afford
to
ignore
the
views
of
atta
kulla
kulla
the
advocate
of
all
the
newer
methods
in
so
important
a
matter
as
the
release
of
a
british
prisoner
of
war
on
the
strange
pretext
that
his
captor
was
a
ghost
of
a
peculiar
spectral
a
leap
like
a
mad
thing
the
man
was
connor
connor
the
boss
of
the
loading
gang
the
man
who
had
seduced
his
wife
who
had
sent
him
to
prison
and
wrecked
his
home
ruined
his
life
he
stood
there
staring
with
the
light
shining
full
upon
him
jurgis
had
often
thought
of
connor
since
coming
back
to
packingtown
but
it
had
been
as
of
something
far
off
that
no
longer
concerned
him
now
however
when
he
saw
him
alive
and
in
the
flesh
the
same
thing
happened
to
him
that
had
happened
before
a
flood
of
rage
boiled
up
in
him
a
blind
frenzy
seized
him
and
he
flung
himself
at
the
man
and
smote
him
between
the
eyes
and
then
as
he
fell
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
began
to
pound
his
head
upon
the
stones
the
woman
began
screaming
and
people
came
rushing
in
the
lantern
had
been
upset
and
extinguished
and
it
was
so
dark
they
could
not
see
a
thing
but
they
could
hear
jurgis
panting
and
hear
the
thumping
of
his
victim
s
skull
and
they
rushed
there
and
tried
to
pull
him
off
precisely
as
before
jurgis
came
away
with
a
piece
of
his
enemy
s
flesh
between
his
teeth
and
as
before
he
went
on
fighting
with
those
who
had
interfered
with
him
until
a
policeman
had
come
and
beaten
him
into
insensibility
and
so
jurgis
spent
the
balance
of
the
night
in
the
stockyards
station
house
this
time
however
he
had
money
in
his
pocket
and
when
he
came
to
his
senses
he
could
get
something
to
drink
and
also
a
messenger
to
take
word
of
his
plight
to
bush
harper
harper
did
not
appear
however
until
after
the
prisoner
feeling
very
weak
and
ill
had
been
hailed
into
court
and
remanded
at
five
hundred
dollars
bail
to
await
the
result
of
his
victim
s
injuries
jurgis
was
wild
about
this
because
a
different
magistrate
had
chanced
to
be
on
the
bench
and
he
had
stated
that
he
had
never
been
arrested
before
and
also
that
he
had
been
attacked
first
and
if
only
someone
had
been
there
to
speak
a
good
word
for
him
he
could
have
been
let
off
at
once
but
harper
explained
that
he
had
been
downtown
and
had
not
got
the
message
what
s
happened
to
you
he
asked
i
ve
been
doing
a
fellow
up
said
jurgis
and
i
ve
got
to
get
five
hundred
dollars
bail
i
can
arrange
that
all
right
said
the
other
though
it
may
cost
you
a
few
dollars
of
course
but
what
was
the
trouble
it
was
a
man
that
did
me
a
mean
trick
once
answered
jurgis
who
is
he
he
s
a
foreman
in
brown
s
or
used
to
be
his
name
s
connor
and
the
other
gave
a
start
connor
he
cried
not
phil
connor
yes
said
jurgis
that
s
the
fellow
why
good
god
exclaimed
the
other
then
you
re
in
for
it
old
man
i
ca
nt
help
you
not
help
me
why
not
why
he
s
one
of
scully
s
biggest
men
he
s
a
member
of
the
war
whoop
league
and
they
talked
of
sending
him
to
the
legislature
phil
connor
great
heavens
jurgis
sat
dumb
with
dismay
why
he
can
send
you
to
joliet
if
he
wants
to
declared
the
other
ca
nt
i
have
scully
get
me
off
before
he
finds
out
about
it
asked
jurgis
at
length
but
scully
s
out
of
town
the
other
answered
i
do
nt
even
know
where
he
is
he
s
run
away
to
dodge
the
strike
that
was
a
pretty
mess
indeed
poor
jurgis
sat
half
dazed
his
pull
had
run
up
against
a
bigger
pull
and
he
was
down
and
out
but
what
am
i
going
to
do
he
asked
weakly
how
should
i
know
said
the
other
i
should
nt
even
dare
to
get
bail
for
you
why
i
might
ruin
myself
for
life
again
there
was
silence
ca
nt
you
do
it
for
me
jurgis
asked
and
pretend
that
you
did
nt
know
who
i
d
hit
but
what
good
would
that
do
you
when
you
came
to
stand
trial
asked
harper
then
he
sat
buried
in
thought
for
a
minute
or
two
there
s
nothing
unless
it
s
this
he
said
i
could
have
your
bail
reduced
and
then
if
you
had
the
money
you
could
pay
it
and
skip
how
much
will
it
be
jurgis
asked
after
he
had
had
this
explained
more
in
detail
i
do
nt
know
said
the
other
how
much
do
you
own
i
ve
got
about
three
hundred
dollars
was
the
answer
well
was
harper
s
reply
i
m
not
sure
but
i
ll
try
and
get
you
off
for
that
i
ll
take
the
risk
for
friendship
s
sake
for
i
d
hate
to
see
you
sent
to
state
s
prison
for
a
year
or
two
and
so
finally
jurgis
ripped
out
his
bankbook
which
was
sewed
up
in
his
trousers
and
signed
an
order
which
bush
harper
wrote
for
all
the
money
to
be
paid
out
then
the
latter
went
and
got
it
and
hurried
to
the
court
and
explained
to
the
magistrate
that
jurgis
was
a
decent
fellow
and
a
friend
of
scully
s
who
had
been
attacked
by
a
strike
breaker
so
the
bail
was
reduced
to
three
hundred
dollars
and
harper
went
on
it
himself
he
did
not
tell
this
to
jurgis
however
nor
did
he
tell
him
that
when
the
time
for
trial
came
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
for
him
to
avoid
the
forfeiting
of
the
bail
and
pocket
the
three
hundred
dollars
as
his
reward
for
the
risk
of
offending
mike
scully
all
that
he
told
jurgis
was
that
he
was
now
free
and
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
clear
out
as
quickly
as
possible
and
so
jurgis
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
and
relief
took
the
dollar
and
fourteen
cents
even
excited
some
compunction
in
the
breast
of
benita
what
would
his
feelings
be
she
wondered
when
he
found
that
they
had
run
away
leaving
him
to
deal
with
their
joint
undertaking
single
handed
almost
was
she
minded
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
yet
and
this
was
a
curious
evidence
of
the
man
s
ascendancy
over
her
she
did
not
perhaps
she
felt
that
to
do
so
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
their
scheme
since
then
by
argument
blandishments
threats
force
or
appeal
to
their
sense
of
loyalty
it
mattered
not
which
he
would
bring
about
its
abandonment
but
she
wanted
to
fulfil
that
scheme
to
be
free
of
bambatse
its
immemorial
ruins
its
graveyard
cave
and
the
ghoul
jacob
meyer
who
could
delve
among
dead
bones
and
in
living
hearts
with
equal
skill
and
insight
and
yet
was
unable
to
find
the
treasure
that
lay
beneath
either
of
them
so
they
hid
the
truth
and
talked
with
feverish
activity
about
other
things
such
as
the
drilling
of
the
makalanga
and
the
chances
of
an
attack
by
the
matabele
which
happily
now
seemed
to
be
growing
small
also
of
the
conditions
of
their
cattle
and
the
prospect
of
obtaining
more
to
replace
those
that
had
died
indeed
benita
went
farther
in
her
new
found
zeal
of
deception
she
proceeded
to
act
a
lie
yes
even
with
her
father
s
reproachful
eyes
fixed
upon
her
incidentally
she
mentioned
that
they
were
going
to
have
an
outing
to
climb
down
the
ladder
and
visit
the
makalanga
camp
between
the
first
and
second
walls
and
mix
with
the
great
world
for
a
few
hours
also
to
carry
their
washing
to
be
done
there
and
bring
up
some
clean
clothes
and
certain
books
which
she
had
left
below
jacob
came
out
of
his
thoughts
and
calculations
and
listened
gloomily
i
have
half
a
mind
to
come
with
you
he
said
words
at
which
benita
shivered
it
certainly
is
most
cursed
lonesome
in
that
cave
and
i
seem
to
hear
things
in
it
as
though
those
old
bones
were
rattling
sounds
like
sighs
and
whispers
too
which
are
made
by
the
draught
well
why
do
nt
you
asked
benita
it
was
a
bold
stroke
but
it
succeeded
if
he
had
any
doubts
they
vanished
and
he
answered
at
once
because
i
have
not
the
time
we
have
to
get
this
business
finished
one
way
or
another
before
the
wet
season
comes
on
and
we
are
drowned
out
of
the
place
with
rain
or
rotted
by
fever
take
your
afternoon
out
miss
clifford
every
maid
of
all
work
is
entitled
to
as
much
and
i
am
afraid
that
is
your
billet
here
only
he
added
with
that
care
for
her
safety
which
he
always
showed
in
his
more
temperate
moods
pray
be
careful
clifford
to
get
back
before
sundown
that
wall
is
too
risky
for
your
daughter
to
climb
in
the
dusk
call
me
from
the
foot
of
it
you
have
the
whistle
and
i
will
come
down
to
help
her
up
i
think
i
ll
go
with
you
after
all
no
i
wo
nt
i
made
myself
so
unpleasant
to
them
yesterday
that
those
makalanga
ca
nt
wish
to
see
any
more
of
me
at
present
i
hope
you
will
have
a
more
agreeable
afternoon
than
i
shall
why
do
nt
you
take
a
ride
outside
the
wall
your
horses
are
fat
and
want
exercise
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
need
be
afraid
of
the
matabele
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
rose
and
left
them
mr
clifford
looked
after
him
doubtfully
oh
i
know
said
benita
it
seems
horribly
mean
but
one
must
do
shabby
things
sometimes
here
are
the
bundles
all
ready
so
let
us
be
off
accordingly
they
went
and
from
the
top
of
the
wall
benita
glanced
back
to
bid
goodbye
to
that
place
which
she
hoped
never
to
see
again
yet
she
could
not
feel
as
though
she
looked
her
last
upon
it
to
her
it
wore
no
air
of
farewell
and
even
as
she
descended
the
perilous
stairs
she
found
herself
making
mental
notes
as
to
how
they
might
best
be
climbed
again
also
she
could
not
believe
that
she
had
done
with
mr
meyer
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
for
a
long
while
yet
her
future
would
be
full
of
him
they
reached
the
outer
fortifications
in
safety
and
there
were
greeted
with
some
surprise
but
with
no
displeasure
by
the
makalanga
whom
they
found
still
drilling
with
the
rifles
in
the
use
of
which
a
certain
number
of
them
appeared
to
have
become
fairly
proficient
going
to
the
hut
in
which
the
spare
goods
from
the
waggon
had
been
stored
they
quickly
made
their
preparations
here
also
mr
clifford
wrote
a
letter
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
that
he
had
ever
been
called
upon
to
compose
it
ran
thus
dear
meyer
i
do
nt
know
what
you
will
think
of
us
but
we
are
escaping
from
this
place
the
truth
is
that
i
am
not
well
and
my
daughter
can
bear
it
no
longer
she
says
that
if
she
stops
here
she
will
die
and
that
hunting
for
treasure
in
that
ghastly
grave
yard
is
shattering
her
nerves
i
should
have
liked
to
tell
you
but
she
begged
me
not
being
convinced
that
if
i
did
you
would
over
persuade
us
or
stop
us
in
some
way
as
for
the
gold
if
you
can
find
it
take
it
all
i
renounce
my
share
we
are
leaving
you
the
waggon
and
the
oxen
and
starting
down
country
on
our
horses
it
is
a
perilous
business
but
less
so
than
staying
here
under
the
circumstances
if
we
never
meet
again
we
hope
that
you
will
forgive
us
and
wish
you
all
good
fortune
yours
sincerely
and
with
much
regret
t
clifford
the
letter
written
they
saddled
the
horses
which
had
been
brought
up
for
their
inspection
and
were
found
to
be
in
me
and
a
glimmer
of
hope
it
might
not
have
made
any
difference
but
i
wish
to
god
i
had
known
it
before
drew
could
not
stand
the
misery
of
the
convulsed
face
he
turned
his
eyes
away
drew
filmer
had
risen
suddenly
and
now
confronted
his
companion
with
deep
flashing
eyes
drew
i
m
not
going
to
take
the
fortune
unless
i
m
fit
to
handle
it
i
ve
been
a
tramp
long
enough
to
know
that
i
can
keep
on
being
a
tramp
but
i
m
going
to
make
one
more
almighty
try
before
i
succumb
i
may
be
all
wrong
but
lately
i
ve
thought
the
the
motive
power
has
come
to
me
a
strange
uplifting
dignity
seemed
to
fall
upon
filmer
drew
tried
to
speak
to
say
the
right
thing
but
he
merely
smiled
feebly
and
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
i
would
nt
blame
you
if
you
cut
me
after
this
drew
but
it
s
got
to
be
said
it
s
your
sister
my
sister
connie
drew
was
never
so
surprised
and
astounded
in
his
life
before
connie
he
gasped
again
connie
if
if
i
was
what
i
might
be
if
i
come
into
my
own
drew
do
you
think
she
could
care
for
me
how
under
heaven
can
i
tell
drew
said
slowly
she
has
never
how
could
she
shown
he
paused
how
indeed
could
she
filmer
laughed
a
hard
bitter
laugh
it
would
be
a
poor
sort
of
reformation
jock
drew
was
getting
command
of
himself
if
it
were
only
to
get
her
you
ve
got
to
get
yourself
old
man
before
you
d
dare
ask
any
woman
to
care
for
you
i
often
think
the
best
of
us
ask
a
good
deal
on
trust
but
at
least
a
man
must
know
himself
before
he
has
a
right
to
expect
even
faith
oh
i
ve
worked
all
that
out
drew
i
ve
been
to
hillcrest
to
talk
the
beginnings
over
with
a
little
lawyer
fellow
who
s
had
my
confidence
all
along
i
m
going
back
where
i
fell
drew
in
the
start
i
m
going
back
there
where
the
loss
of
her
the
mother
s
laugh
and
song
will
grip
the
hardest
and
where
the
antidote
will
be
the
easiest
to
get
i
m
going
to
take
only
enough
of
the
governor
s
money
to
keep
me
out
of
the
filth
of
the
gutter
until
i
can
climb
on
to
the
curb
or
go
to
the
sewer
see
but
always
there
is
going
to
be
your
sister
above
me
just
remember
that
and
if
you
can
help
her
to
think
of
me
once
in
a
while
filmer
until
you
climb
up
you
must
not
ask
me
to
hold
even
one
thought
of
my
sister
s
for
you
except
and
here
drew
looked
frankly
in
the
anxious
face
except
as
the
good
fellow
of
our
solitude
thank
you
that
s
all
i
meant
and
if
i
pull
up
and
stay
up
she
not
i
will
know
how
to
use
the
money
she
s
got
the
heart
that
can
reach
down
to
the
suffering
and
hold
little
dying
kids
on
her
breast
if
i
go
under
drew
the
money
is
going
to
her
anyway
filmer
that
s
all
right
drew
i
know
what
i
m
about
she
ll
brighten
up
all
the
dark
places
and
remember
me
in
that
way
if
in
no
other
long
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
then
drew
extended
his
hand
jock
took
it
in
a
firm
grip
good
night
filmer
and
god
be
with
you
i
m
ready
to
start
i
ll
tramp
back
with
you
as
far
as
the
bungalow
jock
dashed
the
crumbling
glowing
logs
with
his
foot
and
left
the
fire
dying
but
safe
then
gathering
his
travelling
things
together
he
went
out
with
drew
closing
the
door
behind
him
it
was
a
snowy
night
now
white
and
dry
in
silence
the
two
trudged
on
to
the
bungalow
then
drew
said
and
you
wo
nt
come
in
filmer
just
for
a
word
thanks
no
where
are
you
going
now
to
hillcrest
i
start
from
there
to
morrow
morning
after
another
talk
with
the
little
fellow
i
mentioned
i
m
going
to
keep
to
the
woods
for
a
few
days
they
always
brace
me
then
i
m
going
to
make
a
break
for
the
coast
you
ll
write
to
me
jock
for
a
moment
filmer
hesitated
then
he
said
eagerly
yes
as
long
as
i
m
fighting
i
ll
keep
in
touch
if
i
get
down
you
ll
know
by
my
not
writing
and
drew
i
want
to
tell
you
something
that
religion
of
yours
is
all
right
it
was
the
first
kind
that
ever
got
into
my
system
and
stayed
there
it
s
got
iron
red
hot
iron
in
it
but
it
s
got
a
homelike
kind
of
friendliness
about
it
that
gives
you
heart
to
hope
in
this
life
and
let
the
next
life
take
care
of
itself
thank
you
filmer
that
s
going
to
make
me
fight
another
quick
strong
handclasp
and
then
drew
turned
toward
the
glowing
windows
of
his
home
filmer
stood
with
uncovered
head
in
the
driving
storm
and
looked
with
a
great
hungry
craving
up
to
the
house
that
held
the
motive
power
of
his
new
life
and
then
with
a
dull
pain
he
grimly
set
his
face
toward
the
coast
chapter
xix
drew
waited
until
after
christmas
before
he
took
a
decided
part
in
the
affairs
of
gaston
and
joyce
indeed
he
purposely
avoided
any
information
regarding
what
was
going
on
at
the
shack
among
the
pines
he
was
determined
that
st
ange
s
first
true
christmas
should
be
as
far
as
he
could
make
it
a
perfect
one
and
it
was
one
never
to
be
forgotten
it
set
a
high
standard
one
from
which
the
place
was
never
again
to
fall
far
below
the
snowstorm
raged
furiously
for
hours
and
then
the
weather
cleared
suddenly
and
only
marco
knew
this
he
said
to
loristan
with
appeal
in
his
voice
it
was
he
who
invented
the
game
said
loristan
i
showed
you
his
strange
maps
and
plans
it
is
a
good
game
the
prince
answered
in
the
manner
of
a
man
extraordinarily
interested
and
impressed
they
know
it
well
they
can
be
trusted
no
such
thing
has
ever
been
done
before
loristan
said
it
is
as
new
as
it
is
daring
and
simple
therein
lies
its
safety
the
prince
answered
perhaps
only
boyhood
said
loristan
could
have
dared
to
imagine
it
the
prince
thanks
you
he
said
after
a
few
more
words
spoken
aside
to
his
visitor
we
both
thank
you
you
may
go
back
to
your
beds
and
the
boys
went
xix
that
is
one
a
week
had
not
passed
before
marco
brought
to
the
rat
in
their
bedroom
an
envelope
containing
a
number
of
slips
of
paper
on
each
of
which
was
written
something
this
is
another
part
of
the
game
he
said
gravely
let
us
sit
down
together
by
the
table
and
study
it
they
sat
down
and
examined
what
was
written
on
the
slips
at
the
head
of
each
was
the
name
of
one
of
the
places
with
which
marco
had
connected
a
face
he
had
sketched
below
were
clear
and
concise
directions
as
to
how
it
was
to
be
reached
and
the
words
to
be
said
when
each
individual
was
encountered
this
person
is
to
be
found
at
his
stall
in
the
market
was
written
of
the
vacant
faced
peasant
you
will
first
attract
his
attention
by
asking
the
price
of
something
when
he
is
looking
at
you
touch
your
left
thumb
lightly
with
the
forefinger
of
your
right
hand
then
utter
in
a
low
distinct
tone
the
words
the
lamp
is
lighted
that
is
all
you
are
to
do
sometimes
the
directions
were
not
quite
so
simple
but
they
were
all
instructions
of
the
same
order
the
originals
of
the
sketches
were
to
be
sought
out
always
with
precaution
which
should
conceal
that
they
were
being
sought
at
all
and
always
in
such
a
manner
as
would
cause
an
encounter
to
appear
to
be
mere
chance
then
certain
words
were
to
be
uttered
but
always
without
attracting
the
attention
of
any
bystander
or
passer
by
the
boys
worked
at
their
task
through
the
entire
day
they
concentrated
all
their
powers
upon
it
they
wrote
and
re
wrote
they
repeated
to
each
other
what
they
committed
to
memory
as
if
it
were
a
lesson
marco
worked
with
the
greater
ease
and
more
rapidly
because
exercise
of
this
order
had
been
his
practice
and
entertainment
from
his
babyhood
the
rat
however
almost
kept
pace
with
him
as
he
had
been
born
with
a
phenomenal
memory
and
his
eagerness
and
desire
were
a
fury
but
throughout
the
entire
day
neither
of
them
once
referred
to
what
they
were
doing
as
anything
but
the
game
at
night
it
is
true
each
found
himself
lying
awake
and
thinking
it
was
the
rat
who
broke
the
silence
from
his
sofa
it
is
what
the
messengers
of
the
secret
party
would
be
ordered
to
do
when
they
were
sent
out
to
give
the
sign
for
the
rising
he
said
i
made
that
up
the
first
day
i
invented
the
party
did
nt
i
yes
answered
marco
after
a
third
day
s
concentration
they
knew
by
heart
everything
given
to
them
to
learn
that
night
loristan
put
them
through
an
examination
can
you
write
these
things
he
asked
after
each
had
repeated
them
and
emerged
safely
from
all
cross
questioning
each
boy
wrote
them
correctly
from
memory
write
yours
in
french
in
german
in
russian
in
samavian
loristan
said
to
marco
all
you
have
told
me
to
do
and
to
learn
is
part
of
myself
father
marco
said
in
the
end
it
is
part
of
me
as
if
it
were
my
hand
or
my
eyes
or
my
heart
i
believe
that
is
true
answered
loristan
he
was
pale
that
night
and
there
was
a
shadow
on
his
face
his
eyes
held
a
great
longing
as
they
rested
on
marco
it
was
a
yearning
which
had
a
sort
of
dread
in
it
lazarus
also
did
not
seem
quite
himself
he
was
red
instead
of
pale
and
his
movements
were
uncertain
and
restless
he
cleared
his
throat
nervously
at
intervals
and
more
than
once
left
his
chair
as
if
to
look
for
something
it
was
almost
midnight
when
loristan
standing
near
marco
put
his
arm
round
his
shoulders
the
game
he
began
and
then
was
silent
a
few
moments
while
marco
felt
his
arm
tighten
its
hold
both
marco
and
the
rat
felt
a
hard
quick
beat
in
their
breasts
and
because
of
this
and
because
the
pause
seemed
long
marco
spoke
the
game
yes
father
he
said
the
game
is
about
to
give
you
work
to
do
both
of
you
loristan
answered
lazarus
cleared
his
throat
and
walked
to
the
easel
in
the
corner
of
the
room
but
he
only
changed
the
position
of
a
piece
of
drawing
paper
on
it
and
then
came
back
in
two
days
you
are
to
go
to
paris
as
you
to
the
rat
planned
in
the
game
as
i
planned
the
rat
barely
breathed
the
words
yes
answered
loristan
the
instructions
you
have
learned
you
will
carry
out
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
than
to
manage
to
approach
certain
persons
closely
enough
to
be
able
to
utter
certain
words
to
them
only
two
young
strollers
whom
no
man
could
suspect
put
in
lazarus
in
an
astonishingly
rough
and
shaky
voice
they
could
pass
near
the
emperor
himself
without
danger
the
young
master
his
voice
became
so
hoarse
that
he
was
obligated
to
clear
it
loudly
the
young
master
must
carry
himself
less
finely
it
would
be
well
to
shuffle
a
little
and
slouch
as
if
he
were
of
the
common
people
yes
said
the
rat
hastily
he
must
do
that
i
can
voices
were
lost
in
the
general
shouting
wonderful
said
doris
at
last
looking
up
from
the
last
of
these
epistles
i
really
did
nt
know
arthur
you
were
such
a
great
man
her
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
fond
but
rather
puzzled
expression
well
of
course
dear
you
ve
always
seen
the
seamy
side
of
me
said
meadows
with
the
slightest
change
of
tone
and
a
laugh
perhaps
now
you
ll
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
m
not
always
lazy
when
i
seem
so
that
a
man
must
have
time
to
think
and
smoke
and
dawdle
if
he
s
to
write
anything
decent
and
ca
nt
always
rush
at
the
first
job
that
offers
when
you
thought
i
was
idling
i
was
nt
i
was
gathering
up
impressions
then
came
an
attractive
piece
of
work
one
that
suited
me
and
i
rose
to
it
there
you
see
he
threw
back
his
jovian
head
with
a
look
at
his
wife
half
combative
half
merry
doris
s
forehead
puckered
a
little
well
thank
heaven
that
it
has
turned
out
well
she
said
with
a
deep
breath
where
we
should
have
been
if
it
had
nt
i
m
sure
i
do
nt
know
and
as
it
is
by
the
way
arthur
have
you
got
that
packet
ready
for
new
york
her
tone
was
quick
and
anxious
what
the
proofs
of
dizzy
oh
goodness
that
ll
do
any
time
do
nt
bother
doris
i
m
really
rather
done
and
this
post
is
well
upon
my
word
it
s
overwhelming
and
gathering
up
the
letters
he
threw
himself
with
an
air
of
fatigue
into
a
long
chair
his
hands
behind
his
head
perhaps
after
tea
and
a
cigarette
i
shall
feel
more
fit
arthur
you
know
to
morrow
is
the
last
day
for
catching
the
new
york
mail
well
hang
it
if
i
do
nt
catch
it
they
must
wait
that
s
all
said
meadows
peevishly
if
they
wo
nt
take
it
somebody
else
will
they
represented
the
editor
and
publisher
of
a
famous
new
york
magazine
who
had
agreed
by
cable
to
give
a
large
sum
for
the
dizzy
lecture
provided
it
reached
them
by
a
certain
date
doris
twisted
her
lip
arthur
do
think
of
the
bills
darling
do
nt
be
a
nuisance
if
i
succeed
i
shall
make
money
and
if
this
is
nt
a
success
i
do
nt
know
what
is
he
pointed
to
the
letters
on
his
lap
an
impatient
gesture
which
dislodged
a
certain
number
of
them
so
that
they
came
rustling
to
the
floor
hullo
here
s
one
you
have
nt
opened
another
coronet
gracious
i
believe
it
s
the
woman
who
asked
us
to
dinner
a
fortnight
ago
and
we
could
nt
go
meadows
sat
up
with
a
jerk
all
languor
dispelled
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
lady
dunstable
by
george
i
thought
she
d
ask
us
though
you
do
nt
deserve
it
doris
for
you
did
nt
take
any
trouble
at
all
about
her
first
invitation
we
were
engaged
cried
doris
interrupting
him
her
eyebrows
mounting
we
could
have
got
out
of
it
perfectly
but
now
listen
to
this
dear
mr
meadows
i
hope
your
wife
will
excuse
my
writing
to
you
instead
of
to
her
as
you
and
i
are
already
acquainted
can
i
induce
you
both
to
come
to
crosby
ledgers
for
a
week
end
on
july
we
hope
to
have
a
pleasant
party
a
diplomat
or
two
the
home
secretary
and
general
hichen
perhaps
some
others
you
would
i
am
sure
admire
our
hill
country
and
i
should
like
to
show
you
some
of
the
precious
autographs
we
have
inherited
yours
sincerely
rachel
dunstable
if
your
wife
brings
a
maid
perhaps
she
will
kindly
let
me
know
doris
laughed
and
the
amused
scorn
of
her
laugh
annoyed
her
husband
however
at
that
moment
their
small
house
parlourmaid
entered
with
the
tea
tray
and
doris
rose
to
make
a
place
for
it
the
parlourmaid
put
it
down
with
much
unnecessary
noise
and
doris
looking
at
her
in
alarm
saw
that
her
expression
was
sulky
and
her
eyes
red
when
the
girl
had
departed
mrs
meadows
said
with
resignation
there
that
one
will
give
me
notice
to
morrow
well
i
m
sure
you
could
easily
get
a
better
said
her
husband
sharply
doris
shook
her
head
the
fourth
in
six
months
she
said
sighing
and
she
really
is
a
good
girl
i
suppose
as
usual
she
complains
of
me
the
voice
was
that
of
an
injured
man
yes
dear
she
does
they
all
do
you
give
them
a
lot
of
extra
work
already
and
all
these
things
you
have
been
buying
lately
oh
arthur
if
you
would
nt
buy
things
mean
more
work
you
know
that
copper
coal
scuttle
you
sent
in
yesterday
well
is
nt
it
a
beauty
a
real
georgian
piece
cried
meadows
indignantly
i
dare
say
it
is
but
it
has
to
be
cleaned
when
it
arrived
jane
came
to
see
me
in
this
room
shut
the
door
and
put
her
back
against
it
there
s
another
of
them
beastly
copper
coal
scuttles
come
you
should
have
seen
her
eyes
blazing
and
i
should
like
to
know
ma
am
who
s
going
to
clean
it
cos
i
ca
nt
and
i
just
had
to
promise
her
it
might
go
dirty
lazy
minx
said
meadows
good
humouredly
with
his
mouth
full
of
tea
cake
at
last
i
have
something
good
to
look
at
in
this
room
he
turned
his
eyes
caressingly
towards
the
new
coal
scuttle
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
clean
it
myself
doris
laughed
again
this
time
almost
hysterically
but
was
checked
by
a
fresh
entrance
of
jane
who
with
an
air
of
defiance
deposited
a
heavy
parcel
on
a
chair
beside
her
mistress
and
flounced
out
again
what
is
this
said
doris
in
consternation
books
more
books
heavens
arthur
what
have
you
been
ordering
now
i
could
nt
sleep
last
night
for
thinking
all
than
rousseau
s
plan
of
educating
emile
which
certainly
obtained
a
wide
hearing
and
considerable
support
in
its
time
no
tempting
as
it
would
be
it
would
be
difficult
to
carry
out
such
a
theory
in
these
days
of
logic
and
common
sense
and
in
some
moment
of
weakness
i
might
possibly
succumb
and
tell
her
all
about
it
for
fear
that
some
stranger
whom
she
might
meet
at
a
ball
would
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
it
first
the
next
best
woman
person
in
the
world
with
whom
to
see
venice
barring
the
lovely
non
existent
daughter
is
salemina
it
is
our
first
visit
but
alas
we
are
nevertheless
much
better
informed
than
i
could
wish
salemina
s
mind
is
particularly
well
furnished
but
luckily
she
cannot
always
remember
the
point
wished
for
at
the
precise
moment
of
need
so
that
taking
her
all
in
all
she
is
nearly
as
agreeable
as
if
she
were
ignorant
her
knowledge
never
bulks
heavily
and
insistently
in
the
foreground
or
middle
distance
like
that
of
miss
celia
van
tyck
but
remains
as
it
should
in
the
haze
of
a
melting
and
delicious
perspective
she
has
plenty
of
enthusiasms
too
and
miss
van
tyck
has
none
imagine
our
plight
at
being
accidentally
linked
to
that
encyclopaedic
lady
in
italy
she
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
salemina
s
and
joined
us
in
florence
where
she
had
been
staying
for
a
month
waiting
for
her
niece
kitty
schuyler
kitty
copley
now
who
is
in
spain
with
her
husband
miss
van
tyck
would
be
endurable
in
sheffield
glasgow
lyons
genoa
kansas
city
pompeii
or
pittsburg
but
she
should
never
have
blighted
venice
with
her
presence
she
insisted
however
on
accompanying
us
and
i
can
only
hope
that
the
climate
and
associations
will
have
a
relaxing
effect
on
her
habits
of
thought
and
speech
when
she
was
in
florence
she
was
so
busy
in
reading
up
verona
and
padua
that
she
had
no
time
for
the
uffizi
gallery
in
verona
and
padua
she
was
absorbed
in
hare
s
venice
vaccinating
herself
so
to
speak
with
information
that
it
might
not
steal
upon
and
infect
her
unawares
if
there
is
anything
that
miss
van
abhors
it
is
knowing
a
thing
without
knowing
that
she
knows
it
while
for
me
the
most
charming
knowledge
is
the
sort
that
comes
by
unconscious
absorption
like
the
free
grace
of
god
we
intended
to
enter
venice
in
orthodox
fashion
by
moonlight
and
began
to
consult
about
trains
when
we
were
in
milan
the
porter
said
that
there
was
only
one
train
between
the
eight
and
the
twelve
and
gave
me
a
pamphlet
on
the
subject
but
salemina
objects
to
an
early
start
and
miss
van
refuses
to
arrive
anywhere
after
dusk
so
it
is
fortunate
that
the
distances
are
not
great
they
have
a
curious
way
of
reckoning
time
in
italy
for
i
found
that
the
train
leaving
milan
at
eight
thirty
was
scheduled
to
arrive
at
ten
minutes
past
eighteen
you
could
never
sit
up
until
then
miss
van
i
said
but
on
the
other
hand
if
we
leave
later
to
please
salemina
say
at
ten
in
the
morning
we
do
not
arrive
until
eight
minutes
before
twenty
one
i
have
nt
the
faintest
idea
what
time
that
will
really
be
but
it
sounds
too
late
for
three
defenceless
women
all
of
them
unmarried
to
be
prowling
about
in
a
strange
city
it
proved
on
investigation
however
that
twenty
one
o
clock
is
only
nine
in
christian
language
that
is
one
s
mother
tongue
so
we
united
in
choosing
that
hour
as
being
the
most
romantic
possible
and
there
was
a
full
yellow
moon
as
we
arrived
in
the
railway
station
my
heart
beat
high
with
joy
and
excitement
for
i
succeeded
in
establishing
miss
van
with
salemina
in
one
gondola
while
i
took
all
the
luggage
in
another
ridding
myself
thus
cleverly
of
the
disenchanting
influence
of
miss
van
s
company
do
come
with
us
penelope
she
said
as
we
issued
from
the
portico
of
the
station
and
heard
instead
of
the
usual
cab
drivers
pandemonium
only
the
soft
lapping
of
waves
against
the
marble
steps
do
come
with
us
penelope
and
let
us
enter
dangerous
and
sweet
charmed
venice
together
it
does
indeed
look
a
veritable
sea
bird
s
nest
she
had
informed
me
before
in
milan
that
cassiodorus
theodoric
s
secretary
had
thus
styled
venice
but
somehow
her
slightest
remark
is
out
of
key
i
can
always
see
it
printed
in
small
type
in
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
i
always
wish
to
skip
it
as
i
do
other
footnotes
and
annotations
and
marginal
notes
and
addenda
if
miss
van
s
mother
had
only
thought
of
it
addenda
would
have
been
a
delightful
christian
name
for
her
and
much
more
appropriate
than
celia
if
i
should
be
asked
on
bended
knees
if
i
should
be
reminded
that
every
intelligent
and
sympathetic
creature
brings
a
pair
of
fresh
eyes
to
the
study
of
the
beautiful
if
it
should
be
affirmed
that
the
new
note
is
as
likely
to
be
struck
by
the
prentice
as
by
the
master
hand
if
i
should
be
assured
that
my
diary
would
never
be
read
i
should
still
refuse
to
write
my
first
impressions
of
venice
my
best
successes
in
life
have
been
achieved
by
knowing
what
not
to
do
and
i
consider
it
the
finest
common
sense
to
step
modestly
along
in
beaten
paths
not
stirring
up
even
there
any
more
dust
than
is
necessary
if
my
friends
and
acquaintances
ever
go
to
venice
let
them
read
their
ruskin
their
goethe
their
byron
shelley
and
wordsworth
their
rogers
gautier
michelet
their
symonds
and
howells
not
forgetting
old
coryat
s
crudities
and
be
thankful
i
spared
them
mine
it
was
the
eve
of
ascension
day
and
a
yellow
may
moon
was
hanging
in
the
blue
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
that
it
were
a
little
matter
of
seven
extending
as
far
as
her
eye
could
reach
she
saw
bits
of
forest
verdure
clothed
hills
fields
of
waving
grain
fountains
rivers
and
lakes
and
throughout
the
scene
were
scattered
groups
of
pretty
houses
and
a
few
grand
castles
and
palaces
over
all
this
delightful
landscape
which
from
trot
s
high
perch
seemed
like
a
magnificent
painted
picture
was
a
rosy
glow
such
as
we
sometimes
see
in
the
west
at
sunset
in
this
case
however
it
was
not
in
the
west
only
but
everywhere
no
wonder
the
ork
paused
to
circle
slowly
over
this
lovely
country
the
other
birds
followed
his
action
all
eyeing
the
place
with
equal
delight
then
as
with
one
accord
the
four
formed
a
group
and
slowly
sailed
downward
this
brought
them
to
that
part
of
the
newly
discovered
land
which
bordered
on
the
desert
s
edge
but
it
was
just
as
pretty
here
as
anywhere
so
the
ork
and
the
birds
alighted
and
the
three
passengers
at
once
got
out
of
their
swings
oh
cap
n
bill
is
nt
this
fine
an
dandy
exclaimed
trot
rapturously
how
lucky
we
were
to
discover
this
beautiful
country
the
country
seems
rather
high
class
i
ll
admit
trot
replied
the
old
sailor
man
looking
around
him
but
we
do
nt
know
as
yet
what
its
people
are
like
no
one
could
live
in
such
a
country
without
being
happy
and
good
i
m
sure
of
that
she
said
earnestly
do
nt
you
think
so
button
bright
i
m
not
thinking
just
now
answered
the
little
boy
it
tires
me
to
think
and
i
never
seem
to
gain
anything
by
it
when
we
see
the
people
who
live
here
we
will
know
what
they
are
like
and
no
mount
of
thinking
will
make
them
any
different
that
s
true
enough
said
the
ork
but
now
i
want
to
make
a
proposal
while
you
are
getting
acquainted
with
this
new
country
which
looks
as
if
it
contains
everything
to
make
one
happy
i
would
like
to
fly
along
all
by
myself
and
see
if
i
can
find
my
home
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
desert
if
i
do
i
will
stay
there
of
course
but
if
i
fail
to
find
orkland
i
will
return
to
you
in
a
week
to
see
if
i
can
do
anything
more
to
assist
you
they
were
sorry
to
lose
their
queer
companion
but
could
offer
no
objection
to
the
plan
so
the
ork
bade
them
good
bye
and
rising
swiftly
in
the
air
he
flew
over
the
country
and
was
soon
lost
to
view
in
the
distance
the
three
birds
which
had
carried
our
friends
now
begged
permission
to
return
by
the
way
they
had
come
to
their
own
homes
saying
they
were
anxious
to
show
their
families
how
big
they
had
become
so
cap
n
bill
and
trot
and
button
bright
all
thanked
them
gratefully
for
their
assistance
and
soon
the
birds
began
their
long
flight
toward
the
land
of
mo
being
now
left
to
themselves
in
this
strange
land
the
three
comrades
selected
a
pretty
pathway
and
began
walking
along
it
they
believed
this
path
would
lead
them
to
a
splendid
castle
which
they
espied
in
the
distance
the
turrets
of
which
towered
far
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
which
surrounded
it
it
did
not
seem
very
far
away
so
they
sauntered
on
slowly
admiring
the
beautiful
ferns
and
flowers
that
lined
the
pathway
and
listening
to
the
singing
of
the
birds
and
the
soft
chirping
of
the
grasshoppers
presently
the
path
wound
over
a
little
hill
in
a
valley
that
lay
beyond
the
hill
was
a
tiny
cottage
surrounded
by
flower
beds
and
fruit
trees
on
the
shady
porch
of
the
cottage
they
saw
as
they
approached
a
pleasant
faced
woman
sitting
amidst
a
group
of
children
to
whom
she
was
telling
stories
the
children
quickly
discovered
the
strangers
and
ran
toward
them
with
exclamations
of
astonishment
so
that
trot
and
her
friends
became
the
center
of
a
curious
group
all
chattering
excitedly
cap
n
bill
s
wooden
leg
seemed
to
arouse
the
wonder
of
the
children
as
they
could
not
understand
why
he
had
not
two
meat
legs
this
attention
seemed
to
please
the
old
sailor
who
patted
the
heads
of
the
children
kindly
and
then
raising
his
hat
to
the
woman
he
inquired
can
you
tell
us
madam
just
what
country
this
is
she
stared
hard
at
all
three
of
the
strangers
as
she
replied
briefly
jinxland
oh
exclaimed
cap
n
bill
with
a
puzzled
look
and
where
is
jinxland
please
in
the
quadling
country
said
she
what
cried
trot
in
sudden
excitement
do
you
mean
to
say
this
is
the
quadling
country
of
the
land
of
oz
to
be
sure
i
do
the
woman
answered
every
bit
of
land
that
is
surrounded
by
the
great
desert
is
the
land
of
oz
as
you
ought
to
know
as
well
as
i
do
but
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
jinxland
is
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
quadling
country
by
that
row
of
high
mountains
you
see
yonder
which
have
such
steep
sides
that
no
one
can
cross
them
so
we
live
here
all
by
ourselves
and
are
ruled
by
our
own
king
instead
of
by
ozma
of
oz
i
ve
been
to
the
land
of
oz
before
said
button
bright
but
i
ve
never
been
here
did
you
ever
hear
of
jinxland
before
asked
trot
no
said
button
bright
it
is
on
the
map
of
oz
though
asserted
the
woman
and
it
s
a
fine
country
i
assure
you
if
only
she
added
and
then
paused
to
look
around
her
with
a
frightened
expression
if
only
here
she
stopped
again
as
if
not
daring
to
go
on
with
her
speech
if
only
what
ma
am
asked
cap
n
bill
the
woman
sent
the
children
into
the
house
then
she
came
closer
to
the
strangers
and
whispered
if
only
we
had
a
different
king
we
but
still
quite
tolerable
ewen
hooper
he
vowed
was
a
magnificent
scholar
and
it
was
too
bad
that
oxford
had
found
nothing
better
for
him
than
a
scrubby
readership
but
some
day
of
course
he
ll
have
the
regius
professorship
nora
was
a
plucky
little
thing
though
she
hates
me
and
he
falloden
was
not
so
sure
after
all
that
miss
alice
would
not
land
her
pryce
ca
nt
we
bring
it
about
and
falloden
ran
laughing
through
a
catalogue
of
his
own
smart
or
powerful
relations
speculating
what
could
be
done
it
was
true
was
nt
it
that
pryce
was
anxious
to
turn
his
back
on
oxford
and
the
higher
mathematics
and
to
try
his
luck
in
journalism
or
politics
well
falloden
happened
to
know
that
an
attractive
post
in
the
conservative
central
office
would
soon
be
vacant
an
uncle
of
his
was
a
very
important
person
on
the
council
that
and
other
wires
might
be
pulled
constance
eagerly
began
to
count
up
her
own
opportunities
of
the
same
kind
and
between
them
they
had
soon
in
imagination
captured
the
post
then
said
falloden
it
would
be
for
constance
to
clinch
the
matter
no
man
could
do
such
a
thing
decently
pryce
would
have
to
be
told
the
world
s
your
oyster
but
before
you
open
it
you
will
kindly
go
and
propose
to
my
cousin
which
of
course
you
ought
to
have
done
months
ago
and
so
laughing
and
plotting
like
a
couple
of
children
they
had
gone
rambling
through
the
green
rides
and
glades
of
the
wood
occasionally
putting
their
horses
to
the
gallop
that
the
pulse
of
life
might
run
still
faster
but
a
later
topic
of
conversation
had
brought
them
into
even
closer
contact
connie
spoke
of
her
proposed
visit
to
her
aunts
falloden
radiant
could
not
conceal
his
delight
you
will
be
only
five
miles
from
us
of
course
you
must
come
and
stay
at
flood
my
mother
writes
they
have
collected
a
jolly
party
for
the
th
i
will
tell
her
to
write
to
you
at
once
you
must
come
you
must
will
you
promise
and
constance
wondering
at
her
own
docility
had
practically
promised
i
want
you
to
know
my
people
i
want
you
to
know
my
father
and
as
he
plunged
again
into
talk
about
his
father
the
egotistical
man
of
fashion
disappeared
she
seemed
at
last
to
have
reached
something
sincere
and
soft
and
true
and
then
what
had
begun
the
jarring
was
it
first
her
account
of
her
greek
lessons
with
sorell
before
she
knew
what
had
happened
the
brow
beside
her
had
clouded
the
voice
had
changed
why
did
she
see
so
much
of
sorell
he
like
radowitz
was
a
poseur
a
wind
bag
that
was
what
made
the
attraction
between
them
if
she
wished
to
learn
greek
let
me
teach
you
and
he
had
bent
forward
with
his
most
brilliant
and
imperious
look
his
hand
upon
her
reins
but
constance
surprised
and
ruffled
had
protested
that
sorell
had
been
her
mother
s
dear
friend
and
was
now
her
own
she
could
not
and
would
not
give
up
her
lessons
why
indeed
should
she
because
friends
falloden
had
laid
a
passionate
emphasis
on
the
word
must
have
some
regard
surely
to
each
other
s
likes
and
dislikes
if
you
have
an
enemy
tell
me
he
or
she
shall
be
mine
instantly
sorell
dislikes
me
you
will
never
hear
any
good
of
me
from
him
and
of
course
radowitz
hates
me
i
have
given
him
good
cause
promise
at
least
that
you
will
not
dance
with
radowitz
again
you
do
nt
know
what
i
suffered
last
night
he
has
the
antics
of
a
monkey
whereupon
the
quarrel
between
them
had
broken
like
thunder
constance
denouncing
the
arrogance
and
unkindness
that
could
ask
such
promises
of
her
falloden
steadily
and
with
increasing
bitterness
pressing
his
demand
and
so
to
the
last
scene
between
them
at
the
gate
was
it
a
breach
or
would
it
all
be
made
up
that
very
night
at
the
magdalen
ball
no
it
was
and
should
be
a
breach
constance
fought
back
her
tears
and
rode
proudly
home
what
are
you
going
to
wear
to
night
said
nora
putting
her
head
in
at
constance
s
door
constance
was
lying
down
by
annette
s
strict
command
in
preparation
for
her
second
ball
which
was
being
given
by
magdalen
where
the
college
was
reported
to
have
surpassed
itself
in
the
lavishness
of
all
the
preparations
made
for
lighting
up
its
beautiful
walks
and
quadrangles
constance
pointed
languidly
to
the
sofa
where
a
creation
in
white
silk
and
tulle
just
arrived
from
london
had
been
laid
out
by
the
reverential
hands
of
annette
why
on
earth
does
one
go
to
balls
said
constance
gloomily
pressing
both
hands
upon
a
pair
of
aching
temples
nora
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
came
to
the
side
of
the
bed
it
s
time
to
dress
she
said
firmly
alice
says
you
had
a
succs
fou
last
night
go
away
and
do
nt
talk
nonsense
constance
turned
on
her
side
and
shut
her
eyes
oh
alice
had
nt
a
bad
time
either
said
nora
complacently
sitting
on
the
bed
herbert
pryce
seems
to
have
behaved
quite
decently
shall
i
tell
you
something
the
laughing
girl
stooped
over
connie
and
said
in
her
ear
now
that
herbert
knows
it
would
be
no
good
proposing
to
you
he
thinks
it
might
be
a
useful
thing
to
have
you
for
a
relation
do
nt
be
horrid
said
constance
if
i
were
alice
you
d
punch
my
head
nora
laughed
all
very
well
but
alice
does
nt
much
care
why
herbert
pryce
marries
her
so
long
as
he
does
marry
her
constance
did
not
reply
she
continued
to
feign
a
headache
but
all
the
time
she
was
thinking
of
the
scene
in
the
wood
that
morning
when
she
and
falloden
had
to
amuse
themselves
plotted
the
rise
in
life
and
the
matrimonial
happiness
of
herbert
and
alice
or
so
you
will
see
that
the
window
shades
are
drawn
and
the
door
closed
and
that
no
one
disturbs
the
man
while
he
is
copying
those
returns
which
he
will
be
sure
to
do
colonel
irons
i
depend
upon
you
to
see
to
it
that
he
has
an
opportunity
to
escape
safely
with
his
budget
i
warn
you
not
to
let
him
fail
it
is
most
important
the
next
morning
weatherly
was
ordered
to
report
to
major
binkus
for
training
in
scout
duty
and
the
morning
after
that
he
was
taken
out
through
the
lines
mounted
with
colonel
irons
and
carefully
lost
in
the
pine
bush
he
was
seen
no
more
in
the
american
camp
the
spy
delivered
his
report
to
the
british
and
the
little
remnant
of
an
army
at
morristown
was
safe
for
the
winter
cornwallis
and
howe
put
such
confidence
in
this
report
that
when
luce
another
spy
came
into
their
camp
with
a
count
of
washington
s
forces
which
was
substantially
correct
they
doubted
the
good
faith
of
the
man
and
threw
him
into
prison
so
the
great
virginian
had
turned
a
british
spy
into
one
of
his
most
effective
helpers
meanwhile
good
news
had
encouraged
enlistment
for
long
terms
four
regiments
of
horse
were
put
in
training
ten
frigates
were
built
and
sent
to
sea
and
more
were
under
construction
the
whole
fighting
force
of
america
was
being
reorganized
moreover
in
this
first
year
the
yankee
privateers
had
so
wounded
a
leg
of
the
british
lion
that
he
was
roaring
with
rage
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
his
ships
well
laden
from
the
west
indies
had
been
seized
their
cargoes
were
valued
at
a
million
pounds
the
fighting
spirit
of
america
was
encouraged
also
by
events
in
france
where
franklin
and
silas
deane
were
now
at
work
france
had
become
an
ally
a
loan
of
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
had
been
secured
in
the
french
capital
and
expert
officers
from
that
country
had
begun
to
arrive
to
join
the
army
of
washington

but

let
me
go
hungry
in
april
the
two
friends
set
out
afoot
for
the
lower
end
of
the
highlands
on
the
river
they
hired
a
dutch
farmer
to
take
them
on
to
albany
in
his
sloop
after
two
delightful
days
at
home
general
schuyler
suggested
that
they
could
do
a
great
service
by
traversing
the
wilderness
to
the
valley
of
the
great
river
of
the
north
as
far
as
possible
toward
swegachie
and
reporting
their
observations
to
crown
point
or
fort
edward
if
there
seemed
to
be
occasion
for
it
and
if
not
they
were
to
proceed
to
general
herkimer
s
camp
at
oriskany
and
give
him
what
help
they
could
in
protecting
the
settlers
in
the
west
you
would
need
to
take
all
your
wit
and
courage
with
you
the
general
warned
them
the
indians
are
in
bad
temper
they
have
taken
to
roasting
their
prisoners
at
the
stake
and
eating
their
flesh
this
is
a
hazardous
undertaking
therefore
i
give
you
a
suggestion
and
not
an
order
i
ll
go
lone
said
solomon
if
i
get
et
up
it
need
nt
break
nobody
s
heart
let
jack
go
to
one
o
the
forts
no
i
d
rather
go
into
the
bush
with
you
said
jack
we
re
both
needed
there
if
necessary
we
could
separate
and
carry
our
warning
in
two
directions
we
ll
take
a
couple
of
the
new
double
barreled
rifles
and
four
pistols
if
we
had
to
i
think
we
could
fight
a
hole
through
any
trouble
we
are
manufacture
a
decent
thick
surface
of
conventionality
and
its
self
conscious
respectable
wing
could
no
more
escape
its
spirit
than
its
fogs
and
winds
but
evil
excitement
was
tempered
to
irresponsible
gaiety
a
constant
whirl
of
innocent
pleasures
when
the
spirit
passed
the
portals
untempered
and
drove
women
too
highly
strung
too
unhappy
or
too
easily
bored
to
the
divorce
courts
to
drink
or
to
reckless
adventure
they
were
summarily
dropped
no
woman
however
guiltless
could
divorce
her
husband
and
remain
a
member
of
that
vigilant
court
it
was
all
or
nothing
if
a
married
woman
were
clever
enough
to
take
a
lover
undetected
and
merely
furnish
interesting
surmise
there
was
no
attempt
to
ferret
out
and
punish
her
for
no
society
can
exist
without
gossip
but
none
centered
about
madeleine
talbot
her
little
coquetries
were
impartial
and
her
devotion
to
her
husband
was
patent
to
the
most
infatuated
eye
life
was
made
very
pleasant
for
her
howard
during
that
first
winter
accompanied
her
to
all
the
dinners
and
parties
and
she
gave
several
entertainments
in
her
large
suite
at
the
occidental
hotel
sally
ballinger
was
a
lively
companion
for
the
mornings
and
was
as
devoted
a
friend
as
youth
could
demand
mrs
abbott
petted
her
and
mrs
ballinger
forgot
that
she
had
been
born
in
boston
when
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
a
sweet
lyric
soprano
charmingly
cultivated
her
popularity
winged
another
flight
san
francisco
from
its
earliest
days
was
musical
and
she
made
a
brilliant
success
as
la
belle
helene
in
the
amateur
light
opera
company
organized
by
mrs
mclane
it
was
rarely
that
she
spent
an
evening
alone
and
the
cases
of
books
she
had
brought
from
boston
remained
in
the
cellars
of
the
hotel
v
society
went
to
the
country
to
escape
the
screaming
winds
and
dust
clouds
of
summer
a
few
had
built
country
houses
the
rest
found
abundant
amusement
at
the
hotels
of
the
geysers
warm
springs
and
congress
springs
taking
the
waters
dutifully
as
the
city
was
constantly
swept
by
epidemics
dr
talbot
rarely
left
his
post
for
even
a
few
days
shooting
and
madeleine
remained
with
him
as
a
matter
of
course
moreover
she
hoped
for
occasional
long
evenings
with
her
husband
and
the
opportunity
to
convince
him
that
her
companionship
was
more
satisfying
than
that
of
his
friends
at
the
club
she
had
not
renounced
the
design
of
gradually
converting
him
to
her
own
love
of
literature
and
pictured
delightful
hours
during
which
they
would
discuss
the
world
s
masterpieces
together
but
he
merely
hooted
amiably
and
pinched
her
cheeks
when
she
approached
the
subject
tentatively
he
was
infernally
over
worked
and
unless
he
had
a
few
hours
relaxation
at
the
club
he
would
be
unfit
for
duty
on
the
morrow
she
was
his
heart
s
delight
the
prettiest
wife
in
san
francisco
he
worked
the
better
because
she
was
always
lovely
at
the
breakfast
table
and
he
could
look
forward
to
a
brief
dinner
in
her
always
radiant
company
thank
god
she
never
had
the
blues
nor
carried
a
bottle
of
smelling
salts
about
with
her
and
she
had
nt
a
nerve
in
her
body
god
how
he
did
hate
women
s
nerves
no
she
was
a
model
wife
and
he
adored
her
unceasingly
but
companionship
when
she
timidly
uttered
the
word
he
first
stared
uncomprehendingly
then
burst
into
loud
laughter
men
do
nt
find
companionship
in
women
my
dear
if
they
pretend
to
they
re
after
something
else
take
the
word
of
an
old
stager
for
that
of
course
there
is
no
such
thing
as
companionship
among
women
as
men
understand
the
term
but
you
have
society
which
is
really
all
you
want
yearnings
are
merely
a
symptom
of
those
accursed
nerves
for
god
s
sake
forget
them
flirt
all
you
choose
there
are
plenty
of
men
in
town
have
them
in
for
dinner
if
you
like
but
if
any
of
those
young
bucks
talks
companionship
to
you
put
up
your
guard
or
come
and
tell
me
i
ll
settle
his
hash
i
do
nt
want
the
companionship
of
any
other
man
but
i
d
like
yours
you
do
nt
know
how
lucky
you
are
you
have
all
of
me
you
could
stand
three
or
four
long
evenings
well
we
d
yawn
in
each
other
s
faces
and
go
to
bed
a
bull
but
true
enough
then
i
think
i
ll
have
the
books
unpacked
not
only
those
i
brought
but
the
new
case
papa
sent
to
me
i
have
lost
the
resource
of
society
for
several
months
and
i
do
not
care
to
have
men
here
after
you
have
gone
that
would
mean
gossip
you
are
above
gossip
and
i
prefer
the
men
to
the
books
you
ll
ruin
your
pretty
eyes
and
you
had
the
makings
of
a
fine
bluestocking
when
i
rescued
you
a
successful
woman
with
her
husband
and
with
society
has
only
sparkling
shallows
in
her
pretty
little
head
now
i
must
run
i
really
should
nt
have
come
all
the
way
up
here
for
lunch
madeleine
wandered
aimlessly
to
the
window
and
looked
down
at
the
scurrying
throngs
on
montgomery
street
there
were
few
women
the
men
bent
against
the
wind
clutching
at
their
hats
or
chasing
them
along
the
uneven
wooden
sidewalks
tripping
perhaps
on
a
loose
board
there
were
tiny
whirlwinds
of
dust
in
the
unpaved
streets
the
bustling
little
city
that
madeleine
had
thought
so
picturesque
in
its
novelty
suddenly
lost
its
glamour
it
looked
as
if
parts
of
it
had
been
flung
together
in
a
night
between
solid
blocks
imported
from
the
older
communities
so
furious
was
the
desire
to
achieve
immediate
wealth
there
were
only
three
or
four
buildings
of
architectural
beauty
in
the
city
the
shop
windows
on
montgomery
street
were
attractive
with
the
wares
of
paris
but
madeleine
coveted
nothing
in
san
francisco
she
thought
of
boston
new
york
washington
europe
and
for
a
moment
nostalgia
overwhelmed
her
if
howard
would
only
take
her
home
now
but
if
he
s
on
earth
he
ll
face
me
sometime
unable
to
control
himself
further
banion
wheeled
and
galloped
away
to
his
own
train
you
ask
if
we
re
to
join
in
with
the
yankees
he
flared
out
to
jackson
no
we
ll
camp
apart
and
train
apart
i
wo
nt
go
on
with
them
well
said
the
scout
i
did
nt
never
think
we
would

believe
ye
could
not

agin

till
a
certain
light
wagon
an

huh
you

say
no
more
of

jackson
but
one
thing
you
and
i
have
got
to
ride
and
see
if
we
can
get
any
trace
of

looking
for

a

the
plains
on
to
the
platte
the
buffalo
new
cheer
seemed
to
come
to
the
hearts
of
the
emigrants
now
and
they
forgot
bickering
the
main
train
ground
grimly
ahead
getting
back
if
not
all
its
egotism
at
least
more
and
more
of
its
self
reliance
by
courtesy
wingate
still
rode
ahead
though
orders
came
now
from
a
joint
council
of
his
leaders
since
banion
would
not
take
charge
the
great
road
to
oregon
was
even
now
not
a
trail
but
a
road
deep
cut
into
the
soil
though
no
wheeled
traffic
had
marked
it
until
within
the
past
five
years
a
score
of
paralled
paths
it
might
be
at
times
of
tentative
location
along
a
hillside
or
a
marshy
level
but
it
was
for
the
most
part
a
deep
cut
unmistakable
road
from
which
it
had
been
impossible
to
wander
at
times
it
lay
worn
into
the
sod
a
half
foot
a
foot
in
depth
sometimes
it
followed
the
ancient
buffalo
trails
to
water
the
first
roads
of
the
far
west
quickly
seized
on
by
hunters
and
engineers
or
again
it
transected
these
hanging
to
the
ridges
after
frontier
road
fashion
heading
out
for
the
proved
fords
of
the
greater
streams
always
the
wheel
marks
of
those
who
had
gone
ahead
in
previous
years
the
continuing
thread
of
the
trail
itself
worn
in
by
trader
and
trapper
and
mormon
and
oregon
or
california
man
gave
hope
and
cheer
to
these
who
followed
with
the
plow
stretching
out
closing
up
almost
inch
by
inch
like
some
giant
measuring
worm
in
its
slow
progress
the
train
held
on
through
a
vast
and
stately
landscape
which
some
travelers
had
called
the
eden
of
america
such
effect
was
given
by
the
series
of
altering
scenes
small
imagination
indeed
was
needed
to
picture
here
a
long
established
civilization
although
there
was
not
a
habitation
they
were
beyond
organized
society
and
beyond
the
law
game
became
more
abundant
wild
turkeys
still
appeared
in
the
timbered
creek
bottoms
many
elk
were
seen
more
deer
and
very
many
antelope
packed
in
northward
by
the
fires
a
number
of
panthers
and
giant
gray
wolves
beyond
counting
kept
the
hunters
always
excited
the
wild
abundance
of
an
unexhausted
nature
offered
at
every
hand
the
sufficiency
of
life
brought
daily
growth
in
the
self
reliance
which
had
left
them
for
a
time
the
wide
timberlands
the
broken
low
hills
of
the
green
prairie
at
length
began
to
give
place
to
a
steadily
rising
inclined
plane
the
soil
became
less
black
and
heavy
with
more
sandy
ridges
the
oak
and
hickory
stout
trees
of
their
forefathers
passed
and
the
cottonwoods
appeared
after
they
had
crossed
the
ford
of
the
big
blue
a
hundred
yards
of
racing
water
they
passed
what
is
now
the
line
between
kansas
and
nebraska
and
followed
up
the
little
blue
beyond
whose
ford
the
trail
left
these
quieter
river
valleys
and
headed
out
over
a
high
table
land
in
a
keen
straight
flight
over
the
great
valley
of
the
platte
the
highway
to
the
rockies
now
the
soil
was
sandier
the
grass
changed
yet
again
they
had
rolled
under
wheel
by
now
more
than
one
hundred
different
varieties
of
wild
grasses
the
vegetation
began
to
show
the
growing
altitude
the
cactus
was
seen
now
and
then
on
the
far
horizon
the
wavering
mysteries
of
the
mirage
appeared
marvelous
in
deceptiveness
mystical
alluring
the
very
spirits
of
the
far
west
appearing
to
move
before
their
eyes
in
giant
pantomime
they
were
passing
from
the
prairies
to
the
plains
shouts
and
cheers
arose
as
the
word
passed
back
that
the
sand
hills
known
as
the
coasts
of
the
platte
were
in
sight
some
mothers
told
their
children
they
were
now
almost
to
oregon
the
whips
cracked
more
loudly
the
tired
teams
tongues
lolling
quickened
their
pace
as
they
struck
the
down
grade
gap
leading
through
the
sand
ridges
two
thousand
americans
some
of
them
illiterate
and
ignorant
all
of
them
strong
taking
with
them
law
order
society
the
church
the
school
anew
were
staging
the
great
drama
of
human
life
act
and
scene
and
episode
as
though
upon
some
great
moving
platform
drawn
by
invisible
cables
beyond
the
vast
proscenium
of
the
hills
chapter
xvii
the
great
encampment
as
the
long
columns
of
the
great
wagon
train
broke
through
the
screening
sand
hills
there
was
disclosed
a
vast
and
splendid
panorama
the
valley
of
the
platte
lay
miles
wide
green
in
the
full
covering
of
spring
a
crooked
and
broken
thread
of
timber
growth
appeared
marking
the
moister
soil
and
outlining
the
general
course
of
the
shallow
stream
whose
giant
cottonwoods
were
dwarfed
now
by
the
distances
in
between
and
for
miles
up
and
down
the
flat
expanse
there
rose
the
blue
smokes
of
countless
camp
fires
each
showing
the
location
of
some
white
topped
ship
of
the
plains
black
specks
grouped
here
and
there
proved
the
presence
of
the
livestock
under
herd
over
all
shone
a
pleasant
sun
now
and
again
the
dark
shadow
of
a
moving
cloud
passed
over
the
flat
valley
softening
its
high
lights
for
the
time
at
times
as
the
sun
chosen
that
way
of
breaking
it
beneath
her
speechless
anguish
there
burned
the
half
conscious
sense
of
having
been
unfairly
treated
when
they
had
entered
into
their
queer
compact
nick
had
known
as
well
as
she
on
what
compromises
and
concessions
the
life
they
were
to
live
together
must
be
based
that
he
should
have
forgotten
it
seemed
so
unbelievable
that
she
wondered
with
a
new
leap
of
fear
if
he
were
using
the
wretched
ellie
s
indiscretion
as
a
means
of
escape
from
a
tie
already
wearied
of
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
with
a
laugh
after
all
you
were
right
when
you
wanted
me
to
be
your
mistress
he
turned
on
her
with
an
astonished
stare
you
my
mistress
through
all
her
pain
she
thrilled
with
pride
at
the
discovery
that
such
a
possibility
had
long
since
become
unthinkable
to
him
but
she
insisted
that
day
at
the
fulmers
have
you
forgotten
when
you
said
it
would
be
sheer
madness
for
us
to
marry
lansing
stood
leaning
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
mosaic
volutes
of
the
floor
i
was
right
enough
when
i
said
it
would
be
sheer
madness
for
us
to
marry
he
rejoined
at
length
she
sprang
up
trembling
well
that
s
easily
settled
our
compact
oh
that
compact
he
interrupted
her
with
an
impatient
laugh
are
nt
you
asking
me
to
carry
it
out
now
because
i
said
we
d
better
part
he
paused
but
the
compact
i
d
almost
forgotten
it
was
to
the
effect
was
nt
it
that
we
were
to
give
each
other
a
helping
hand
if
either
of
us
had
a
better
chance
the
thing
was
absurd
of
course
a
mere
joke
from
my
point
of
view
at
least
i
shall
never
want
any
better
chance
any
other
chance
oh
nick
oh
nick
but
then
she
was
close
to
him
his
face
looming
down
through
her
tears
but
he
put
her
back
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
would
nt
it
he
rejoined
if
we
d
been
as
detachable
as
all
that
as
it
is
it
s
going
to
hurt
horribly
but
talking
it
over
wo
nt
help
you
were
right
just
now
when
you
asked
how
else
we
were
going
to
live
we
re
born
parasites
both
i
suppose
or
we
d
have
found
out
some
way
long
ago
but
i
find
there
are
things
i
might
put
up
with
for
myself
at
a
pinch
and
should
probably
in
time
that
i
ca
nt
let
you
put
up
with
for
me
ever
those
cigars
at
como
do
you
suppose
i
did
nt
know
it
was
for
me
and
this
too
well
it
wo
nt
do
it
wo
nt
do
he
stopped
as
if
his
courage
failed
him
and
she
moaned
out
but
your
writing
if
your
book
s
a
success
my
poor
susy
that
s
all
part
of
the
humbug
we
both
know
that
my
sort
of
writing
will
never
pay
and
what
s
the
alternative
except
more
of
the
same
kind
of
baseness
and
getting
more
and
more
blunted
to
it
at
least
till
now
i
ve
minded
certain
things
i
do
nt
want
to
go
on
till
i
find
myself
taking
them
for
granted
she
reached
out
a
timid
hand
but
you
need
nt
ever
dear
if
you
d
only
leave
it
to
me
he
drew
back
sharply
that
seems
simple
to
you
i
suppose
well
men
are
different
he
walked
toward
the
dressing
table
and
glanced
at
the
little
enamelled
clock
which
had
been
one
of
her
wedding
presents
time
to
dress
is
nt
it
shall
you
mind
if
i
leave
you
to
dine
with
streffy
and
whoever
else
is
coming
i
d
rather
like
a
long
tramp
and
no
more
talking
just
at
present
except
with
myself
he
passed
her
by
and
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
room
susy
stood
motionless
unable
to
lift
a
detaining
hand
or
to
find
a
final
word
of
appeal
on
her
disordered
dressing
table
mrs
vanderlyn
s
gifts
glittered
in
the
rosy
lamp
light
yes
men
were
different
as
he
said
xi
but
there
were
necessary
accommodations
there
always
had
been
nick
in
old
times
had
been
the
first
to
own
it
how
they
had
laughed
at
the
perpendicular
people
the
people
who
went
by
on
the
other
side
since
you
could
nt
be
a
good
samaritan
without
stooping
over
and
poking
into
heaps
of
you
did
nt
know
what
and
now
nick
had
suddenly
become
perpendicular
susy
that
evening
at
the
head
of
the
dinner
table
saw
in
the
breaks
between
her
scudding
thoughts
the
nauseatingly
familiar
faces
of
the
people
she
called
her
friends
strefford
fred
gillow
a
giggling
fool
of
a
young
breckenridge
of
their
new
york
group
who
had
arrived
that
day
and
prince
nerone
altineri
ursula
s
prince
who
in
ursula
s
absence
at
a
tiresome
cure
had
quite
simply
and
naturally
preferred
to
join
her
husband
at
venice
susy
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
as
if
with
newly
opened
eyes
and
wondered
what
life
would
be
like
with
no
faces
but
such
as
theirs
to
furnish
it
ah
nick
had
become
perpendicular
after
all
most
people
went
through
life
making
a
given
set
of
gestures
like
dance
steps
learned
in
advance
if
your
dancing
manual
told
you
at
a
given
time
to
be
perpendicular
you
had
to
be
automatically
and
that
was
nick
but
what
on
earth
susy
gillow
s
puzzled
voice
suddenly
came
to
her
as
from
immeasurable
distances
are
you
going
to
do
in
this
beastly
stifling
hole
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
ask
nick
my
dear
fellow
strefford
answered
for
her
and
by
the
way
where
is
nick
if
one
may
ask
young
breckenridge
interposed
glancing
up
to
take
belated
note
of
his
host
s
absence
dining
out
said
susy
glibly
people
turned
up
blighting
bores
that
i
would
nt
have
dared
to
inflict
on
you
how
easily
the
old
familiar
methods
he
never
was
personal
or
mean
an
addition
to
the
slice
of
a
house
that
really
was
generous
entrancement
filled
her
that
really
is
kind
of
you
she
murmured
gratefully
it
seems
too
much
to
ask
you
did
not
ask
it
was
his
answer
but
i
shall
benefit
by
it
nothing
could
be
nicer
these
rooms
are
so
much
too
small
glancing
about
her
in
flushed
rapture
and
my
bedroom
is
dreadful
i
m
obliged
to
use
rob
s
for
a
dressing
room
the
new
rooms
will
be
for
robin
he
said
an
excellent
method
he
had
discovered
of
entirely
detaching
himself
from
the
excitements
and
emotions
of
other
persons
removed
the
usual
difficulties
in
the
way
of
disappointing
speaking
truths
to
or
embarrassing
people
who
deserved
it
it
was
this
method
which
had
utterly
cast
down
the
defences
of
andrews
feather
was
so
wholly
left
out
of
the
situation
that
she
was
actually
almost
saved
from
its
awkwardness
when
one
is
six
he
explained
one
will
soon
be
seven
nine
twelve
then
the
teens
begin
to
loom
up
and
one
cannot
be
concealed
in
cupboards
on
a
top
floor
even
before
that
time
a
governess
is
necessary
and
even
from
the
abyss
of
my
ignorance
i
see
that
no
respectable
woman
would
stand
either
the
night
or
the
day
nursery
your
daughter
oh
do
nt
call
her
that
cried
feather
my
daughter
it
sounds
as
if
she
were
eighteen
she
felt
as
if
she
had
a
sudden
hideous
little
shock
six
years
had
passed
since
bob
died
a
daughter
a
school
girl
with
long
hair
and
long
legs
to
keep
out
of
the
way
a
grown
up
girl
to
drag
about
with
one
never
would
she
do
it
three
sixes
are
eighteen
coombe
continued
as
was
impressed
upon
one
in
early
years
by
the
multiplication
table
i
never
saw
you
so
interested
in
anything
before
feather
faltered
climbing
steep
narrow
horrid
stairs
to
her
nursery
dismissing
her
nurse
she
paused
a
second
because
a
very
ugly
little
idea
had
clutched
at
her
it
arose
from
and
was
complicated
with
many
fantastic
half
formed
secret
resentments
of
the
past
it
made
her
laugh
a
shade
hysterical
are
you
going
to
see
that
she
is
properly
brought
up
and
educated
so
that
if
anyone
important
falls
in
love
with
her
she
can
make
a
good
match
hers
was
quite
a
hideous
little
mind
he
was
telling
himself
fearful
in
its
latter
day
casting
aside
of
all
such
small
matters
as
taste
and
feeling
people
stripped
the
garments
from
things
in
these
days
he
laughed
inwardly
at
himself
and
his
unwitting
these
days
senile
severity
mouthed
just
such
phrases
were
they
not
his
own
days
and
the
outcome
of
a
past
which
had
considered
itself
so
much
more
decorous
had
not
boldly
questionable
attitudes
been
held
in
those
other
days
how
long
was
it
since
the
prince
regent
himself
had
flourished
it
was
only
that
these
days
brought
it
all
close
against
one
s
eyes
but
this
exquisite
creature
had
a
hideous
little
mind
of
her
own
whatsoever
her
day
later
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
was
unprepared
to
see
her
spring
to
her
feet
and
stand
before
him
absurdly
fantastically
near
being
impassioned
you
think
i
as
too
silly
to
see
anything
she
broke
forth
but
i
do
see
a
long
way
sometimes
i
ca
nt
bear
it
but
i
do
i
do
i
shall
have
a
grown
up
daughter
she
will
be
the
kind
of
girl
everyone
will
look
at
and
someone
important
may
want
to
marry
her
but
oh
he
was
reminded
of
the
day
when
she
had
fallen
at
his
feet
and
clasped
his
rigid
and
reluctant
knees
this
was
something
of
the
same
feeble
desperation
of
mood
oh
why
could
nt
someone
like
that
have
wanted
to
marry
me
see
she
was
like
a
pathetic
fairy
as
she
spread
her
nymphlike
arms
how
pretty
i
am
his
gaze
held
her
a
moment
in
the
singular
fashion
with
which
she
had
become
actually
familiar
because
at
long
intervals
she
kept
seeing
it
again
he
quite
gently
took
her
fingers
and
returned
her
to
her
sofa
please
sit
down
again
he
requested
it
will
be
better
she
sat
down
without
another
imbecile
word
to
say
as
for
him
he
changed
the
subject
with
your
permission
benby
will
undertake
the
business
of
the
lease
and
the
building
he
explained
the
plans
will
be
brought
to
you
we
will
go
over
them
together
if
you
wish
there
will
be
decent
rooms
for
robin
and
her
governess
the
two
nurseries
can
be
made
fit
for
human
beings
to
live
in
and
used
for
other
purposes
the
house
will
be
greatly
improved
it
was
nearly
three
o
clock
when
feather
went
upstairs
to
her
dozing
maid
because
after
he
had
left
her
she
sat
some
time
in
the
empty
untidy
little
drawing
room
and
gazed
straight
before
her
at
a
painted
screen
on
which
shepherdesses
and
swains
were
dancing
in
a
watteau
glade
infested
by
flocks
of
little
loves
chapter
xiv
when
from
robin
s
embarrassed
young
consciousness
there
had
welled
up
the
hesitating
confession
she
does
nt
like
me
she
could
not
of
course
have
found
words
in
which
to
make
the
reasons
for
her
knowledge
clear
but
they
had
for
herself
no
obscurity
the
fair
being
who
at
rare
intervals
fluttered
on
the
threshold
of
her
world
had
a
way
of
looking
at
her
with
a
shade
of
aloof
distaste
in
her
always
transient
gaze
the
unadorned
fact
was
that
feather
did
not
like
her
she
had
been
outraged
by
her
advent
a
baby
was
absurdly
out
of
the
picture
so
far
as
her
mind
encompassed
a
future
she
saw
herself
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
of
smart
pleasures
and
successes
somehow
with
more
money
and
more
exalted
invitations
something
vaguely
having
happened
to
the
entire
lawdor
progeny
and
she
therefore
occupying
a
position
in
which
it
was
herself
this
wine
is
too
good
for
toast
drinking
my
dear
you
do
nt
want
to
mix
emotions
up
with
a
wine

taste

count

up

his
vest
and
opened
his
shirt
he
pulled
up
the
undershirt
onto
his
chest
and
stood
his
chest
black
and
big
stomach
muscles
bulging
under
the
light
you
see
them
below
the
line
where
his
ribs
stopped
were
two
raised
white
welts
see
on
the
back
where
they
come
out
above
the
small
of
the
back
were
the
same
two
scars
raised
as
thick
as
a
finger
i
say
those
are
something
clean
through
the
count

the
music

and
we
started
toward

count

then
the
music
started
again
and
we
danced
i
looked
at
the
count

the
music
stopped
again

week

i
never

i
ll
bet
he
writes
in
coming
to
you
and
to
do
as
you
suggest
would
be
simply
to
make
that
mistake
worse
spade
nodded
indifferently
and
waved
his
hand
at
the
articles
on
the
desk
saying
there
s
your
stuff
and
then
when
cairo
was
returning
them
to
his
pockets
it
s
understood
that
you
re
to
pay
my
expenses
while
i
m
getting
this
black
bird
for
you
and
five
thousand
dollars
when
it
s
done
yes
mr
spade
that
is
five
thousand
dollars
less
whatever
moneys
have
been
advanced
to
you
five
thousand
in
all
right
and
it
s
a
legitimate
proposition
spade
s
face
was
solemn
except
for
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
you
re
not
hiring
me
to
do
any
murders
or
burglaries
for
you
but
simply
to
get
it
back
if
possible
in
an
honest
and
lawful
way
if
possible
cairo
agreed
his
face
also
was
solemn
except
for
the
eyes
and
in
any
event
with
discretion
he
rose
and
picked
up
his
hat
i
am
at
the
hotel
belvedere
when
you
wish
to
communicate
with
me
room
six
thirty
five
i
confidently
expect
the
greatest
mutual
benefit
from
our
association
mr
spade
he
hesitated
may
i
have
my
pistol
sure
i
d
forgotten
it
spade
took
the
pistol
out
of
his
coat
pocket
and
handed
it
to
cairo
cairo
pointed
the
pistol
at
spade
s
chest
you
will
please
keep
your
hands
on
the
top
of
the
desk
cairo
said
earnestly
i
intend
to
search
your
offices
spade
said
i
ll
be
damned
then
he
laughed
in
his
throat
and
said
all
right
go
ahead
i
wo
nt
stop
you
vi
the
undersized
shadow
for
half
an
hour
after
joel
cairo
had
gone
spade
sat
alone
still
and
frowning
at
his
desk
then
he
said
aloud
in
the
tone
of
one
dismissing
a
problem
well
they
re
paying
for
it
and
took
a
bottle
of
manhattan
cocktail
and
a
paper
drinking
cup
from
a
desk
drawer
he
filled
the
cup
two
thirds
full
drank
returned
the
bottle
to
the
drawer
tossed
the
cup
into
the
wastebasket
put
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
turned
off
the
lights
and
went
down
to
the
night
lit
street
an
undersized
youth
of
twenty
or
twenty
one
in
neat
grey
cap
and
overcoat
was
standing
idly
on
the
corner
below
spade
s
building
spade
walked
up
sutter
street
to
kearny
where
he
entered
a
cigar
store
to
buy
two
sacks
of
bull
durham
when
he
came
out
the
youth
was
one
of
four
people
waiting
for
a
street
car
on
the
opposite
corner
spade
ate
dinner
at
herbert
s
grill
in
powell
street
when
he
left
the
grill
at
a
quarter
to
eight
the
youth
was
looking
into
a
nearby
haberdasher
s
window
spade
went
to
the
hotel
belvedere
asking
at
the
desk
for
mr
cairo
he
was
told
that
cairo
was
not
in
the
youth
sat
in
a
chair
in
a
far
corner
of
the
lobby
spade
went
to
the
geary
theatre
failed
to
see
cairo
in
the
lobby
and
posted
himself
on
the
curb
in
front
facing
the
theatre
the
youth
loitered
with
other
loiterers
before
marquard
s
restaurant
below
at
ten
minutes
past
eight
joel
cairo
appeared
walking
up
geary
street
with
his
little
mincing
bobbing
steps
apparently
he
did
not
see
spade
until
the
private
detective
touched
his
shoulder
he
seemed
moderately
surprised
for
a
moment
and
then
said
oh
yes
of
course
you
saw
the
ticket
uh
huh
i
ve
got
something
i
want
to
show
you
spade
drew
cairo
back
towards
the
curb
a
little
away
from
the
other
waiting
theatre
goers
the
kid
in
the
cap
down
by
marquard
s
cairo
murmured
i
ll
see
and
looked
at
his
watch
he
looked
up
geary
street
he
looked
at
a
theatre
sign
in
front
of
him
on
which
george
arliss
was
shown
costumed
as
shylock
and
then
his
dark
eyes
crawled
sidewise
in
their
sockets
until
they
were
looking
at
the
kid
in
the
cap
at
his
cool
pale
face
with
curling
lashes
hiding
lowered
eyes
who
is
he
spade
asked
cairo
smiled
up
at
spade
i
do
not
know
him
he
s
been
tailing
me
around
town
cairo
wet
his
lower
lip
with
his
tongue
and
asked
do
you
think
it
was
wise
then
to
let
him
see
us
together
how
do
i
know
spade
replied
anyway
it
s
done
cairo
removed
his
hat
and
smoothed
his
hair
with
a
gloved
hand
he
replaced
his
hat
carefully
on
his
head
and
said
with
every
appearance
of
candor
i
give
you
my
word
i
do
not
know
him
mr
spade
i
give
you
my
word
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
i
have
asked
nobody
s
assistance
except
yours
on
my
word
of
honor
then
he
s
one
of
the
others
that
may
be
i
just
wanted
to
know
because
if
he
gets
to
be
a
nuisance
i
may
have
to
hurt
him
do
as
you
think
best
he
is
not
a
friend
of
mine
that
s
good
there
goes
the
curtain
good
night
spade
said
and
crossed
the
street
to
board
a
westbound
street
car
the
youth
in
the
cap
boarded
the
same
car
spade
left
the
car
at
hyde
street
and
went
up
to
his
apartment
his
rooms
were
not
greatly
upset
but
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
searched
when
spade
had
washed
and
had
put
on
a
fresh
shirt
and
collar
he
went
out
again
walked
up
to
sutter
street
and
boarded
a
westbound
car
the
youth
boarded
it
also
within
half
a
dozen
blocks
of
the
coronet
spade
left
the
car
and
went
into
the
vestibule
of
a
tall
brown
apartment
building
he
pressed
three
bell
buttons
together
the
street
door
lock
buzzed
he
entered
passed
the
elevator
and
stairs
went
down
a
long
yellow
walled
corridor
to
the
rear
of
the
building
found
a
back
door
fastened
by
a
yale
lock
and
let
himself
out
into
a
narrow
her
mother
had
taken
refuge
at
the
ursuline
convent
along
with
the
other
women
and
children
from
the
lower
town
what
shall
i
take
with
me
father
i
am
so
distracted
i
cannot
think
the
little
valise
that
was
your
mother
s
will
hold
your
things
you
will
need
a
night
gown
and
a
pair
of
stockings
and
a
clean
cotton
blouse
and
some
handkerchiefs
i
should
think
that
would
be
all
and
i
will
give
you
a
package
of
raisins
as
a
present
for
madame
harnois
she
ran
upstairs
and
began
to
pack
her
mother
s
bag
finding
it
hard
to
assemble
her
few
things
in
her
excitement
are
you
ready
cecile
her
father
presently
called
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
am
not
sure
father
i
think
so
i
wish
i
had
known
yesterday
then
you
would
not
have
slept
all
night
come
along
and
i
will
put
the
raisins
in
your
valise
pierre
was
waiting
seated
on
the
long
table
that
served
as
a
counter
her
father
looked
into
her
bag
to
see
that
she
had
the
proper
things
then
handed
it
to
him
cecile
put
on
her
cap
and
coat
auclair
kissed
her
and
wished
them
bon
voyage
take
good
care
of
her
pierre
pierre
touched
his
hand
to
his
black
forelock
as
you
would
yourself
monsieur
he
pushed
cecile
out
of
the
door
before
him
papa
she
called
back
you
will
not
forget
to
keep
the
fire
under
the
soup
it
has
been
on
only
an
hour
pierre
s
boat
was
a
light
shallop
with
one
sail
he
rowed
out
far
enough
to
catch
the
breeze
and
then
sat
in
the
stern
letting
the
wind
and
current
carry
them
he
had
made
a
change
in
his
clothes
during
the
hour
he
was
absent
from
the
shop
cecile
noticed
later
in
the
day
she
wondered
why
had
put
on
a
white
linen
shirt
and
knotted
a
new
red
silk
neckerchief
about
his
throat
he
soon
took
off
his
knitted
cap
lit
his
pipe
and
lounged
at
his
ease
on
one
shore
stretched
the
dark
forest
on
the
other
the
smiling
sunny
fields
that
ran
toward
beaupre
behind
them
the
lower
town
grew
smaller
and
smaller
the
rock
of
kebec
lost
its
detail
until
they
could
see
only
cap
diamant
and
the
chateau
and
the
spires
of
the
churches
the
sunlight
on
the
river
made
a
silver
glare
all
about
the
boat
and
from
the
water
itself
came
a
deep
rhythmic
sound
like
something
breathing
think
of
it
pierre
in
all
these
years
i
have
never
been
on
the
river
before
such
a
stretch
of
lost
opportunity
as
life
seemed
just
then
pierre
smiled
not
so
many
years
at
that
your
father
is
over
cautious
maybe
but
squalls
come
up
suddenly
on
this
river
and
most
of
these
young
fellows
had
as
lief
drown
as
not
i
d
rather
you
never
went
with
anyone
but
me
if
you
like
it
you
can
go
with
me
any
time
but
i
d
like
to
go
the
other
way
to
montreal
and
up
those
rivers
that
are
full
of
rapids
i
want
to
go
as
far
as
michilimackinac
some
time
perhaps
we
ll
see
how
you
like
roughing
it
cecile
asked
what
he
had
in
the
stone
jug
she
saw
in
the
bow
along
with
his
blanket
and
buckskin
coat
that
is
brandy
for
the
smith
but
it
will
come
back
full
of
good
country
wine
he
makes
it
from
wild
grapes
the
wild
grapes
on
the
island
are
the
best
in
canada
jacques
cartier
named
it
the
ile
de
bacchus
because
he
found
such
fine
grapes
growing
in
the
woods
that
ought
to
please
you
with
all
your
latin
are
you
like
mother
juschereau
do
you
think
it
wrong
for
a
girl
to
know
latin
not
if
she
can
cook
a
hare
or
a
partridge
as
well
as
mademoiselle
auclair
she
may
read
all
the
latin
she
pleases
but
i
expect
you
wo
nt
like
the
food
at
the
harnois
a
la
campagnarde
you
know
they
cook
everything
in
grease
as
for
me
it
does
nt
matter
when
you
can
go
to
an
indian
feast
and
eat
dogs
boiled
with
blueberries
you
can
eat
anything
cecile
shuddered
i
do
nt
see
how
you
can
do
it
pierre
i
should
think
it
would
be
easier
to
starve
oh
do
you
my
dear
try
starving
once
it
s
a
long
business
i
ve
known
the
time
when
dog
meat
cooked
in
a
dirty
pot
seemed
delicious
but
the
worst
food
i
ever
swallowed
was
what
they
call
tripe
de
roche
i
went
out
to
lac
la
mort
with
some
frenchmen
early
in
the
spring
once
they
were
a
green
lot
and
they
let
most
of
our
provisions
get
stolen
on
the
way
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
lake
we
were
caught
in
a
second
winter
a
heavy
snow
and
everything
frozen
no
game
no
fish
we
had
to
fall
back
on
tripe
de
roche
it
s
a
kind
of
moss
that
grows
on
the
rocks
along
the
lake
something
like
a
sponge
the
cold
does
nt
kill
it
when
everything
else
is
frozen
hard
as
iron
you
gather
it
and
boil
it
and
it
s
not
so
bad
as
it
goes
down
tastes
like
any
boiled
weed
but
afterwards
oh
what
a
stomach
ache
the
men
sat
round
tied
up
in
a
knot
we
had
about
a
week
of
that
stuff
we
scraped
the
hair
off
our
bear
skins
and
roasted
them
that
time
but
it
s
a
truth
monkey
i
would
nt
like
a
country
where
things
were
too
soft
i
like
a
cold
winter
and
a
hot
summer
my
father
used
to
boast
that
in
languedoc
you
were
never
out
of
sight
of
a
field
or
a
vineyard
that
would
mean
people
everywhere
around
you
always
watching
you
no
hunting
they
put
you
in
jail
if
you
shoot
a
partridge
even
the
fish
in
the
streams
belong
show
up
in
course
of
time
probably
he
had
come
on
a
bitch
in
heat
which
was
about
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
him
gone
so
long
from
night
before
to
going
on
to
noon
maybe
evans
thought
he
should
have
hunted
more
but
the
morning
already
was
halfway
gone
thanks
to
the
wedding
and
the
company
had
to
roll
out
miles
and
he
hated
to
own
up
to
it
but
he
had
felt
a
little
foolish
and
exposed
whistling
around
the
fort
and
by
the
outside
of
indian
lodges
while
tadlock
looked
on
smiling
wise
as
if
to
say
i
told
you
way
back
at
the
start
that
dogs
would
hold
you
up
it
was
nt
tadlock
that
forced
him
on
though
it
was
time
and
time
a
passing
and
last
night
s
talk
of
snow
and
he
already
sore
inside
at
what
his
boy
had
done
the
dog
would
turn
up
that
s
what
he
had
told
brownie
who
was
nt
so
carried
off
by
marriage
as
to
forget
about
old
rock
and
that
was
what
he
looked
to
happen
rock
would
just
turn
up
his
mouth
open
in
what
went
for
a
grin
his
eyes
remembering
from
the
night
meantime
the
train
must
move
you
could
nt
ask
the
folks
to
keep
on
waiting
just
for
a
misplaced
dog
no
matter
if
the
dog
was
rock
evans
slid
over
in
the
saddle
and
cocked
the
other
shoulder
to
the
wind
except
for
the
weather
coming
at
him
a
man
would
nt
think
that
hard
miles
lay
ahead
the
road
looked
pretty
open
as
if
swift
crossings
and
rough
mountains
were
just
dreamed
up
in
greenwood
s
head
three
hundred
miles
to
boise
or
something
close
to
that
more
by
way
of
walla
walla
which
way
they
would
nt
go
since
summers
said
it
was
nt
needful
eight
hundred
miles
to
the
home
they
had
nt
seen
eight
hundred
to
the
new
life
giddap
horse
take
away
the
gray
sky
take
away
the
wind
and
things
looked
gentle
cattle
grazing
horses
grazing
a
bunch
of
indians
bound
for
hall
their
horses
dragging
poles
on
which
their
goods
were
loaded
green
grass
growing
tall
grass
growing
trees
fringed
along
the
snake
but
the
gray
sky
was
here
and
the
wind
and
they
put
a
man
in
mind
of
winter
winter
would
be
along
soon
the
smell
of
it
was
in
the
air
like
the
smell
of
a
thing
out
of
sight
beyond
the
bend
it
made
a
man
feel
half
like
saying
enough
half
like
staying
the
season
out
in
the
grassy
fort
hall
bottoms
and
maybe
staying
longer
cattle
could
be
grown
here
and
horses
and
probably
crops
though
not
a
spade
of
earth
had
been
turned
and
the
indians
would
get
over
being
meddlesome
and
pecky
just
what
pushed
people
on
evans
asked
and
did
nt
bother
thinking
why
for
reasons
seemed
no
good
today
it
was
enough
to
answer
that
oregon
had
put
a
spell
on
them
it
had
put
a
spell
on
all
of
them
except
for
tadlock
and
davisworth
and
brewer
and
mcbee
except
for
one
mcbee
and
he
would
try
to
act
like
real
kinfolks
to
that
one
mcbee
like
rebecca
told
him
to
rebecca
had
taken
the
news
quiet
as
if
she
d
seen
it
coming
and
had
nt
argued
that
he
knew
of
or
scolded
or
asked
brownie
to
wait
she
had
talked
with
him
a
long
time
while
evans
kept
himself
away
not
trusting
himself
to
speak
more
about
it
he
had
gone
to
bed
finally
and
had
heard
their
voices
a
piece
off
from
the
tent
just
as
a
murmur
rebecca
did
nt
speak
when
she
first
came
back
but
undressed
quietly
and
came
to
bed
and
by
and
by
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
knowing
somehow
that
he
did
nt
sleep
maybe
it
ai
nt
the
way
i
might
hope
lije
she
whispered
so
that
brownie
would
nt
hear
it
ai
nt
the
way
i
d
hoped
but
still
it
might
turn
out
to
be
you
hold
yourself
in
lije
i
told
him
if
he
was
sot
all
right
i
recollect
when
you
was
young
think
on
it
lije
i
got
me
a
real
woman
might
be
he
has
she
s
a
good
young
un
do
nt
judge
too
quick
seems
like
you
think
it
s
just
fine
her
hand
patted
him
we
got
to
take
what
comes
and
make
the
best
of
it
and
not
the
worst
you
be
nice
to
her
what
chafed
him
was
he
knew
that
she
was
right
he
said
i
d
just
as
leave
not
talk
tonight
i
m
tired
and
cranky
too
i
reckon
but
in
the
morning
it
was
just
this
morning
come
to
think
of
it
what
worried
her
was
what
the
girl
would
wear
women
were
queer
sometimes
even
becky
it
turned
out
the
girl
was
dressed
all
right
had
shoes
on
and
a
dress
with
a
frilly
collar
and
she
had
twisted
her
hair
up
in
a
way
that
made
her
face
look
frail
and
pretty
prettier
than
ever
there
was
no
denying
the
girl
was
pretty
weatherby
had
done
the
trick
quick
knowing
the
train
must
move
but
still
the
knot
was
likely
tight
enough
too
tight
it
might
turn
out
weatherby
had
been
pleased
at
a
marrying
maybe
because
it
was
the
opposite
of
the
funerals
he
had
had
to
preach
promising
life
instead
of
marking
the
end
of
it
how
did
it
go
what
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
the
picture
of
the
wedding
stood
in
evans
mind
as
he
hunched
into
the
wind
that
got
inside
his
clothes
and
felt
around
his
ribs
the
men
and
women
gathered
in
the
fort
hall
yard
so
s
to
be
in
shelter
and
a
few
favorite
indians
with
them
wondering
at
the
white
man
s
medicine
and
brownie
standing
stiff
and
the
girl
indrawn
and
pale
and
weatherby
asking
in
through
it
a
boxcar
roared
past
chopping
the
empty
space
in
two
and
one
of
the
women
laughed
do
you
think
i
believe
in
jesus
he
said
leaning
toward
her
and
speaking
almost
as
if
he
were
breathless
well
i
would
nt
even
if
he
existed
even
if
he
was
on
this
train
who
said
you
had
to
she
asked
in
a
poisonous
eastern
voice
he
drew
back
the
waiter
brought
his
dinner
he
began
eating
slowly
at
first
then
faster
as
the
women
concentrated
on
watching
the
muscles
that
stood
out
on
his
jaw
when
he
chewed
he
was
eating
something
spotted
with
eggs
and
livers
he
finished
that
and
drank
his
coffee
and
then
pulled
his
money
out
the
steward
saw
him
but
he
would
nt
come
total
the
bill
every
time
he
passed
the
table
he
would
wink
at
the
women
and
stare
at
haze
mrs
hitchcock
and
the
lady
had
already
finished
and
gone
finally
the
man
came
and
added
up
the
bill
haze
shoved
the
money
at
him
and
then
pushed
past
him
out
of
the
car
for
a
while
he
stood
between
two
train
cars
where
there
was
fresh
air
of
a
sort
and
made
a
cigarette
then
the
porter
passed
between
the
two
cars
hey
you
parrum
he
called
the
porter
did
nt
stop
haze
followed
him
into
the
car
all
the
berths
were
made
up
the
man
in
the
station
in
melsy
had
sold
him
a
berth
because
he
said
he
would
have
to
sit
up
all
night
in
the
coaches
he
had
sold
him
an
upper
one
haze
went
to
it
and
pulled
his
sack
down
and
went
into
the
men
s
room
and
got
ready
for
the
night
he
was
too
full
and
he
wanted
to
hurry
and
get
in
the
berth
and
lie
down
he
thought
he
would
lie
there
and
look
out
the
window
and
watch
how
the
country
went
by
a
train
at
night
a
sign
said
to
get
the
porter
to
let
you
into
the
uppers
he
stuck
his
sack
up
into
his
berth
and
then
went
to
look
for
the
porter
he
did
nt
find
him
at
one
end
of
the
car
and
he
started
back
to
the
other
going
around
the
corner
he
ran
into
something
heavy
and
pink
it
gasped
and
muttered
clumsy
it
was
mrs
hitchcock
in
a
pink
wrapper
with
her
hair
in
knots
around
her
head
she
looked
at
him
with
her
eyes
squinted
nearly
shut
the
knobs
framed
her
face
like
dark
toadstools
she
tried
to
get
past
him
and
he
tried
to
let
her
but
they
were
both
moving
the
same
way
each
time
her
face
became
purplish
except
for
little
white
marks
over
it
that
did
nt
heat
up
she
drew
herself
stiff
and
stopped
and
said
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
slipped
past
her
and
dashed
down
the
aisle
and
ran
into
the
porter
so
that
the
porter
fell
down
you
got
to
let
me
into
the
berth
parrum
he
said
the
porter
picked
himself
up
and
went
lurching
down
the
aisle
and
after
a
minute
he
came
lurching
back
again
stone
faced
with
the
ladder
haze
stood
watching
him
while
he
put
the
ladder
up
then
he
started
up
it
halfway
up
he
turned
and
said
i
remember
you
your
father
was
a
nigger
named
cash
parrum
you
ca
nt
go
back
there
neither
nor
anybody
else
not
if
they
wanted
to
i
m
from
chicago
the
porter
said
in
an
irritated
voice
my
name
is
not
parrum
cash
is
dead
haze
said
he
got
the
cholera
from
a
pig
the
porter
s
mouth
jerked
down
and
he
said
my
father
was
a
railroad
man
haze
laughed
the
porter
jerked
the
ladder
off
suddenly
with
a
wrench
of
his
arm
that
sent
the
boy
clutching
at
the
blanket
into
the
berth
he
lay
on
his
stomach
for
a
few
minutes
and
did
nt
move
after
a
while
he
turned
and
found
the
light
and
looked
around
him
there
was
no
window
he
was
closed
up
in
the
thing
except
for
a
little
space
over
the
curtain
the
top
of
the
berth
was
low
and
curved
over
he
lay
down
and
noticed
that
the
curved
top
looked
as
if
it
were
not
quite
closed
it
looked
as
if
it
were
closing
he
lay
there
for
a
while
not
moving
there
was
something
in
his
throat
like
a
sponge
with
an
egg
taste
he
did
nt
want
to
turn
over
for
fear
it
would
move
he
wanted
the
light
off
he
reached
up
without
turning
and
felt
for
the
button
and
snapped
it
and
the
darkness
sank
down
on
him
and
then
faded
a
little
with
light
from
the
aisle
that
came
in
through
the
foot
of
space
not
closed
he
wanted
it
all
dark
he
did
nt
want
it
diluted
he
heard
the
porter
s
footsteps
coming
down
the
aisle
soft
into
the
rug
coming
steadily
down
brushing
against
the
green
curtains
and
fading
up
the
other
way
out
of
hearing
then
after
a
while
when
he
was
almost
asleep
he
thought
he
heard
them
again
coming
back
his
curtains
stirred
and
the
footsteps
faded
in
his
half
sleep
he
thought
where
he
was
lying
was
like
a
coffin
the
first
coffin
he
had
seen
with
someone
in
it
was
his
grandfather
s
they
had
left
it
propped
open
with
a
stick
of
kindling
the
night
it
had
sat
in
the
house
with
the
old
man
in
it
and
haze
had
watched
from
a
distance
thinking
he
ai
nt
going
to
let
them
shut
it
on
him
when
the
time
comes
his
elbow
is
going
to
shoot
into
the
crack
his
grandfather
had
been
a
circuit
preacher
a
waspish
old
man
who
had
ridden
over
three
counties
with
jesus
hidden
in
his
head
like
a
stinger
when
it
was
time
to
bury
him
they
shut
the
top
of
his
box
down
and
he
did
control
i
got
dumped
and
hurt
my
shoulder
and
this
put
me
on
light
duty
with
too
much
time
to
think
at
a
time
when
i
had
many
reasons
it
seemed
to
me
to
feel
sorry
for
myself
because
of
light
duty
i
was
orderly
that
day
in
the
battalion
commander
s
office
i
was
eager
at
first
for
i
had
never
been
there
before
and
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression
i
discovered
that
captain
frankel
did
nt
want
zeal
he
wanted
me
to
sit
still
say
nothing
and
not
bother
him
this
left
me
time
to
sympathize
with
myself
for
i
did
nt
dare
go
to
sleep
then
suddenly
shortly
after
lunch
i
was
nt
a
bit
sleepy
sergeant
zim
came
in
followed
by
three
men
zim
was
smart
and
neat
as
usual
but
the
expression
on
his
face
made
him
look
like
death
on
a
pale
horse
and
he
had
a
mark
on
his
right
eye
that
looked
as
if
it
might
be
shaping
up
into
a
shiner
which
was
impossible
of
course
of
the
other
three
the
one
in
the
middle
was
ted
hendrick
he
was
dirty
well
the
company
had
been
on
a
field
exercise
they
do
nt
scrub
those
prairies
and
you
spend
a
lot
of
your
time
snuggling
up
to
the
dirt
but
his
lip
was
split
and
there
was
blood
on
his
chin
and
on
his
shirt
and
his
cap
was
missing
he
looked
wild
eyed
the
men
on
each
side
of
him
were
boots
they
each
had
rifles
hendrick
did
not
one
of
them
was
from
my
squad
a
kid
named
leivy
he
seemed
excited
and
pleased
and
slipped
me
a
wink
when
nobody
was
looking
captain
frankel
looked
surprised
what
is
this
sergeant
zim
stood
frozen
straight
and
spoke
as
if
he
were
reciting
something
by
rote
sir
h
company
commander
reports
to
the
battalion
commander
discipline
article
nine
one
oh
seven
disregard
of
tactical
command
and
doctrine
the
team
being
in
simulated
combat
article
nine
one
two
oh
disobedience
of
orders
same
conditions
captain
frankel
looked
puzzled
you
are
bringing
this
to
me
sergeant
officially
i
do
nt
see
how
a
man
can
manage
to
look
as
embarrassed
as
zim
looked
and
still
have
no
expression
of
any
sort
in
his
face
or
voice
sir
if
the
captain
pleases
the
man
refused
administrative
discipline
he
insisted
on
seeing
the
battalion
commander
i
see
a
bedroll
lawyer
well
i
still
do
nt
understand
it
sergeant
but
technically
that
s
his
privilege
what
was
the
tactical
command
and
doctrine
a
freeze
sir
i
glanced
at
hendrick
thinking
oh
oh
he
s
going
to
catch
it
in
a
freeze
you
hit
dirt
taking
any
cover
you
can
fast
and
then
freeze
do
nt
move
at
all
not
even
twitch
an
eyebrow
until
released
or
you
can
freeze
when
you
re
already
in
cover
they
tell
stories
about
men
who
had
been
hit
while
in
freeze
and
had
died
slowly
but
without
ever
making
a
sound
or
a
move
frankel
s
brows
shot
up
second
part
same
thing
sir
after
breaking
freeze
failing
to
return
to
it
on
being
so
ordered
captain
frankel
looked
grim
name
zim
answered
hendrick
t
c
sir

r
p

six
oh

very
well
hendrick
you
are
deprived
of
all
privileges
for
thirty
days
and
restricted
to
your
tent
when
not
on

or
at

subject
only
to
sanitary
necessities
you
will
serve
three
hours
extra

one
hour
to

served
just
before

time
of

as
much
bread
as
you
can
eat
you
will
serve
ten
hours
extra
duty
each
sunday
the
time
to
be
adjusted
to
permit
you
to
attend
divine
services
if
you
so
elect
i
thought
oh
my
he
threw
the
book
captain
frankel
went
on
hendrick
the
only
reason
you
are
getting
off
so
lightly
is
that
i
am
not
permitted
to
give
you
any
more
than
that
without
convening
a
court
martial
and
i
do
nt
want
to
spoil
your
company
s
record
dismissed
he
dropped
his
eyes
back
to
the
papers
on
his
desk
the
incident
already
forgotten
and
hendrick
yelled
you
did
nt
hear
my
side
of
it
the
captain
looked
up
oh
sorry
you
have
a
side
you
darn
right
i
do
sergeant
zim
s
got
it
in
for
me
he
s
been
riding
me
riding
me
riding
me
all
day
long
from
the
time
i
got
here
he
that
s
his
job
the
captain
said
coldly
do
you
deny
the
two
charges
against
you
no
but
he
did
nt
tell
you
i
was
lying
on
an
anthill
frankel
looked
disgusted
oh
so
you
would
get
yourself
killed
and
perhaps
your
teammates
as
well
because
of
a
few
little
ants
not
just
a
few
there
were
hundreds
of
em
stingers
so
young
man
let
me
put
you
straight
had
it
been
a
nest
of
rattlesnakes
you
would
still
have
been
expected
and
required
to
freeze
frankel
paused
have
you
anything
at
all
to
say
in
your
own
defense
hendrick
s
mouth
was
open
i
certainly
do
he
hit
me
he
laid
hands
on
me
the
whole
bunch
of
em
are
always
strutting
around
with
those
silly
batons
whackin
you
across
the
fanny
punchin
you
between
the
shoulders
and
tellin
you
to
brace
up
and
i
put
up
with
it
but
he
hit
me
with
his
hands
he
knocked
me
down
to
the
ground
and
yelled
freeze
you
stupid
jackass
how
about
that
captain
frankel
looked
down
at
his
hands
looked
up
again
at
hendrick
young
man
you
are
under
a
misapprehension
very
common
among
civilians
you
think
that
your
superior
officers
are
not
permitted
to
lay
hands
on
you
as
you
put
it
under
purely
social
conditions
that
this
would
make
the
drunk
go
away
but
it
brought
him
closer
to
us
his
face
under
the
blue
streetlight
seemed
splashed
with
purple
do
nt
lie
for
him
he
said
with
exquisite
gentleness
he
s
not
worth
it
how
much
is
he
giving
you
i
do
nt
care
how
much
it
is
it
s
never
enough
when
he
gets
a
new
pretty
boy
he
ll
throw
you
out
on
the
street
like
an
old
trojan
daddy
let
s
go
i
said
frightened
now
and
chilled
clear
through
the
night
went
in
one
side
of
me
and
came
out
the
other
and
encountered
no
obstacle
my
father
began
to
push
around
him
and
the
drunk
lifted
his
hand
and
my
father
in
answer
lifted
his
own
hand
this
made
the
drunk
take
a
back
step
and
he
nearly
fell
knock
me
down
the
drunk
said
smiling
so
broadly
his
cheeks
gleamed
knock
me
down
when
i
want
to
save
your
soul
are
you
ready
to
die
this
made
my
father
jerk
still
like
a
halted
movie
the
drunk
seeing
his
triumph
repeated
are
you
ready
to
die
the
drunk
nimbly
sidestepped
to
me
and
put
his
arm
around
my
waist
and
gave
me
a
hug
his
breath
was
like
the
odor
the
seniors
taking
chemistry
sometimes
left
in
room
before
we
came
in
for
thursday
study
hall
a
complex
stench
both
sulphurous
and
sweet
ah
he
told
me
you
re
a
good
warm
body
but
you
re
all
skin
and
bone
does
nt
the
old
bastard
feed
you
hey
you
he
called
to
my
father
what
sort
of
an
old
lech
do
you
call
yourself
lifting
these
poor
boys
off
the
street
with
empty
stomachs
i
thought
i
was
ready
to
die
my
father
said
but
now
i
wonder
if
anybody
ever
is
i
wonder
now
if
a
ninety
nine
year
old
chinaman
with
tuberculosis
gonorrhea
syphilis
and
toothache
is
ready
to
die
the
drunk
s
fingers
began
to
gouge
under
my
ribs
and
i
jerked
out
of
his
grasp
daddy
let
s
go
no
peter
my
father
said
this
gentleman
is
talking
sense
are
you
ready
to
die
he
asked
the
drunk
what
do
you
think
the
answer
is
squinting
shoulders
back
chest
preening
the
drunk
with
pigeon
dignity
stepped
into
my
father
s
tall
shadow
and
looking
up
told
him
carefully
i
ll
be
ready
to
die
when
you
and
everybody
like
you
is
locked
up
in
jail
and
they
throw
away
the
key
you
ca
nt
even
let
these
poor
kids
rest
on
a
night
like
this
he
looked
over
at
me
under
frowning
eyebrows
and
said
shall
we
call
the
cops
kid
let
s
kill
this
old
nance
huh
to
my
father
he
said
what
about
it
chief
how
much
is
it
worth
to
you
not
to
have
me
call
the
cops
and
have
you
picked
up
with
this
flower
he
inflated
his
chest
as
if
to
shout
but
the
street
dwindled
northward
toward
infinity
without
upholding
another
visible
soul
just
the
painted
brick
fronts
with
the
little
railed
porches
characteristic
of
alton
the
stone
stoops
now
and
then
bearing
an
ornamented
cement
flower
pot
the
leafless
curbside
trees
alternating
and
in
the
end
mixing
with
the
telephone
poles
parked
cars
lined
this
street
but
few
passed
down
it
because
it
met
a
dead
end
at
the
essick
s
factory
wall
two
blocks
away
we
stood
beside
the
long
low
cement
block
back
of
a
brewery
warehouse
its
corrugated
green
doors
had
slammed
tight
shut
and
the
memory
of
the
clang
seemed
to
make
the
air
here
hard
the
drunk
began
to
pluck
at
my
father
s
chest
rubbing
his
thumb
and
fingers
after
each
pluck
as
if
disposing
of
a
louse
or
a
piece
of
lint
ten
dollars
he
said
ten
dollars
and
my
mouth
is
he
pressed
three
blue
fingers
against
his
swollen
violet
lips
and
held
them
there
as
if
testing
how
long
he
could
hold
his
breath
at
last
he
lifted
them
away
exhaled
a
huge
feather
of
frozen
vapor
smiled
and
said
so
ten
dollars
buys
me
lock
stock
and
barrel
he
winked
at
me
and
asked
is
that
a
bargain
kid
or
not
what
s
he
paying
you
he
s
my
father
i
insisted
frantic
my
father
was
kneading
his
spotted
hands
together
under
the
lamplight
and
the
uprightness
of
his
posture
seemed
a
stiffness
as
if
he
had
been
poleaxed
and
in
the
next
instant
would
fall
five
dollars
the
drunk
quickly
said
to
him
five
lousy
dollars
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
dropped
to
one
one
little
bitty
dollar
bill
so
i
can
get
myself
a
drink
and
stop
freezing
to
death
come
on
chief
give
me
a
break
i
ll
even
tell
you
a
hotel
where
they
do
nt
ask
any
questions
i
know
all
about
hotels
my
father
said
in
the
depression
i
took
a
job
as
night
clerk
at
the
old
osiris
before
they
closed
it
down
the
bedbugs
got
to
be
as
big
as
the
prostitutes
so
the
customers
could
nt
tell
em
apart
i
guess
the
osiris
was
before
your
time
the
drunk
lost
his
grin
i
come
from
easton
originally
he
said
it
occurred
to
me
with
a
shock
that
he
was
much
younger
than
my
father
indeed
he
was
virtually
a
boy
like
me
my
father
dug
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
some
change
and
gave
it
to
the
young
man
i
d
like
to
give
you
more
my
friend
but
i
just
do
nt
have
it
this
is
my
last
thirty
five
cents
i
m
a
public
school
teacher
and
our
pay
scale
is
way
behind
that
of
industry
i
ve
enjoyed
talking
to
you
though
and
i
d
like
to
shake
your
hand
and
he
did
you
ve
clarified
my
thinking
he
told
the
drunk
my
father
turned
and
walked
back
the
way
we
had
come
and
i
hurried
to
follow
the
things
we
had
been
he
ll
kill
you
not
so
the
voice
dissented
again
calmly
no
he
ca
nt
kill
you
he
s
already
done
his
damnedest
you
ve
survived
his
worst
don
t
listen
run
for
your
life
he
ll
beat
you
unconscious
then
strangle
you
where
you
lie
for
god
s
sake
don
t
get
up
listen
to
me
he
wo
nt
kill
you
if
he
wanted
you
dead
he
could
have
gutted
you
with
that
peavey
pole
leaning
against
the
garage
there
or
he
could
have
cut
your
throat
with
that
whittling
knife
he
carries
or
just
could
have
stomped
your
head
in
with
those
boots
when
you
were
looking
for
your
tooth
over
there
in
the
gravel
pile
he
s
not
trying
to
kill
you
oh
the
first
voice
stopped
its
shrilling
and
demanded
with
a
sly
arrogance
then
what
are
we
flailing
around
to
get
up
out
of
this
berry
vine
for
to
stagger
back
out
in
the
gravel
and
lose
another
tooth
if
he
isn
t
bent
on
homicide
what
logical
reason
have
we
for
trying
to
rise
to
defend
ourselves
i
ceased
my
thorny
struggle
for
a
second
perplexed
by
this
new
tack
yes
now
that
you
mention
it
why
i
pondered
the
question
as
the
world
of
my
left
eye
rapidly
shrank
to
a
blue
lined
slit
why
indeed
then
hank
mistaking
my
hesitation
for
surrender
stepped
over
to
extend
a
hand
of
aid
i
took
it
and
he
dragged
me
from
the
vines
because
if
he
knows
already
that
i
can
could
have
killed
him
might
have
killed
him
would
have
would
have
just
as
sure
as
sin
if
he
had
kept
on
just
standing
there
letting
me
beat
him
up
in
front
of
viv
just
like
he
would
have
drowned
under
that
car
at
the
beach
on
halloween
if
it
had
been
left
up
to
him
but
this
time
he
did
nt
just
stand
to
my
everlasting
surprise
the
kid
had
fought
back
even
after
she
d
seen
all
she
needed
well
hank
asked
you
had
it
i
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
i
think
so
good
goddam
deal
because
i
m
shot
clean
to
hell
let
s
wash
up
this
time
he
had
fought
with
nobody
to
pull
him
out
from
under
what
he
knew
was
maybe
death
when
he
crawled
in
under
it
nobody
to
pull
him
out
but
himself
we
walked
back
to
the
landing
and
squatted
there
tossing
water
into
our
faces
i
rose
to
get
the
album
with
viv
s
photo
from
the
boat
then
returned
andy
silently
offered
a
handkerchief
and
we
silently
accepted
taking
turns
there
was
no
more
shouting
either
from
across
the
river
or
inside
the
head
no
more
stomping
no
more
voices
it
was
quiet
and
when
i
saw
this
i
gave
up
my
notion
of
homicide
i
had
already
cooled
down
a
good
deal
for
one
thing
because
i
got
to
realizing
that
whether
lee
knew
it
or
not
him
prodding
me
into
a
hassle
was
for
much
more
than
just
viv
s
benefit
and
for
another
thing
it
just
ai
nt
so
light
a
chore
doing
a
man
in
i
do
nt
care
how
hot
you
are
under
the
collar
if
that
man
himself
decides
to
do
something
against
it
we
finished
up
washing
and
walked
up
to
stand
in
the
garage
the
kid
was
looking
pretty
stunned
by
all
the
action
he
d
been
in
so
was
old
andy
and
me
too
i
imagine
none
of
us
thought
leland
had
that
much
gumption
to
him
well
you
can
take
the
jeep
on
in
if
you
want
i
told
him
i
ll
stay
an
talk
a
little
with
andy
i
believe
about
this
mill
fire
business
but
how
ll
you
get
it
back
from
town
lee
asked
me
and
said
i
can
hitchhike
i
ve
done
it
before
if
you
want
to
keep
it
here
naw
i
patted
the
jeep
on
the
hood
it
was
still
hot
go
on
and
use
her
i
told
him
i
ll
send
somebody
in
in
a
little
bit
with
andy
to
bring
her
back
lee
did
nt
say
anything
to
that
he
was
looking
pretty
solemn
up
at
that
window
but
some
way
i
felt
like
kidding
a
bit
the
only
thing
i
ask
is
you
take
care
of
her
she
s
mighty
finicky
sometimes
what
he
said
it
tickled
me
to
fruster
him
that
way
it
always
had
what
are
you
the
jeep
i
m
asking
will
you
take
care
of
her
he
looked
at
the
dock
best
that
i
can
she
may
need
gas
i
took
out
my
wallet
i
can
give
you
some
cash
no
i
ll
be
all
right
with
my
wages
and
policy
you
re
sure
you
ll
say
so
if
you
need
some
more
money
you
ll
get
word
back
i
promise
andy
man
what
do
you
say
me
and
you
ride
over
t
the
house
and
get
me
some
of
lee
s
blood
outa
my
hair
and
talk
about
grinning
black
cats
and
the
like
hey
over
a
bottle
of
johnny
walker
what
say
okeedoke
then
bub
so
long
and
maybe
we
ll
see
you
around
sometime
and
we
left
him
there
starting
the
jeep
and
walked
back
down
to
the
boat
i
was
feeling
all
right
maybe
not
in
god
s
pocket
because
it
ai
nt
so
easy
a
thing
losing
a
wife
but
more
all
right
about
myself
than
i
had
in
a
good
spell
in
the
attic
viv
reaches
out
to
pull
the
window
closed
in
just
the
short
time
it
has
been
open
the
rain
has
swollen
the
edges
enough
to
make
shutting
it
difficult
by
the
time
she
has
it
wedged
shut
again
the
jeep
has
pulled
away
down
the
road
and
hank
and
andy
are
returning
in
the
boat
hank
seems
cheerful
when
she
greets
him
downstairs
she
does
nt
mention
the
fight
she
ca
nt
tell
if
he
knows
she
was
watching
promptly
and
dropped
letters
as
he
answered
them
straight
into
the
wastebasket
laurel
had
seen
him
do
it
and
when
it
concerned
her
mother
if
that
was
what
she
asked
for
he
went
but
there
was
nothing
of
her
mother
here
for
fay
to
find
or
for
herself
to
retrieve
the
only
traces
there
were
of
anybody
were
the
drops
of
nail
varnish
laurel
studiously
went
to
work
on
them
she
lifted
them
from
the
surface
of
the
desk
and
rubbed
it
afterwards
with
wax
until
nothing
was
left
to
show
of
them
either
that
was
on
saturday
laurel
remember
when
we
really
were
the
bridesmaids
tish
cried
as
they
sat
over
drinks
after
dinner
it
was
sunday
evening
while
the
bridesmaids
parents
still
lived
within
a
few
blocks
of
the
mckelva
house
the
bridesmaids
and
their
husbands
had
mostly
all
built
new
houses
in
the
new
part
of
mount
salus
their
own
children
were
farther
away
still
off
in
college
now
tish
s
youngest
son
was
still
at
home
he
wo
nt
come
out
though
tish
had
said
he
has
company
a
girl
came
in
through
his
bedroom
window
to
play
chess
with
him
that
s
what
she
said
i
think
she
s
the
same
one
who
came
in
through
his
window
last
night
close
to
eleven
o
clock
i
saw
car
lights
in
the
driveway
and
went
to
see
they
call
him
every
minute
girls
he
s
fifteen
and
remember
mama
at
the
wedding
tish
said
now
crying
when
it
was
over
saying
to
your
father
oh
clint
is
nt
it
the
saddest
thing
and
judge
mac
saying
why
no
tennyson
if
i
had
thought
there
was
anything
sad
to
be
said
for
it
i
should
have
prevented
it
prevented
it
i
never
saw
a
man
enjoy
a
wedding
more
said
gert
wartime
or
no
wartime
we
had
pink
champagne
that
judge
mac
sent
all
the
way
to
new
orleans
for
one
of
the
others
cried
and
a
five
piece
negro
band
remember
miss
becky
thought
it
was
utter
extravagance
child
foolishness
but
judge
mac
insisted
on
it
all
a
big
wedding
right
on
down
the
line
well
laurel
was
an
only
child
mother
had
a
superstitious
streak
underneath
laurel
said
protectively
she
might
have
had
a
notion
it
was
unlucky
to
make
too
much
of
your
happiness
from
her
place
on
the
chaise
longue
by
the
window
she
saw
lightning
flickering
now
in
the
western
sky
like
the
feathers
of
a
bird
taking
a
bath
judge
mac
laughed
her
out
of
it
then
remember
the
parties
we
had
for
you
gert
gave
laurel
a
lovingly
derisive
slap
that
was
before
the
old
country
club
burned
down
there
never
was
another
dance
floor
like
that
what
kind
of
dancer
was
phil
polly
i
forget
tish
lifted
her
arms
as
though
the
memory
would
come
up
and
dance
her
away
to
remind
her
firm
said
laurel
she
turned
her
cheek
a
little
further
away
on
the
pillow
your
daddy
knew
how
to
enjoy
a
grand
occasion
as
well
as
we
did
as
long
as
it
stayed
elegant
and
as
long
as
papa
did
nt
get
too
high
before
it
was
over
tish
said
of
course
mama
should
have
saved
all
her
tears
for
her
own
child
s
wedding
tish
was
the
only
divorce
as
laurel
was
the
only
widow
tish
had
eloped
with
the
captain
of
their
high
school
football
team
but
miss
becky
would
rather
go
through
anything
than
a
grand
occasion
said
gert
i
remember
once
it
must
ve
been
the
bar
association
meeting
or
maybe
when
he
was
mayor
and
they
had
to
function
at
some
to
do
in
jackson
anyway
once
judge
mac
himself
bought
miss
becky
a
dress
to
wear
came
home
with
it
in
a
box
and
surprised
her
beaded
crepe
shot
beads
neck
to
hem
shot
beads
said
tish
where
could
you
have
been
laurel
gert
said
he
d
picked
it
out
in
new
orleans
some
clerk
sold
it
to
him
music
started
up
from
off
in
another
room
of
the
house
duke
ellington
the
young
do
nt
dance
to
him
they
play
chess
to
him
i
suppose
tish
said
aside
to
laurel
and
miss
becky
said
clinton
if
i
d
just
been
told
in
advance
you
were
going
to
make
me
an
extravagant
present
i
d
have
asked
you
for
a
load
of
floor
sweepings
from
the
cottonseed
oil
mill
ca
nt
you
hear
her
tish
cried
she
wore
it
though
did
nt
she
one
of
them
asked
and
tish
said
oh
they
d
do
anything
for
each
other
sure
she
wore
it
and
the
weight
she
had
to
carry
miss
becky
told
mama
in
confidence
that
when
she
was
nt
wearing
that
dress
which
was
nearly
a
hundred
per
cent
of
the
time
she
had
to
keep
it
in
a
bucket
the
bridesmaids
laughed
till
they
cried
but
when
she
wanted
to
justify
him
she
wore
it
with
an
air
what
floored
me
laurel
was
him
getting
married
again
when
i
saw
fay
said
gert
when
i
saw
what
he
had
there
mama
for
his
sake
asked
at
the
beginning
if
she
would
nt
be
allowed
to
give
some
sort
of
little
welcome
for
her
a
sitdown
tea
i
believe
she
had
in
mind
and
fay
said
oh
please
do
nt
bother
with
a
big
wholesale
reception
that
kind
of
thing
was
for
becky
poor
judge
mac
because
except
when
it
came
to
picking
a
wife
tish
said
smiling
at
laurel
he
was
a
pretty
worldly
old
sweet
since
when
have
you
started
laughing
at
them
laurel
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
are
they
just
figures
from
now
on
to
make
a
good
story
she
turned
on
tish
and
you
can
wink
over
father
polly
tish
grabbed
her
we
were
nt
laughing
at
them
they
were
nt
funny
no
more
than
my
father
and
mother
are
no
more
than
all
our
fathers
and
mothers
are
she
laughed
again
into
laurel
it
as
he
wanted
every
night
but
he
was
good
to
her
even
then
he
did
not
cheat
and
beat
her
both
which
meant
he
was
good
to
her
according
to
her
mother
his
mother
the
other
women
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
fact
just
about
everyone
she
knew
who
seemed
always
to
expect
the
two
occurrences
together
like
the
twin
faces
of
a
single
plague
but
had
she
lost
interest
in
sex
completely
she
did
nt
know
it
was
simply
that
sex
was
now
something
that
she
knew
and
thought
she
understood
before
it
had
been
curiosity
about
her
body
s
power
nor
was
her
response
to
eddie
s
lovemaking
as
uncomplicated
as
he
appeared
to
think
she
had
not
been
wandering
exactly
on
those
afternoons
she
had
found
herself
in
front
of
daxter
s
funeral
home
that
huge
snowy
two
storied
building
that
stood
on
a
hill
between
a
church
and
an
all
night
cafe
daxter
s
was
owned
by
george
daxter
an
obese
half
white
man
in
his
fifties
his
mother
so
the
story
went
was
white
when
her
parents
found
she
was
pregnant
by
the
black
man
who
worked
for
them
they
shut
her
up
in
the
cellar
and
threw
away
the
key
they
fed
her
pig
bran
and
a
little
watery
milk
when
daxter
was
born
he
was
thrown
out
into
the
street
with
the
rest
of
the
trash
he
was
raised
by
an
old
woman
who
later
died
of
tomaine
poisoning
she
had
eaten
some
sour
rotten
tomatoes
daxter
gave
her
daxter
had
been
after
meridian
since
she
was
twelve
years
old
she
would
visit
the
funeral
home
on
saturday
afternoons
as
everybody
did
to
see
who
was
new
in
the
viewing
room
daxter
would
entice
her
into
the
small
back
office
where
he
kept
a
long
sofa
and
two
soft
chairs
at
first
she
thought
daxter
generous
he
gave
her
candy
for
a
swift
exploratory
feel
when
she
became
older
fifteen
or
so
he
would
take
out
his
wallet
crammed
with
money
and
leave
it
on
the
sofa
between
them
while
he
felt
her
breasts
and
tried
to
pull
her
onto
his
lap
the
only
part
she
liked
was
when
he
sucked
her
nipples
and
she
liked
to
hear
his
breathing
like
his
throat
was
closing
when
she
let
one
chubby
hand
touch
the
bottom
of
her
panties
she
could
sit
holding
his
head
against
her
breasts
where
he
busily
and
noisily
sucked
and
feel
the
hot
throbbing
of
his
passion
almost
enter
her
but
his
obesity
in
the
end
was
distasteful
to
her
she
had
heard
that
fat
men
had
short
stunted
penises
she
imagined
daxter
s
penis
to
look
like
an
english
walnut
when
daxter
was
not
around
she
allowed
herself
to
be
chased
around
the
embalming
table
by
his
young
assistant
an
almost
handsome
man
but
dissipated
and
with
a
face
that
as
the
saying
went
begged
for
pussy
he
thought
of
nothing
else
his
tool
of
seduction
his
description
was
his
voice
which
he
used
to
describe
the
act
of
intercourse
holding
her
with
her
back
tight
against
him
so
that
his
penis
was
like
a
hard
live
bedpost
against
her
hips
he
would
whisper
in
her
ear
think
of
how
it
would
feel
he
would
urge
grabbing
one
then
both
of
her
nipples
to
have
this
big
black
long
ummm
and
he
would
press
the
bedpost
against
her
inside
you
slippin
in
and
slippin
out
she
hated
him
but
was
fascinated
she
was
also
far
from
immune
to
the
voice
the
assistant
would
manipulate
her
breasts
and
cram
her
between
his
legs
and
rub
her
so
against
him
that
her
panties
became
flooded
with
the
residue
of
her
resistance
the
assistant
was
very
clever
and
so
never
actually
forced
her
beyond
a
certain
point
but
each
time
he
left
her
with
one
of
his
little
homilies
experience
is
the
best
the
only
teacher
and
just
looking
at
water
will
never
teach
you
to
swim
one
day
the
assistant
who
knew
he
said
how
much
she
wanted
to
was
ready
to
be
fucked
if
not
by
him
then
by
the
voice
the
bedpost
arranged
for
her
to
watch
him
while
he
seduced
another
schoolgirl
the
same
girl
in
fact
who
did
baby
sitting
for
his
wife
he
did
it
in
the
small
shed
where
the
wicker
baskets
were
stored
she
watched
because
she
was
curious
wanted
to
learn
without
doing
if
possible
and
because
she
had
nothing
better
to
do
on
a
hot
wednesday
afternoon
the
assistant
began
by
standing
with
his
bedpost
against
the
back
of
the
girl
she
was
about
sixteen
and
wore
loafers
and
a
red
cardigan
sweater
turned
backward
with
a
neat
little
white
collar
her
small
brown
hands
kept
checking
the
collar
to
be
sure
it
had
not
become
unfastened
by
the
stripping
quality
of
the
assistant
s
words
his
hands
were
elsewhere
already
under
the
cardigan
kneading
the
nipples
then
into
her
pants
as
her
skirt
fell
to
the
floor
then
he
hoisted
her
up
onto
the
table
and
began
to
fuck
her
standing
up
then
up
on
the
table
the
girl
was
bucking
up
and
down
as
fast
as
she
could
as
if
she
feared
to
break
a
rhythm
she
had
learned
by
heart
the
voice
fucked
more
slowly
expertly
like
a
machine
and
the
voice
never
stopped
talking
at
the
end
he
watched
her
as
if
from
a
distance
his
voice
a
monotone
his
face
greedy
obscene
and
ugly
when
the
girl
tried
to
bury
her
face
in
his
chest
and
force
his
arms
around
her
he
pushed
her
away
the
assistant
said
later
that
the
girl
was
his
now
whenever
he
wanted
her
because
he
had
discovered
a
secret
few
men
knew
how
to
make
a
woman
come
by
using
nothing
but
his
penis
and
his
beautiful
voice
these
were
his
gifts
the
assistant
said
more
skillful
than
the
suppleness
of
wrist
required
to
extract
cold
blood
from
a
cadaver
nevertheless
as
an
extra
precaution
even
the
mixing
engineers
were
told
that
they
were
working
on
a
picture
called
the
mendocino
story
in
the
course
of
the
mix
the
music
track
the
voice
track
and
the
sound
effects
track
were
all
fit
together
and
the
resulting
sound
track
combined
with
the
images
made
a
single
piece
of
film
called
the
answer
print
show
me
an
answer
print
said
vito
pointing
with
thanksgiving
and
weary
glory
to
the
six
double
reels
of
film
that
filled
two
metal
carrying
cases
and
i
ll
show
you
a
motion
picture
limply
billy
thought
that
if
nothing
else
marriage
had
added
to
her
vocabulary
the
two
cases
held
the
net
results
of
months
of
virtually
nonstop
work
the
cooperation
of
hundreds
of
people
the
total
commitment
of
one
small
group
the
expenditure
of
more
than
two
million
dollars
and
an
incalculable
number
of
small
miracles
bad
weather
illness
on
the
part
of
the
actors
accidents
in
labs
or
any
one
of
the
hundreds
of
other
things
that
can
go
wrong
during
the
shooting
of
a
picture
had
nt
happened
the
inevitable
series
of
minor
and
major
crises
had
somehow
been
surmounted
by
vito
s
absolute
determination
to
make
this
movie
and
make
it
fast
luck
and
billy
had
been
on
his
side
it
was
mid
november
when
vito
had
his
answer
print
at
last
curt
arvey
was
in
new
york
his
difficulties
with
vito
were
merely
infuriating
compared
to
the
huge
disaster
the
studio
was
facing
with
its
major
production
a
star
studded
musical
based
on
dickens
pickwick
papers
a
fifteen
million
dollar
film
which
the
studio
had
been
counting
on
for
christmas
release
and
the
family
trade
pickwick
which
should
have
been
finished
months
ago
was
still
a
month
behind
schedule
and
bogging
down
day
by
day
it
was
now
almost
three
million
dollars
over
budget
and
arvey
s
board
of
directors
had
summoned
him
to
new
york
to
explain
pickwick
had
been
booked
into
two
hundred
and
fifty
carefully
chosen
topnotch
first
run
houses
and
it
was
obvious
that
no
combination
of
events
would
enable
them
to
meet
those
dates
vito
telephoned
oliver
sloan
the
head
of
sales
at
arvey
film
studio
you
fellows
can
see
the
answer
print
of
mirrors
now
oliver
he
announced
casually
jeezus
that
s
the
head
of
sales
checked
his
unseemly
astonishment
at
the
incredible
speed
with
which
the
picture
had
come
through
postproduction
i
ll
have
to
call
you
back
on
that
vito
anytime
vito
responded
knowing
that
sloan
would
have
to
report
to
arvey
before
he
said
anything
more
with
difficulty
oliver
sloan
reached
his
employer
in
his
hotel
suite
in
manhattan
after
a
brief
conversation
he
hung
up
and
sighed
to
his
assistant
arvey
said
to
burn
the
fucking
print
when
orsini
walks
in
the
door
and
to
throw
his
ass
in
jail
what
are
you
going
to
do
we
ll
see
it
first
i
think
before
we
burn
it
mr
arvey
was
nt
in
one
of
his
better
moods
sloan
then
called
vito
and
set
up
a
screening
for
the
next
day
with
the
gloom
of
a
medical
examiner
about
to
perform
his
ten
thousandth
autopsy
the
next
afternoon
at
two
the
big
screening
room
was
half
filled
with
the
upper
echelon
of
the
studio
s
sales
advertising
and
promotion
departments
some
sixteen
men
in
all
four
of
them
brought
their
secretaries
who
by
virtue
of
seniority
and
tradition
often
deigned
to
come
to
screenings
of
new
pictures
since
there
were
no
big
stars
in
mirrors
they
had
scant
interest
in
the
film
itself
but
each
of
them
wanted
to
be
among
the
first
in
the
studio
secretary
population
to
know
what
billy
ikehorn
s
husband
had
come
up
with
the
sixteen
men
as
was
their
wont
made
no
audible
reactions
to
the
picture
except
for
a
few
coughs
and
the
sound
of
cigarettes
being
lit
as
the
film
ended
the
four
secretaries
scrambled
out
a
side
door
as
inconspicuously
as
possible
and
the
men
sat
a
minute
in
the
traditional
noncommittal
silence
but
this
time
it
was
deeper
and
longer
than
usual
everyone
waited
for
the
reaction
of
oliver
sloan
eventually
he
said
thanks
vito
see
you
around
and
walked
out
he
was
followed
by
the
other
men
discussing
business
matters
in
low
tones
either
ignoring
vito
or
else
greeting
him
with
tiny
meaningless
nods
vito
waited
until
the
last
man
had
left
and
quickly
slipped
out
of
the
screening
room
he
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
executive
men
s
room
there
he
slid
quietly
into
a
stall
and
waited
oliver
sloan
s
voice
was
the
first
he
heard
jeezus

is
the
first
time
i

and

all
sentimental
vito
had
heard
enough
smiling
like
a
conquering
caesar
he
left
the
stall
and
stood
at
the
door
to
the
men
s
room
addressing
the
four
well
polished
shoes
planted
on
the
floor
under
the
stalls

in
the
kitchen
of

thin
lips
that

almost
invisible
and
deep
green
eyes
that
were
dead
he
wore
two
hundred
dollar
shoes
and
white
socks
joseph
big
joe
colella
was
a
huge
slab
of
a
man
a
granite
monolith
and
when
he
walked
he
looked
like
a
building
moving
someone
had
once
called
him
a
vegetable
garden
colella
s
got
a
potato
nose
cauliflower
ears
and
a
pea
brain
colella
had
a
soft
high
pitched
voice
and
a
deceptively
gentle
manner
he
owned
a
race
horse
and
had
an
uncanny
knack
for
picking
winners
he
was
a
family
man
with
a
wife
and
six
children

specialties
were
guns
acid
and
chains
joe

wife

on
sundays
when

not
working
he
always
took
his
family
to
church
the

almost
a
midget
he
stood
five
feet
three
inches
and
weighed
a
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
he
had
the
innocent
face
of
a
choirboy
and
was
equally
adept
with
a
gun
or
a
knife
women
were
greatly
attracted
to
the
little
man
and
he
boasted
a
wife
half
a
dozen
girl
friends
and
a
beautiful
mistress
fiore

once
been
a

horse
the
commissioner

body
was
found
floating
in
lake
tahoe
a
week
later
the
three
men
were

family
but
it
was

they

capo
of
the
most
powerful
mafia
family
on
the
east
coast
seventy
two
years
old
he
was
still
a
powerful
looking
man
with
the
shoulders
and
broad
chest
of
a
laborer
and
a
shock
of
white
hair
born
in
palermo
sicily
antonio
granelli
came
to
america
when
he
was
fifteen
and
went
to
work
on
the
waterfront
on
the
west
side
of
lower
manhattan
by
the
time
he
was
twenty
one
he
was
lieutenant
to
the
dock
boss
the
two
men
had
an
argument
and
when
the
boss
mysteriously
disappeared
antonio
granelli
had
taken
over
anyone
who
wanted
to
work
on
the
docks
had
to
pay
him
he
had
used
the
money
to
begin
his
climb
to
power
and
had
expanded
rapidly
branching
out
into
loan
sharking
and
the
numbers
racket
prostitution
and
gambling
and
drugs
and
murder
over
the
years
he
had
been
indicted
thirty
two
times
and
had
only
been
convicted
once
on
a
minor
assault
charge
granelli
was
a
ruthless
man
with
the
down
to
earth
cunning
of
a
peasant
and
a
total
amorality
to
granelli
s
left
sat
thomas
colfax
the
family
consigliere
twenty
five
years
earlier
colfax
had
had
a
brilliant
future
as
a
corporation
lawyer
but
he
had
defended
a
small
olive
oil
company
which
turned
out
to
be
mafia
controlled
and
step
by
step
had
been
lured
into
handling
other
cases
for
the
mafia
until
finally
through
the
years
the
granelli
family
had
become
his
sole
client
it
was
a
very
lucrative
client
and
thomas
colfax
became
a
wealthy
man
with
extensive
real
estate
holdings
and
bank
accounts
all
over
the
world
to
the
right
of
antonio
granelli
sat
michael
moretti
his
son
in
law
michael
was
ambitious
a
trait
that
made
granelli
nervous
michael
did
not
fit
into
the
pattern
of
the
family
his
father
giovanni
a
distant
cousin
of
antonio
granelli
had
been
born
not
in
sicily
but
in
florence
that
alone
made
the
moretti
family
suspect
everybody
knew
that
florentines
were
not
to
be
trusted
giovanni
moretti
had
come
to
america
and
opened
a
shop
as
a
shoemaker
running
it
honestly
without
even
a
back
room
for
gambling
or
loan
sharking
or
girls
which
made
him
stupid
giovanni
s
son
michael
was
entirely
different
he
had
put
himself
through
yale
and
the
wharton
school
of
business
when
michael
had
finished
school
he
had
gone
to
his
father
with
one
request
he
wanted
to
meet
his
distant
relative
antonio
granelli
the
old
shoemaker
had
gone
to
see
his
cousin
and
the
meeting
had
been
arranged
granelli
was
sure
that
michael
was
going
to
ask
for
a
loan
so
that
he
away
freud
had
an
easy
summer
at
the
arbuthnot
the
bear
simply
had
nt
turned
out
to
be
the
gold
mine
freud
had
hoped
for
what
freud
wanted
was
a
different
bear
with
a
bear
this
dumb
he
told
my
mother
and
father
there
s
no
point
in
trying
to
better
my
take
and
you
got
other
problems
when
you
hustle
them
cheap
resorts
my
mother
took
my
father
s
hand
and
gave
it
firm
warning
pressure
perhaps
because
she
saw
him
imagining
those
other
problems
those
cheap
resorts
but
my
father
was
thinking
of
his
tuition
at
harvard
he
liked
the
indian
and
the
bear
called
state
o
maine
he
had
nt
seen
freud
put
the
slightest
effort
into
training
the
bear
and
win
berry
was
a
boy
who
believed
in
himself
coach
bob
s
son
was
a
young
man
who
imagined
he
could
do
anything
he
could
imagine
he
had
earlier
planned
that
after
the
summer
at
the
arbuthnot
he
would
go
to
cambridge
take
a
room
and
find
a
job
perhaps
in
boston
he
would
get
to
know
the
area
around
harvard
and
get
employed
in
the
vicinity
so
that
as
soon
as
there
was
money
for
tuition
he
could
enroll
this
way
he
imagined
he
might
even
be
able
to
keep
a
part
time
job
and
go
to
harvard
my
mother
of
course
had
liked
this
plan
because
boston
to
dairy
and
back
again
was
an
easy
trip
on
the
boston
maine
the
trains
ran
regularly
then
she
was
already
imagining
the
visits
from
my
father
long
weekends
and
perhaps
the
occasional
though
proper
visits
she
might
make
to
cambridge
or
boston
to
see
him
what
do
you
know
about
bears
anyway
she
asked
or
motorcycles
she
did
nt
like
either
his
idea
that
if
freud
was
unwilling
to
part
with
his
indian
or
his
bear
father
would
travel
the
logging
camps
with
freud
win
berry
was
a
strong
boy
but
not
vulgar
and
mother
imagined
the
camps
to
be
vulgar
places
from
which
father
would
not
emerge
the
same
or
would
not
emerge
at
all
she
need
nt
have
worried
that
summer
and
how
it
would
end
were
obviously
planned
more
hugely
and
inevitably
than
any
trivial
arrangements
my
father
and
mother
could
imagine
ahead
of
them
that
summer
of
was
as
inevitable
as
the
war
in
europe
as
it
would
soon
be
called
and
all
of
them
freud
mary
bates
and
winslow
berry
were
as
lightly
tossed
along
by
the
summer
as
the
gulls
knocked
about
in
the
rough
currents
at
the
mouth
of
the
kennebec
one
night
in
late
august
when
mother
had
served
at
the
evening
meal
and
had
only
just
had
time
to
change
into
her
saddle
shoes
and
the
long
skirt
she
played
croquet
in
father
was
called
from
his
room
to
assist
with
an
injured
man
father
ran
past
the
lawn
for
croquet
where
mother
was
waiting
for
him
she
held
a
mallet
over
her
shoulder
the
christmas
like
light
bulbs
strung
in
the
trees
lit
the
lawn
for
croquet
in
such
a
ghostly
way
that
to
my
father
my
mother
looked
like
an
angel
holding
a
club
i
ll
be
right
with
you
father
said
to
her
someone
s
been
hurt
she
came
with
him
and
some
other
running
men
and
they
ran
down
to
the
hotel
piers
alongside
the
dock
was
a
throbbing
big
ship
aglow
with
lights
a
band
with
too
much
brass
was
playing
on
board
and
the
strong
fuel
smell
and
motor
exhaust
in
the
salt
air
mixed
with
the
smell
of
crushed
fruit
it
appeared
that
some
enormous
bowl
of
alcoholic
fruit
punch
was
being
served
to
the
ship
s
guests
and
they
were
spilling
it
over
themselves
or
washing
the
deck
down
with
it
at
the
end
of
the
dock
a
man
lay
on
his
side
bleeding
from
a
wound
in
his
cheek
he
had
stumbled
coming
up
the
ladder
and
had
torn
his
face
on
a
mooring
cleat
he
was
a
large
man
his
face
florid
in
the
blue
wash
of
the
light
from
the
moon
and
he
sat
up
as
soon
as
anybody
touched
him
scheiss
he
said
my
father
and
mother
recognized
the
german
word
for
shit
from
freud
s
many
performances
with
the
assistance
of
several
strong
young
men
the
german
was
brought
to
his
feet
he
had
bled
magnificently
over
his
white
dinner
jacket
which
seemed
large
enough
to
clothe
two
men
his
blue
black
cummerbund
resembled
a
curtain
and
his
matching
bow
tie
stuck
up
straight
at
his
throat
like
a
twisted
propeller
he
was
rather
jowly
and
he
smelled
strongly
of
the
fruit
punch
served
on
board
ship
he
bellowed
to
someone
from
on
board
came
a
chorus
of
german
and
a
tall
tanned
woman
in
an
evening
dress
with
yellow
lace
or
ruching
came
up
the
dock
s
ladder
like
a
panther
wearing
silk
the
bleeding
man
seized
her
and
leaned
on
her
so
heavily
that
the
woman
despite
her
own
obvious
strength
and
agility
was
pushed
into
my
father
who
helped
her
maintain
her
balance
she
was
much
younger
than
the
man
my
mother
noted
and
also
german
speaking
in
an
easy
clucking
manner
to
him
while
he
continued
to
bleat
and
gesture
nastily
to
those
members
of
the
german
chorus
left
on
board
up
the
dock
and
up
the
gravel
driveway
the
big
couple
wove
at
the
entrance
to
the
arbuthnot
the
woman
turned
to
my
father
and
said
with
a
controlled
accent
he
vill
need
stitches
ja
of
course
you
haf
a
doctor
the
deck
manager
whispered
to
father
get
freud
stitches
freud
said
the
doctor
lives
all
the
way
in
bath
and
he
s
a
drunk
but
i
know
how
to
stitch
anybody
the
desk
manager
ran
out
to
the
dorm
and
shouted
for
freud
get
on
your
indian
and
bring
old
doc
todd
here
we
ll
sober
him
up
when
he
arrives
the
manager
said
but
for
god
s
floor
he
sensed
the
auditorium
walls
shaking
from
the
clapping
and
foot
pounding
that
greeted
the
end
of
the
speech
from
the
rear
he
looked
inside
the
entire
audience
was
on
its
feet
onstage
virgilia
stood
with
her
head
thrown
back
her
exertions
had
loosened
her
hair
and
disarrayed
her
clothing
but
she
was
unconcerned
her
face
shone
with
a
dreamy
exaltation
with
fulfillment
he
turned
away
sickened
once
outside
he
gulped
air
and
relished
the
falling
snow
he
would
have
to
tell
her
she
had
spoken
effectively
of
course
but
he
also
intended
to
take
issue
with
her
unfounded
generalizations
her
performance
deeply
offended
him
not
only
on
intellectual
grounds
but
on
personal
ones
it
was
true
that
virgilia
was
a
grown
woman
in
charge
of
her
own
life
nevertheless
to
see
his
sister
or
any
other
female
display
herself
so
shamelessly
made
him
cringe
no
matter
what
its
veneer
of
propriety
her
speech
had
been
an
outpouring
of
sexual
passion
it
had
permitted
her
to
say
things
no
woman
no
man
for
that
matter
would
have
dared
to
say
in
public
in
another
context
what
dismayed
him
most
was
his
feeling
that
virgilia
had
reveled
in
the
experience
and
not
solely
for
the
moralistic
reasons
she
proclaimed
but
even
if
he
put
aside
the
personal
considerations
the
shouts
and
halloos
within
the
hall
continued
to
upset
him
they
showed
him
a
dimension
of
the
slavery
quarrel
whose
existence
he
had
never
before
suspected
no
matter
how
worthy
virgilia
s
cause
she
had
somehow
twisted
it
an
appeal
for
justice
was
transformed
into
a
sordid
even
frightening
call
for
a
savage
holy
war
there
were
warriors
aplenty
inside
he
could
still
hear
them
howling
for
southern
blood
on
the
train
he
had
decided
that
all
the
sin
lay
on
the
southern
side
the
side
of
the
slave
owners
and
all
the
destructive
pride
as
well
tonight
had
taught
him
a
fearful
lesson
he
was
wrong
in
an
hour
he
had
changed
his
view
of
northern
abolitionists
for
virgilia
had
surely
taken
her
cue
from
other
members
of
the
movement
how
many
of
them
were
more
interested
in
confrontation
than
in
resolution
of
the
problem
how
many
preached
hate
instead
of
common
sense
he
did
nt
condone
slavery
or
excuse
the
mains
because
of
what
he
had
witnessed
tonight
but
for
the
first
time
he
believed
there
might
be
some
cause
for
the
mains
resentment
just
as
they
claimed
could
the
friendship
of
men
from
different
regions
a
camaraderie
born
in
shared
hardships
endure
such
terrible
pressures
was
there
enough
good
will
in
humankind
and
the
nation
to
overcome
the
kind
of
mindless
passions
he
had
seen
unleashed
by
his
sister
he
shivered
as
wind
driven
snow
flew
at
him
beneath
the
marquee
of
the
auditorium
the
storm
was
intensifying
hiding
the
nearby
lights
of
the
town
he
began
to
perceive
a
future
much
grimmer
than
any
he
had
heretofore
imagined
he
had
a
brief
dark
vision
of
the
country
hammered
by
the
slave
question
until
it
shattered
like
brittle
cast
iron
difficult
times
surely
lay
ahead
constance
would
help
sustain
him
during
those
times
and
he
hoped
his
love
would
do
the
same
for
her
but
as
for
the
nation
surviving
the
hammering
finding
the
flexibility
and
compassion
necessary
to
resolve
the
issue
he
just
did
nt
know
about
that
until
this
moment
he
supposed
he
had
lived
with
illusion
or
ignorance
now
huddled
against
the
wall
beneath
the
marquee
and
unable
to
light
his
cigar
in
the
rising
wind
he
was
staring
at
reality
it
terrified
him
a
lehigh
canal
boat
carried
george
on
the
last
stage
of
his
journey
the
canal
followed
the
course
of
the
river
through
the
valley
from
mauch
chunk
down
to
easton
the
grand
valley
of
the
lehigh
had
been
home
to
four
generations
of
hazards
george
s
great
grandfather
had
left
a
job
at
a
forge
in
the
pine
barrens
of
new
jersey
then
the
leading
ironworking
region
of
the
colonies
to
strike
out
on
his
own
in
pennsylvania
the
valley
had
no
huge
natural
deposits
similar
to
the
bog
ore
of
jersey
nor
was
there
as
much
flux
as
the
pine
barrens
men
took
from
nearby
salt
bays
in
the
form
of
clay
and
oyster
shells
but
george
s
great
grandfather
did
find
great
stands
of
timber
for
conversion
to
charcoal
he
found
water
power
most
important
of
all
he
found
opportunity
for
years
his
was
the
only
furnace
on
the
river
ore
had
to
be
brought
over
the
mountains
in
leather
bags
carried
by
pack
horses
but
that
did
nt
deter
him
the
same
transportation
system
had
served
furnaces
in
jersey
for
a
long
time
competitors
said
he
was
crazy
not
to
move
to
the
schuylkill
river
valley
but
george
s
great
grandfather
paid
no
attention
and
persevered
in
the
valley
of
the
lehigh
he
was
his
own
master
succeeding
or
failing
solely
on
the
basis
of
his
own
decisions
during
the
revolution
the
hazards
threw
everything
into
the
war
effort
and
almost
went
to
the
wall
financially
luckily
the
rebels
won
and
the
continuity
of
the
line
was
not
abruptly
ended
by
a
hang
rope
but
unqualified
success
continued
to
prove
elusive
year
after
year
the
hazards
were
forced
to
ship
their
iron
down
the
river
to
the
delaware
in
antiquated
durham
boats
that
were
forever
incurring
damage
on
the
rocks
of
the
lehigh
rapids
then
in
the
canal
opened
a
local
man
josiah
white
had
developed
it
principally
to
ship
anthracite
coal
that
had
been
discovered
in
the
region
but
the
canal
boats
brought
prosperity
to
almost
every
business
in
the
valley
and
hazard
iron
was
no
exception
for
a
century
products
of
the
ironwork
had
provided
the
family
with
a
steady
if
unremarkable
income
suddenly
thanks
to
the
canal
many
more
markets
were
within
reach
and
in
one
generation
that
of
george
s
father
the
hazards
were
rich
george
had
grown
up
with
the
canal
the
shouts
had
five
plus
reverse
and
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
central
avenue
light
he
was
asking
himself
why
he
had
nt
gotten
the
rabbit
with
an
automatic
fuel
efficiency
was
the
answer
is
this
worth
an
extra
two
miles
per
gallon
ryan
laughed
at
himself
as
he
headed
east
toward
the
chesapeake
bay
then
right
onto
falcon
s
nest
road
there
was
rarely
any
traffic
back
here
falcon
s
nest
road
came
to
a
dead
end
not
too
far
down
from
ryan
s
place
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
were
several
farms
also
dormant
at
the
beginning
of
winter
the
stubby
remains
of
cornstalks
lay
in
rows
on
the
brown
hard
fields
he
turned
left
into
his
driveway
ryan
had
thirty
acres
on
peregrine
cliff
his
nearest
neighbor
an
engineer
named
art
palmer
was
half
a
mile
away
through
heavily
wooded
slopes
and
across
a
murky
stream
the
cliffs
on
the
western
shore
of
the
chesapeake
bay
were
nearly
fifty
feet
high
where
jack
lived
those
farther
south
got
a
little
higher
but
not
much
and
made
of
crumbly
sandstone
they
were
a
paleontologist
s
delight
every
so
often
a
team
from
a
local
college
or
museum
would
scour
at
the
base
and
find
fossilized
shark
teeth
that
had
once
belonged
to
a
creature
as
large
as
a
midget
submarine
along
with
the
bones
of
even
more
unlikely
creatures
that
had
lived
here
a
hundred
million
years
earlier
the
bad
news
was
that
the
cliffs
were
prone
to
erosion
his
house
was
built
a
hundred
feet
back
from
the
edge
and
his
daughter
was
under
strict
orders
twice
enforced
with
a
spanking
not
to
go
anywhere
near
the
edge
in
an
attempt
to
protect
the
cliff
face
the
state
environmental
protection
people
had
persuaded
ryan
and
his
neighbors
to
plant
kudzu
a
prolific
weed
from
the
american
south
the
weed
had
thoroughly
stabilized
the
cliff
face
but
it
was
now
attacking
the
trees
near
the
cliff
and
jack
periodically
had
to
go
after
them
with
a
weed
eater
to
save
the
trees
from
being
smothered
but
that
was
nt
a
problem
this
time
of
year
ryan
s
lot
was
half
open
and
half
wooded
the
part
near
the
road
had
once
been
fanned
though
not
easily
as
the
ground
was
not
flat
enough
to
drive
a
tractor
across
it
safely
as
he
approached
his
house
the
trees
began
some
gnarled
old
oaks
and
other
deciduous
trees
whose
leaves
were
gone
now
leaving
skeletal
branches
to
reach
out
into
the
thin
cold
air
as
he
approached
the
carport
he
saw
that
cathy
was
already
home
her
porsche
and
the
family
wagon
parked
in
the
carport
he
had
to
leave
his
rabbit
in
the
open
daddy
sally
yanked
open
the
door
and
ran
out
without
her
jacket
to
meet
her
father
it
s
too
cold
out
here
jack
told
his
daughter
no
is
nt
sally
replied
she
grabbed
his
briefcase
and
carried
it
with
two
hands
puffing
as
she
climbed
up
the
three
steps
into
the
house
ryan
got
out
of
his
coat
and
hung
it
in
the
entry
closet
as
with
everything
else
it
was
hard
to
do
with
one
hand
he
was
cheating
a
little
now
as
with
steering
the
car
he
was
starting
to
use
his
left
hand
careful
to
avoid
putting
any
strain
on
his
shoulder
the
pain
was
completely
gone
now
but
ryan
was
sure
that
he
could
bring
it
back
quickly
enough
if
he
did
something
dumb
besides
which
cathy
would
yell
at
him
he
found
his
wife
in
the
kitchen
she
was
looking
at
the
pantry
and
frowning
hi
honey
hi
jack
you
re
late
so
are
you
ryan
kissed
his
wife
cathy
smelled
his
breath
her
nose
crinkled
how
s
robby
fine
and
i
just
had
two
very
light
ones
uh
huh
she
turned
back
to
the
pantry
what

jack
suggested

a
big
help
i
ought

let

not

turn

i
knew

have
stopped
at
the
giant
cathy
groused
how

bernie
says
hi

jack
laughed
ever
since
they
came
back
their
diet
had
consisted
mainly
of
basic
american
staples
and
it
was
a
little
late
for
something
fancy
okay
i
m
going
to
change
and
punch
up
something
on
the
computer
for
a
few
minutes
careful
with
the
arm
jack
five
times
a
day
she
warns
me
jack
sighed
never
marry
a
doctor
the
ryan
home
was
a
deckhouse
design
the
living
dining
room
had
a
cathedral
ceiling
that
peaked
sixteen
feet
over
the
carpeted
floor
with
an
enormous
wood
beam
a
wall
of
triple
paned
windows
faced
the
bay
with
a
large
deck
beyond
the
sliding
glass
doors
opposite
the
glass
was
a
massive
brick
fireplace
that
reached
through
the
roof
the
master
bedroom
was
half
a
level
above
the
living
room
with
a
window
that
enabled
one
to
look
down
into
it
ryan
trotted
up
the
steps
the
house
design
accommodated
large
closets
ryan
selected
casual
clothes
and
went
through
the
annoying
ritual
of
changing
himself
one
handed
he
was
still
experimenting
trying
to
find
an
efficient
way
to
do
it
finished
he
went
back
down
and
curved
around
the
stairs
to
the
next
level
down
his
library
it
was
a
large
one
jack
read
a
lot
and
also
purchased
books
he
did
nt
have
time
to
read
banking
against
the
time
when
he
would
he
had
a
large
desk
up
against
the
windows
on
the
bay
side
of
the
house
here
was
his
personal
computer
an
apple
and
all
of
its
peripheral
equipment
ryan
flipped
it
on
and
started
typing
in
instructions
next
he
put
his
modem
on
line
and
trying
to
be
slow
with
it
so
that
i
would
tumble
into
the
darkness
as
i
d
so
often
done
with
only
the
soul
speaking
to
me
yes
telling
me
its
secrets
as
the
blood
spurted
into
my
mouth
as
i
let
my
mouth
fill
before
i
swallowed
yes
brother
i
am
sorry
brother
and
then
staggering
forward
i
stepped
on
the
corpse
before
me
and
crushed
it
underfoot
give
me
the
last
one
no
resistance
he
stared
up
at
me
in
utter
quiet
as
if
some
light
had
dawned
in
him
as
if
he
d
found
in
theory
or
belief
some
perfect
rescue
i
pulled
him
to
me
gently
lestat
and
this
was
the
real
fount
i
wanted
this
was
the
slow
powerful
death
i
craved
the
heart
pumping
as
if
it
would
never
stop
the
sigh
slipping
from
his
lips
my
eyes
clouded
still
even
as
i
let
him
go
with
the
fading
images
of
his
brief
and
unrecorded
life
suddenly
collapsed
into
one
rare
second
of
meaning
i
let
him
drop
now
there
was
no
meaning
there
was
only
the
light
before
me
and
the
rapture
of
the
women
who
had
at
last
been
redeemed
through
miracles
the
room
was
hushed
not
a
thing
stirred
the
sound
of
the
sea
came
in
that
distant
monotonous
booming
then
akasha
s
voice
the
sins
of
the
men
have
now
been
atoned
for
and
those
who
are
kept
now
shall
be
well
cared
for
and
loved
but
never
give
freedom
to
those
who
remain
those
who
have
oppressed
you
and
then
soundlessly
without
distinct
words
the
lesson
came
the
ravening
lust
which
they
had
just
witnessed
the
deaths
they
had
seen
at
my
hands
that
was
to
be
the
eternal
reminder
of
the
fierceness
that
lived
in
all
male
things
and
must
never
be
allowed
free
again
the
males
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
embodiment
of
their
own
violence
in
sum
these
women
had
witnessed
a
new
and
transcendent
ritual
a
new
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
and
they
would
see
it
again
and
they
must
always
remember
it
my
head
swam
from
the
paradox
and
my
own
small
designs
of
not
very
long
ago
were
there
to
torment
me
i
had
wanted
the
world
of
mortals
to
know
of
me
i
had
wanted
to
be
the
image
of
evil
in
the
theater
of
the
world
and
thereby
somehow
do
good
and
now
i
was
that
image
all
right
i
was
its
literal
embodiment
passing
through
the
minds
of
these
few
simple
souls
into
myth
as
she
had
promised
and
there
was
a
small
voice
whispering
in
my
ear
hammering
me
with
that
old
adage
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
your
wish
might
come
true
yes
that
was
the
heart
of
it
all
i
d
ever
wished
for
was
coming
true
in
the
shrine
i
had
kissed
her
and
longed
to
awaken
her
and
dreamt
of
her
power
and
now
we
stood
together
she
and
i
and
the
hymns
rose
around
us
hosannas
cries
of
joy
the
doors
of
the
palazzo
were
thrown
open
and
we
were
taking
our
leave
we
were
rising
in
splendor
and
in
magic
and
passing
out
of
the
doors
and
up
over
the
roof
of
the
old
mansion
and
then
out
over
the
sparkling
waters
into
the
calm
sweep
of
the
stars
i
had
no
fear
of
falling
anymore
i
had
no
fear
of
anything
so
insignificant
because
my
whole
soul
petty
as
it
was
and
always
had
been
knew
fears
i
d
never
imagined
before
the
story
of
the
twins
part
ii
she
was
dreaming
of
killing
it
was
a
great
dark
city
like
london
or
rome
and
she
was
hurrying
through
it
on
an
errand
of
killing
to
bring
down
the
first
sweet
human
victim
that
would
be
her
own
and
just
before
she
opened
her
eyes
she
had
made
the
leap
from
the
things
she
had
believed
all
her
life
to
this
simple
amoral
act
killing
she
had
done
what
the
reptile
does
when
it
hoists
in
its
leathery
slit
of
a
mouth
the
tiny
crying
mouse
that
it
will
crush
slowly
without
ever
hearing
that
soft
heartbreaking
song
awake
in
the
dark
and
the
house
alive
above
her
the
old
ones
saying
come
a
television
talking
somewhere
the
blessed
virgin
mary
had
appeared
on
an
island
in
the
mediterranean
sea
no
hunger
maharet
s
blood
was
too
strong
the
idea
was
growing
beckoning
like
a
crone
in
a
dark
alley
killing
rising
from
the
narrow
box
in
which
she
lay
she
tiptoed
through
the
blackness
until
her
hands
felt
the
metal
door
she
went
into
the
hallway
and
looked
up
the
endless
iron
stairs
crisscrossing
back
over
itself
as
if
it
were
a
skeleton
and
she
saw
the
sky
through
the
glass
like
smoke
mael
was
halfway
up
at
the
door
of
the
house
proper
gazing
down
at
her
she
reeled
with
it
i
am
one
of
you
and
we
are
together
and
the
feel
of
the
iron
rail
under
her
hand
and
some
sudden
grief
just
a
fleeting
thing
for
all
she
had
been
before
this
fierce
beauty
had
grabbed
her
by
the
hair
mael
came
down
as
if
to
retrieve
her
because
it
was
carrying
her
away
they
understood
did
nt
they
the
way
the
earth
breathed
for
her
now
and
the
forest
sang
and
the
roots
prowled
the
dark
coming
through
these
earthen
walls
she
stared
at
mael
faint
smell
of
buckskin
dust
how
had
she
ever
thought
such
beings
were
human
eyes
glittering
like
that
and
yet
the
time
would
come
when
she
would
be
walking
among
human
beings
again
and
she
would
see
their
eyes
linger
and
then
suddenly
move
away
she
d
be
hurrying
through
some
dark
city
like
london
or
rome
looking
into
the
eyes
of
mael
she
saw
the
crone
again
in
the
alleyway
but
it
had
not
been
a
literal
image
no
she
saw
the
alleyway
she
saw
the
killing
purely
old
james
asked
or
is
everyone
coming
here
we
re
going
to
matt
s
jamie
replied
matt
was
the
one
who
d
started
the
dancing
at
patricia
s
birthday
scarlett
remembered
her
feet
began
to
tap
maureen
smiled
at
her
i
believe
there
s
a
readiness
for
a
reel
she
said
she
picked
up
the
spoon
by
her
plate
reached
across
daniel
and
took
his
then
placing
their
bowls
back
to
back
she
held
the
tips
of
the
handles
loosely
together
and
tapped
the
spoons
against
her
palm
against
her
wrist
her
forearm
daniel
s
forehead
the
rhythm
of
the
beating
was
like
playing
the
bones
but
lighter
and
the
sheer
silliness
of
making
music
with
a
pair
of
mismatched
tablespoons
was
cause
for
delighted
spontaneous
laughter
from
scarlett
without
thinking
about
it
she
began
to
pound
on
the
table
with
her
open
hands
matching
the
beat
of
the
spoons
it
s
time
we
were
going
jamie
laughed
i
ll
get
my
fiddle
we
ll
bring
the
chairs
said
mary
kate
matt
and
katie
only
have
two
daniel
explained
to
scarlett
they
re
the
newest
o
haras
to
come
to
savannah
it
did
nt
matter
at
all
that
matt
and
katie
o
hara
s
double
parlors
held
almost
no
furniture
they
had
fireplaces
for
warmth
gaslit
ceiling
globes
for
light
and
a
broad
polished
wood
floor
for
dancing
the
hours
scarlett
passed
in
those
bare
rooms
that
saturday
were
among
the
happiest
she
d
ever
known
within
the
family
the
o
haras
shared
love
and
happiness
as
freely
and
unconsciously
as
they
shared
the
air
they
breathed
scarlett
felt
within
her
the
growth
of
something
she
had
lost
too
long
ago
to
remember
she
became
like
them
unaffected
and
spontaneous
and
open
to
carefree
joy
she
could
shed
the
artifice
and
calculation
that
she
d
learned
to
use
in
the
battles
for
conquest
and
dominance
that
were
part
of
being
a
belle
in
southern
society
she
had
no
need
to
charm
or
conquer
she
was
welcome
as
she
was
one
of
the
family
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
willing
to
relinquish
the
spotlight
to
let
someone
else
be
the
center
of
attention
the
others
were
fascinating
to
her
primarily
because
they
were
her
new
found
family
but
also
because
she
d
never
known
anyone
like
them
in
her
life
or
almost
never
scarlett
looked
at
maureen
with
brian
and
daniel
making
music
behind
her
helen
and
mary
kate
clapping
in
time
with
the
rhythm
she
was
setting
with
the
bones
and
for
a
moment
it
was
as
if
the
vivid
redheads
were
the
youthful
tarletons
come
back
to
life
the
twins
tall
and
handsome
the
girls
squirming
with
juvenile
impatience
to
move
on
to
the
next
adventure
life
held
for
them
scarlett
had
always
envied
the
tarleton
girls
their
free
and
easy
ways
with
their
mother
now
she
saw
the
same
easiness
between
maureen
and
her
children
and
she
knew
that
she
too
was
welcome
to
laugh
with
maureen
to
tease
and
be
teased
to
share
in
the
bounteous
affection
that
jamie
s
wife
showered
on
everyone
around
her
at
that
moment
scarlett
s
near
worship
of
her
serene
self
contained
mother
shivered
and
suffered
a
tiny
crack
and
she
began
to
free
herself
of
the
guilt
she
d
always
felt
because
she
could
nt
live
up
to
her
mother
s
teachings
perhaps
it
was
all
right
if
she
was
nt
a
perfect
lady
the
idea
was
too
rich
too
complicated
she
d
think
about
it
later
she
did
nt
want
to
think
about
anything
now
not
yesterday
not
tomorrow
the
only
thing
that
mattered
was
this
moment
and
the
happiness
it
held
the
music
and
singing
and
clapping
and
dancing
after
the
formal
rituals
of
charleston
s
balls
the
spontaneous
home
made
pleasures
were
intoxicating
scarlett
breathed
deep
of
the
joy
and
laughter
around
her
and
it
giddied
her
matt
s
daughter
peggy
showed
her
the
simplest
steps
of
the
reel
and
there
was
in
some
strange
way
a
rightness
to
learning
from
a
seven
year
old
child
and
a
rightness
to
the
outspoken
encouragement
and
even
the
teasing
of
the
others
adults
and
children
alike
because
it
was
the
same
for
peggy
as
it
was
for
her
she
danced
until
her
knees
were
wobbly
then
she
collapsed
laughing
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
at
old
james
feet
and
he
patted
her
head
as
if
she
were
a
puppy
and
that
made
her
laugh
all
the
more
until
she
was
gasping
for
breath
when
she
cried
out
i
m
having
so
much
fun
there
had
been
very
little
fun
in
scarlett
s
life
and
she
wanted
it
to
last
forever
this
clean
uncomplicated
joyfulness
she
looked
at
her
big
happy
cousins
and
she
was
proud
of
their
strength
and
vigor
and
talent
for
music
and
for
life
we
re
a
fine
lot
we
o
haras
there
s
none
can
touch
us
scarlett
heard
her
father
s
voice
boasting
saying
the
words
he
had
so
often
said
to
her
and
she
knew
for
the
first
time
what
he
had
meant
ah
jamie
what
a
wonderful
night
this
was
she
said
when
he
was
walking
her
home
scarlett
was
so
tired
she
was
practically
stumbling
but
she
was
chattering
like
a
magpie
too
exhilarated
to
accept
the
peaceful
silence
of
the
sleeping
city
we
re
a
fine
lot
we
o
haras
jamie
laughed
his
strong
hands
caught
her
around
the
waist
and
he
lifted
her
up
and
swung
her
in
a
giddy
circle
there
s
none
can
touch
us
he
said
when
he
set
her
down
miss
scarlett
miss
scarlett
pansy
woke
her
at
seven
with
a
message
from
her
grandfather
he
wants
you
right
this
minute
the
old
soldier
was
formally
dressed
and
fresh
shaven
he
looked
disapprovingly
at
scarlett
s
hastily
combed
hair
and
dressing
gown
from
his
imperial
position
in
the
great
armchair
at
the
head
of
the
dining
room
table
my
breakfast
good
he
could
almost
hear
coal
choking
fourteen
it
hit
him
in
the
gut
so
hard
he
sat
up
straight
and
placed
the
coffee
on
a
table
fourteen
fibbies
out
there
flashing
badges
asking
questions
and
it
was
just
a
matter
of
time
before
this
thing
got
out
fourteen
you
say
sounds
like
it
s
pretty
serious
voyles
was
unyielding
we
re
very
serious
mr
president
they
ve
been
dead
a
week
and
the
trail
s
growing
colder
we
re
tracking
leads
as
fast
as
we
can
my
men
are
working
around
the
clock
i
understand
all
that
but
how
serious
is
this
pelican
theory
damn
this
was
fun
the
brief
had
yet
to
be
sent
to
new
orleans
in
fact
new
orleans
had
not
been
contacted
he
had
instructed
eric
east
to
mail
a
copy
to
that
office
with
orders
to
quietly
ask
a
few
questions
it
was
a
dead
end
just
like
a
hundred
others
they
were
chasing
i
doubt
if
there
s
anything
to
it
mr
president
but
we
ve
got
to
check
it
out
the
wrinkles
relaxed
and
there
was
a
touch
of
a
smile
i
do
nt
have
to
tell
you
denton
how
much
this
nonsense
could
hurt
if
the
press
found
out
we
do
nt
consult
the
press
when
we
investigate
i
know
let
s
not
get
into
that
i
just
wish
you
would
back
off
this
thing
i
mean
what
the
hell
it
s
absurd
and
i
could
really
get
burned
know
what
i
m
saying
voyles
was
brutal
are
you
asking
me
to
ignore
a
suspect
mr
president
coal
leaned
toward
the
screen
no
i
m
telling
you
to
forget
this
pelican
brief
he
almost
said
it
out
loud
he
could
make
it
real
plain
for
voyles
he
could
spell
it
out
then
slap
the
dumpy
little
wretch
if
he
got
smart
but
he
was
hiding
in
a
locked
room
away
from
the
action
and
for
the
moment
he
knew
he
was
where
he
belonged
the
president
shifted
and
recrossed
his
legs
at
the
knees
come
on
denton
you
know
what
i
m
saying
there
are
bigger
fish
in
the
pond
the
press
is
watching
this
investigation
just
dying
to
find
out
who
s
a
suspect
you
know
how
they
are
i
do
nt
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
no
friends
with
the
press
even
my
own
press
secretary
dislikes
me
ha
ha
ha
forget
about
it
for
a
while
back
off
and
chase
the
real
suspects
this
thing
is
a
joke
but
it
could
embarrass
the
hell
out
of
me
denton
looked
hard
at
him
relentless
the
president
shifted
again
what
about
this
khamel
thing
sounds
pretty
good
huh
could
be
yeah
since
we
re
talking
numbers
how
many
men
have
you
assigned
to
khamel
voyles
said
fifteen
and
almost
laughed
the
president
s
mouth
fell
open
the
hottest
suspect
in
the
game
gets
fifteen
and
this
damned
pelican
thing
gets
fourteen
coal
smiled
and
shook
his
head
voyles
had
been
caught
in
his
own
lies
on
the
bottom
of
page
four
of
the
wednesday
report
eric
east
and
k
o
lewis
gave
the
number
at
thirty
not
fifteen
relax
chief
coal
whispered
to
the
screen
he
s
playing
with
you
the
president
was
anything
but
relaxed
good
god
denton
why
only
fifteen
i
thought
this
was
a
significant
break
maybe
a
few
more
than
that
i
m
running
this
investigation
mr
president
i
know
and
you
re
doing
a
fine
job
i
m
not
meddling
i
just
wish
you
d
consider
spending
your
time
elsewhere
that
s
all
when
i
read
the
pelican
brief
i
almost
vomited
if
the
press
saw
it
and
started
digging
i
d
be
crucified
so
you
re
asking
me
to
back
off
the
president
leaned
forward
and
stared
fiercely
at
voyles
i
m
not
asking
denton
i
m
telling
you
to
leave
it
alone
ignore
it
for
a
couple
of
weeks
spend
your
time
elsewhere
if
it
flares
up
again
take
another
look
i
m
still
the
boss
around
here
remember
voyles
relented
and
managed
a
tiny
smile
i
ll
make
you
a
deal
your
hatchet
man
coal
has
done
a
number
on
me
with
the
press
they
ve
eaten
my
lunch
over
the
security
we
provided
to
rosenberg
and
jensen
the
president
nodded
solemnly
you
get
that
pit
bull
off
my
ass
keep
him
away
from
me
and
i
ll
forget
the
pelican
theory
i
do
nt
make
deals
voyles
sneered
but
kept
his
cool
good
i
ll
send
fifty
agents
to
new
orleans
tomorrow
and
fifty
the
next
day
we
ll
be
flashing
badges
all
over
town
and
doing
our
damnedest
to
attract
attention
the
president
jumped
to
his
feet
and
walked
to
the
windows
overlooking
the
rose
garden
voyles
sat
motionless
and
waited
all
right
all
right
it
s
a
deal
i
can
control
fletcher
coal
voyles
stood
and
walked
slowly
to
the
desk
i
do
nt
trust
him
and
if
i
smell
him
one
more
time
during
this
investigation
the
deal
s
off
and
we
investigate
the
pelican
brief
with
all
the
weight
i
can
muster
the
president
held
up
his
hands
and
smiled
warmly
it
s
a
deal
voyles
was
smiling
and
the
president
was
smiling
and
in
the
closet
near
the
cabinet
room
fletcher
coal
was
smiling
at
a
screen
hatchet
man
pit
bull
he
loved
it
those
were
the
words
that
created
legends
he
turned
off
the
screens
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
they
would
talk
another
ten
minutes
about
the
background
checks
on
the
short
list
and
he
would
listen
in
his
office
where
he
had
audio
but
no
video
he
had
a
staff
meeting
at
nine
a
firing
at
ten
and
he
had
some
typing
to
do
with
most
memos
he
simply
dictated
into
the
machine
and
handed
the
tape
to
a
secretary
but
occasionally
coal
found
it
necessary
to
resort
to
the
phantom
memo
these
were
always
widely
circulated
in
the
west
had
nt
come
yet
tom
had
a
hell
of
a
time
keeping
charles
distracted
for
two
days
and
charles
kept
asking
tom
if
there
was
any
news
from
john
taylor
but
there
was
nt
tom
was
anxious
to
hear
from
him
himself
and
he
had
only
dared
to
call
once
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
him
in
the
office
and
taylor
sounded
exhausted
hell
man
do
you
know
what
it
s
like
to
tear
apart
sixteen
ships
we
ve
torn
up
the
whole
fucking
port
what
do
you
mean
hurry
up
and
they
had
asked
for
the
same
cooperation
from
the
port
authority
in
new
jersey
but
it
was
easier
for
them
all
they
had
in
port
at
the
moment
were
tankers
but
manhattan
was
a
snakepit
and
all
the
foreign
ships
were
furious
to
be
searched
until
they
heard
what
it
was
about
then
they
were
a
little
more
willing
to
cooperate
but
not
much
the
news
of
teddy
s
kidnapping
was
old
and
in
spite
of
the
trial
people
had
already
begun
to
forget
and
stop
caring
and
the
inconvenience
of
a
major
search
with
all
it
involved
was
monumental
they
had
even
checked
out
the
europa
which
malcolm
was
sailing
on
later
but
it
was
clean
and
the
germans
had
been
highly
annoyed
to
have
their
ship
searched
i
told
you
i
ll
call
you
if
we
get
anything
i
have
nt
been
in
my
office
since
last
night
and
i
only
came
in
to
take
a
shower
because
i
could
nt
stand
myself
anymore
you
got
any
complaints
mr
armour
taylor
was
sharp
but
tom
knew
he
did
nt
mean
any
harm
he
was
just
tired
no
complaints
just
a
nervous
client
tell
him
to
keep
his
pants
on
we
re
doing
our
best
and
will
you
do
me
a
favor
he
hesitated
and
then
decided
to
ask
him
sure
shoot
what
is
it
call
louie
the
lover
he
smiled
and
taylor
laughed
no
marielle
patterson
she
must
be
a
wreck
wondering
what
s
going
on
i
did
nt
tell
her
about
louie
getting
fifty
grand
to
plant
the
pajamas
i
just
told
her
we
had
a
new
lead
i
did
nt
want
to
get
her
excited
sure
what
ll
i
tell
her
i
do
nt
know
taylor
hesitated
and
tom
found
himself
wondering
what
his
interest
in
her
was
but
he
told
himself
he
was
too
suspicious
about
everything
he
was
turning
into
a
real
bastard
just
make
sure
she
s
all
right
patterson
s
giving
her
such
a
hard
time
he
s
divorcing
her
you
know
swell
guy
tom
was
disgusted
but
not
surprised
to
hear
it
that
s
what
i
said
he
does
nt
know
how
lucky
he
is
but
i
think
he
s
going
to
get
what
he
deserves
with
little
miss
krautland
underneath
all
that
blond
hair
she
looks
like
one
tough
cookie
may
i
quote
you
special
agent
taylor
tom
laughed
and
taylor
chuckled
tiredly
in
answer
anytime
counsellor
you
ve
got
to
admit
the
little
kraut
looked
cute
on
the
stand
though
they
both
laughed
and
taylor
went
back
to
work
reorganizing
his
agents
they
had
already
torn
apart
twelve
ships
and
they
had
four
to
go
before
the
next
morning
tom
managed
to
call
marielle
as
he
d
promised
taylor
is
there
something
particular
going
on
mr
armour
marielle
sounded
really
worried
i
keep
thinking
they
ve
had
some
kind
of
information
about
about
she
was
afraid
to
say
it
i
keep
worrying
that
they
re
going
to
find
teddy
s
body
i
guess
we
should
know
if
i
do
nt
know
which
is
worse
not
knowing
or
finally
knowing
that
it
s
over
either
one
sounded
pretty
awful
to
tom
he
still
remembered
finding
out
about
his
wife
and
the
baby
it
had
been
beyond
bearing
but
this
had
dragged
out
for
so
long
maybe
it
would
be
a
relief
to
finally
know
if
he
was
gone
instead
of
just
having
him
disappear
into
thin
air
and
never
know
it
had
taken
them
two
months
to
find
the
lindbergh
baby
i
hope
we
ll
have
good
news
for
you
soon
do
you
know
what
it
is
they
re
doing
he
did
nt
want
to
tell
her
they
were
turning
the
port
upside
down
looking
for
teddy
i
think
they
re
just
looking
into
some
final
evidence
before
we
close
it
ll
all
be
over
tomorrow
how
s
charles
taking
it
actually
tom
leaned
back
in
his
desk
chair
and
smiled
she
had
a
nice
voice
and
he
liked
talking
to
her
he
liked
everything
he
d
seen
of
her
during
the
trial
but
he
had
nt
let
himself
think
about
her
before
except
in
relation
to
his
client
actually
he
s
driving
me
crazy
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
sounds
like
charles
and
then
she
grew
serious
again
is
he
very
worried
as
worried
as
he
should
be
this
new
evidence
may
be
of
some
help
to
him
though
we
re
hoping
so
anyway
the
fbi
is
checking
it
out
for
us
we
ll
let
you
know
if
we
hear
anything
at
all
thank
you
she
was
nt
supposed
to
be
on
their
side
but
there
did
nt
seem
to
be
sides
anymore
there
was
just
everyone
searching
for
the
truth
and
for
teddy
the
next
two
days
seemed
endless
to
her
with
malcolm
away
and
john
taylor
gone
to
help
with
the
investigation
suddenly
she
had
no
one
to
talk
to
and
with
malcolm
gone
the
house
seemed
unusually
quiet
it
made
her
start
to
think
about
what
she
would
do
when
she
moved
out
she
had
nowhere
to
go
nothing
to
do
no
family
to
turn
to
in
some
ways
it
worried
her
but
she
was
nt
as
frightened
as
she
might
have
been
years
before
he
did
nt
frighten
her
anymore
suddenly
she
did
nt
care
about
him
at
all
all
he
had
done
was
hurt
her
bea
ritter
called
her
once
speakers
stored
visual
material
before
a
presentation
he
could
lock
his
material
away
there
in
the
lobby
he
passed
the
receptionist
s
desk
now
manned
by
a
black
security
guard
who
watched
a
baseball
game
and
nodded
to
sanders
sanders
went
back
toward
the
rear
of
the
floor
moving
quietly
on
the
plush
carpeting
the
hallway
was
dark
but
the
lights
were
on
in
the
conference
room
he
could
see
them
shining
from
around
the
corner
as
he
came
closer
he
heard
meredith
johnson
say
and
then
what
and
a
man
s
voice
answered
something
indistinct
sanders
paused
he
stood
in
the
dark
corridor
and
listened
from
where
he
stood
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
room
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
johnson
said
okay
so
will
mark
talk
about
design
the
man
said
yes
he
ll
cover
that
okay
johnson
said
then
what
about
the
sanders
could
nt
hear
the
rest
he
crept
forward
moving
silently
on
the
carpet
and
cautiously
peered
around
the
corner
he
still
could
not
see
into
the
conference
room
itself
but
there
was
a
large
chrome
sculpture
in
the
hallway
outside
the
room
a
sort
of
propeller
shape
and
in
the
reflection
of
its
polished
surface
he
saw
meredith
moving
in
the
room
the
man
with
her
was
blackburn
johnson
said
so
what
if
sanders
does
nt
bring
it
up
he
will
blackburn
said
you
re
sure
he
does
nt
that
the
again
the
rest
was
lost
no
he
no
idea
sanders
held
his
breath
meredith
was
pacing
her
image
in
the
reflection
twisting
and
distorted
so
when
he
does
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
is
that
you
mean
exactly
blackburn
said
and
if
he
blackburn
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
yes
you
have
to
so
want
me
to
blackburn
said
something
quiet
in
reply
and
sanders
heard
none
of
it
except
the
phrase
must
demolish
him
can
do
that
make
sure
counting
on
you
there
was
the
shrill
sound
of
a
telephone
both
meredith
and
blackburn
reached
for
their
pockets
meredith
answered
the
call
and
the
two
began
to
move
toward
the
exit
they
were
heading
toward
sanders
panicked
sanders
looked
around
and
saw
a
men
s
room
to
his
right
he
slipped
inside
the
door
as
they
came
out
of
the
conference
room
and
started
down
the
hallway
do
nt
worry
about
this
meredith
blackburn
said
it
ll
go
fine
i
m
not
worried
she
said
it
should
be
quite
smooth
and
impersonal
blackburn
said
there
s
no
reason
for
rancor
after
all
you
have
the
facts
on
your
side
he
s
clearly
incompetent
he
still
ca
nt
get
into
the
database
she
said
no
he
s
locked
out
of
the
system
and
there
s
no
way
he
can
get
into
conley
white
s
system
blackburn
laughed
no
way
in
hell
meredith
the
voices
faded
moving
down
the
hallway
sanders
strained
to
listen
finally
heard
the
click
of
a
door
closing
he
stepped
out
of
the
bathroom
into
the
hallway
the
hallway
was
deserted
he
stared
toward
the
far
door
his
own
telephone
rang
in
his
pocket
the
sound
so
loud
it
made
him
jump
he
answered
it
sanders
listen
fernandez
said
i
sent
the
draft
of
your
contract
to
blackburn
s
office
but
it
came
back
with
a
couple
of
added
statements
that
i
m
not
sure
about
i
think
we
better
meet
to
discuss
them
in
an
hour
sanders
said
why
not
now
i
have
something
to
do
first
he
said
ah
thomas
max
dorfman
opened
the
door
to
his
hotel
roomand
immediately
wheeled
away
back
toward
the
television
set
you
have
finally
decided
to
come
you
ve
heard
heard
what
dorfman
said
i
am
an
old
man
no
one
bothers
with
me
anymore
i
m
cast
by
the
wayside
by
everyone
including
you
he
clicked
off
the
television
set
and
grinned
sanders
said
what
have
you
heard
oh
just
a
few

meredith
nonsense

s
true

believe
blackburn

set
you
up
philip
blackburn
is
a
spineless
fool
he
has
no
principles
and
almost
no
brains
i
told
garvin
to
fire
him
years
ago
blackburn
is
incapable
of
original
thought
then
meredith
ali
meredith
yes
so
beautiful
such
lovely
breasts
max
please
you
thought
so
too
once
that
was
a
long
time
ago
sanders
said
dorfman
smiled
times
have
changed
he
said
with
heavy
irony
what
does
that
mean
you
are
looking
pale
thomas
i
ca
nt
figure
anything
out
i
m
scared
oh
you
re
scared
a
big
man
like
you
is
scared
of
this
beautiful
woman
with
beautiful
breasts
max
of
course
you
are
right
to
be
scared
she
has
done
all
these
many
terrible
things
to
you
she
has
tricked
you
and
manipulated
you
and
abused
you
yes
yes
sanders
said
you
have
been
victimized
by
her
and
garvin
yes
then
why
were
you
mentioning
to
me
the
flower
hmm
he
frowned
for
a
moment
he
did
nt
know
what
dorfman
was
talking
about
the
old
man
was
always
so
confusing
and
he
liked
to
be
the
flower
dorfman
said
irritably
rapping
his
knuckles
on
the
wheelchair
arm
the
stained
glass
flower
in
your
apartment
we
were
speaking
of
it
the
other
day
do
nt
tell
me
you
have
forgotten
it
the
truth
was
that
he
had
until
that
moment
then
he
remembered
the
image
of
the
stained
glass
flower
the
image
that
had
come
unbidden
to
his
mind
a
few
days
earlier
you
re
right
i
forgot
you
forgot
dorfman
s
voice
was
heavy
with
sarcasm
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
max
i
did
i
he
snorted
you
are
impossible
i
cannot
believe
you
will
behave
so
transparently
you
did
nt
forget
thomas
you
this
excursion
as
if
some
signal
period
in
life
mine
and
his
is
coming
if
not
to
a
full
close
then
at
least
toward
some
tightening
transforming
twist
in
the
kaleidoscope
a
change
i
d
be
foolish
to
take
lightly
and
do
nt
the
impulse
to
read
self
reliance
is
significant
here
as
is
the
holiday
itself
my
favorite
secular
one
for
being
public
and
for
its
implicit
goal
of
leaving
us
only
as
it
found
us
free
all
of
this
comes
in
surfeit
near
the
anniversary
of
my
divorce
a
time
when
i
routinely
feel
broody
and
insubstantial
and
spend
days
puzzling
over
that
summer
seven
years
ago
when
life
swerved
badly
and
i
somehow
at
a
loss
failed
to
right
its
course
yet
prior
to
all
that
i
m
off
this
afternoon
south
to
south
mantoloking
on
the
jersey
shore
for
my
usual
friday
evening
rendezvous
with
my
lady
friend
there
are
nt
any
politer
or
better
words
finally
blond
tall
and
leggy
sally
caldwell
though
even
here
trouble
may
be
brewing
for
ten
months
now
sally
and
i
have
carried
on
what
s
seemed
to
me
a
perfect
your
place
and
mine
romance
affording
each
other
generous
portions
of
companionship
confidence
on
an
as
needed
basis
within
reason
reliability
and
plenty
of
spicy
untranscendent
transport
all
with
ample
space
allotted
and
the
complete
presumption
of
laissez
faire
which
i
do
nt
have
much
use
for
while
remaining
fully
respectful
of
the
high
priced
lessons
and
vividly
catalogued
mistakes
of
adulthood
not
love
it
s
true
not
exactly
but
closer
to
love
than
the
puny
goods
most
married
folks
dole
out
and
yet
in
the
last
weeks
for
reasons
i
ca
nt
explain
what
i
can
only
call
a
strange
awkwardness
has
been
aroused
in
each
of
us
extending
all
the
way
to
our
usually
stirring
lovemaking
and
even
to
the
frequency
of
our
visits
as
if
the
hold
we
keep
on
the
other
s
attentions
and
affections
is
changing
and
loosening
and
it
s
now
our
business
to
form
a
new
grip
for
a
longer
more
serious
attachment
only
neither
of
us
has
yet
proved
quite
able
and
we
are
perplexed
by
the
failure
last
night
sometime
after
midnight
when
i
d
already
slept
for
an
hour
waked
up
twice
twisting
my
pillow
and
fretting
about
paul
s
and
my
journey
downed
a
glass
of
milk
watched
the
weather
channel
then
settled
back
to
read
a
chapter
of
the
declaration
of
independence
carl
becker
s
classic
which
along
with
self
reliance
i
plan
to
use
as
key
texts
for
communicating
with
my
troubled
son
and
thereby
transmitting
to
him
important
info
sally
called
these
volumes
by
the
way
are
nt
a
bit
grinding
stuffy
or
boring
the
way
they
seemed
in
school
but
are
brimming
with
useful
insightful
lessons
applicable
directly
or
metaphorically
to
the
ropy
dilemmas
of
life
hi
hi
what
s
new
she
said
a
tone
of
uneasy
restraint
in
her
usually
silky
voice
as
if
midnight
calls
were
not
our
regular
practice
which
they
are
nt
i
was
just
reading
carl
becker
who
s
terrific
i
said
though
on
alert
he
thought
that
the
whole
declaration
of
independence
was
an
attempt
to
prove
rebellion
was
the
wrong
word
for
what
the
founding
fathers
were
up
to
it
was
a
war
over
a
word
choice
that
s
pretty
amazing
she
sighed
what
was
the
right
word
oh
common
sense
nature
progress
god
s
will
karma
nirvana
it
pretty
much
all
meant
the
same
thing
to
jefferson
and
adams
and
those
guys
they
were
smarter
than
we
are
i
thought
it
was
more
important
than
that
she
said
then
she
said
life
seems
congested
to
me
just
suddenly
tonight
does
it
to
you
i
was
aware
coded
messages
were
being
sent
but
i
had
no
idea
how
to
translate
them
possibly
i
thought
this
was
an
opening
gambit
to
an
announcement
that
she
never
wanted
to
see
me
again
which
has
happened
congested
being
used
in
its
secondary
meaning
as
unbearable
something
s
crying
out
to
be
noticed
i
just
do
nt
know
what
it
is
she
said
but
it
must
have
to
do
with
you
and
i
do
nt
you
agree
well
maybe
i
said
i
do
nt
know
i
was
propped
up
by
my
bed
lamp
under
my
favorite
framed
map
of
block
island
the
musty
old
annotated
becker
on
my
chest
the
window
fan
i
ve
opted
for
no
air
conditioning
drawing
cool
sweet
suburban
midnight
onto
my
bedcovers
nothing
i
could
think
of
was
missing
right
then
besides
sleep
i
just
feel
things
are
congested
and
i
m
missing
something
sally
said
again
are
you
sure
you
do
nt
feel
that
way
you
have
to
miss
some
things
to
have
others
this
was
an
idiotic
answer
i
felt
i
might
possibly
be
asleep
but
tomorrow
still
have
a
hard
time
convincing
myself
this
conversation
had
nt
happened
which
is
also
not
that
infrequent
with
me
i
had
a
dream
tonight
sally
said
we
were
in
your
house
in
haddam
and
you
kept
neatening
everything
up
i
was
your
wife
somehow
but
i
felt
terrible
anxiety
there
was
blue
water
in
our
toilet
bowl
and
at
some
point
you
and
i
shook
hands
standing
on
your
front
steps
just
like
you
d
sold
me
your
own
house
and
then
i
saw
you
shooting
away
out
across
the
middle
of
a
big
cornfield
with
your
arms
stretched
out
like
christ
or
something
just
like
back
in
illinois
where
she
s
from
the
stolid
christian
corn
belt
it
was
peaceful
in
a
way
but
the
whole
effect
was
that
everything
was
very
very
busy
and
hectic
and
no
one
could
get
anything
done
right
and
i
felt
this
anxiety
right
in
my
dream
then
i
woke
up
and
i
wanted
to
call
you
i
m
glad
you
did
i
said
it
does
nt
sound
like
anything
that
bad
though
you
were
nt
being
chased
by
asked
for
a
piece
of
bread
i
am
sure
i
am
sorry
for
her
but
it
is
strange
how
much
some
folks
must
suffer
before
they
are
humbled
pride
must
have
a
fall
and
it
s
best
it
should
not
but
what
i
feel
for
her
mrs
hill
s
husband
was
too
much
used
to
the
talking
of
his
wife
to
give
much
heed
to
it
on
common
occasions
but
he
had
tender
feelings
and
the
sorrows
of
his
neighbour
had
touched
his
heart
yes
said
he
the
lord
knows
who
needs
it
and
though
i
do
nt
profess
to
read
the
bible
as
much
as
you
do
that
says
he
chasteneth
whom
he
loveth
and
besides
betsy
i
m
thinking
that
it
is
not
easy
always
to
understand
the
ways
of
the
lord
nor
safe
nor
charitable
to
explain
his
judgments
does
not
the
saviour
say
judge
not
lest
ye
be
judged
and
how
does
he
reprove
his
disciples
when
he
says
of
those
eighteen
men
on
whom
the
tower
of
siloam
fell
think
ye
they
were
sinners
above
all
the
men
that
dwell
in
jerusalem
betsy
was
checked
for
a
moment
albeit
unused
to
hear
her
husband
quote
the
bible
but
collecting
all
her
forces
any
a
text
here
and
there
but
it
takes
grace
to
understand
them
now
john
do
you
believe
any
thing
but
pride
could
keep
mary
hollis
out
of
her
bed
spinning
and
weaving
till
o
clock
by
the
light
of
the
fire
just
to
get
a
piece
out
of
the
loom
to
fit
her
children
for
sunday
school
when
the
ladies
charitable
society
agreed
to
clothe
all
the
poor
children
no
no
john
destruction
is
sure
to
come
after
pride
for
solomon
says
the
lord
will
destroy
the
house
of
the
proud
yes
said
john
and
establish
the
border
of
the
widow
and
a
blessing
i
believe
is
in
store
for
mary
hollis
if
every
woman
was
like
her
it
would
not
take
some
hard
days
work
for
you
and
i
to
pay
our
poor
s
tax
this
was
an
argument
which
had
some
weight
with
mrs
hill
far
be
it
from
me
she
said
to
discourage
that
people
feel
their
situation
if
mary
hollis
had
been
like
other
people
i
should
not
blame
her
for
working
hard
but
never
could
i
get
one
word
out
of
her
about
her
troubles
she
never
owned
that
her
husband
drank
that
is
never
said
any
thing
about
it
and
many
a
time
when
he
had
one
of
his
frolics
i
have
been
there
to
have
a
little
neighbour
like
talk
with
her
to
tell
her
how
much
every
body
pitied
her
and
that
such
troubles
were
not
sent
upon
her
for
nothing
she
would
say
that
what
troubles
she
had
it
was
easier
for
her
to
bear
than
to
complain
of
and
then
she
never
failed
to
turn
to
talking
about
something
else
oh
it
is
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
to
see
any
body
so
wilful
john
certainly
did
not
think
silence
a
provocation
nor
his
wife
quite
a
saint
but
his
reply
which
perhaps
would
have
had
the
return
of
little
sally
who
came
to
say
her
mother
would
be
obliged
to
mr
hill
to
ask
mr
germain
the
minister
to
call
at
her
mother
s
and
her
mother
would
be
glad
to
speak
with
mrs
hill
betsy
hill
mollified
by
the
expectation
of
confidence
was
not
a
little
chagrined
when
she
found
all
mrs
hollis
wished
was
to
effect
an
exchange
of
commodities
with
her
to
supply
the
present
necessities
of
her
children
she
offered
mrs
hill
her
best
gown
the
relict
of
better
days
for
some
pork
and
potatoes
betsy
was
not
thought
a
hard
hearted
woman
but
no
occasion
ever
tempted
her
to
discredit
her
sense
by
making
a
bad
bargain
and
as
selfishness
is
too
apt
to
make
us
overvalue
our
own
possessions
her
bargains
were
not
always
strictly
just
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
gown
and
many
remarks
upon
the
damages
done
by
time
the
present
reduced
price
of
goods
c
to
all
which
mrs
hollis
listened
patiently
adjusted
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
parties
it
was
a
principle
with
mary
never
to
beg
while
she
could
by
any
exertion
or
self
denial
do
without
it
but
no
one
could
more
gratefully
receive
a
kindness
the
minister
of
the
village
was
in
the
gospel
sense
the
overseer
of
his
flock
his
first
duty
he
knew
was
to
minister
to
their
spiritual
wants
but
that
being
done
he
did
not
leave
the
rest
undone
his
benevolent
heart
was
continually
devising
good
and
his
strong
practical
mind
contriving
some
mode
for
its
application
his
wife
was
a
fellow
worker
with
him
and
the
sobriety
industry
and
order
of
their
household
were
an
excellent
comment
on
the
public
preaching
of
the
pastor
no
scoffer
could
ever
say
mr
germain
knew
how
to
preach
better
than
to
practice
no
infidel
could
point
you
in
derision
to
his
family
as
exemplifiying
the
impotence
of
the
principles
he
taught
but
a
numerous
family
early
inured
to
temperance
obedience
and
love
exhibited
the
blessedness
of
a
well
ordered
household
his
people
witnessing
the
effects
of
his
wisdom
had
confidence
in
it
and
sought
in
all
cases
of
difficulty
in
their
temporal
affairs
his
advice
and
many
there
were
among
them
who
referred
the
prosperity
of
their
families
to
the
salutary
counsels
of
their
beloved
pastor
the
good
man
had
anticipated
the
wants
of
mary
and
was
already
on
his
way
to
her
when
he
met
hill
they
naturally
fell
into
conversation
on
mary
s
embarrassments
hill
said
that
a
lone
woman
as
she
was
and
none
of
the
strongest
she
must
put
her
children
upon
the
town
that
her
husband
though
he
was
bad
enough
had
contributed
something
to
the
support
of
his
family
but
if
his
wife
had
not
been
the
best
christian
in
the
world
they
could
never
have
kept
it
together
of
the
wood
mr
lloyd
had
no
family
ties
to
philadelphia
he
preferred
a
country
life
not
supinely
to
dream
away
existence
but
he
hoped
there
to
cultivate
and
employ
a
talent
for
doing
good
that
talent
which
a
noble
adventurer
declared
he
most
valued
and
which
though
there
is
a
field
for
its
exercise
wherever
any
members
of
the
human
family
are
he
compassed
sea
and
land
to
find
new
worlds
in
which
to
expend
it
mr
lloyd
purchased
the
place
and
morning
of
the
sale
by
jane
and
her
friend
mary
chapter
iv
she
half
an
angel
in
her
own
account
doubts
not
hereafter
with
the
saints
to
mount
tho
not
a
grace
appears
on
strictest
search
but
that
she
fasts
and
item
goes
to
church
cowper
the
excellent
character
of
mary
hull
had
been
spoken
of
to
mr
lloyd
by
his
landlady
and
he
was
convinced
that
she
was
precisely
the
person
to
whom
he
should
be
satisfied
to
commit
the
superintendence
of
his
family
accordingly
on
the
evening
of
the
sale
he
sent
a
messenger
to
mrs
wilson
s
with
the
following
note
robert
lloyd
having
purchased
the
place
of
the
late
mr
elton
would
be
glad
to
engage
mary
hull
to
take
charge
of
his
family
wages
and
all
other
matters
shall
be
arranged
to
her
satisfaction
he
takes
the
liberty
to
send
by
the
messenger
for
jane
elton
a
work
box
dressing
glass
and
a
few
other
small
articles
for
which
she
will
do
him
the
favour
to
retain
on
account
of
the
value
they
must
have
in
her
eyes
mrs
wilson
had
no
notion
that
any
right
could
be
prior
to
hers
in
her
house
she
took
the
note
from
the
servant
and
notwithstanding
he
ventured
to
say
he
believed
it
was
not
meant
for
her
she
read
it
first
with
no
very
satisfied
air
and
then
turning
to
one
of
the
children
she
told
her
to
call
mary
hull
to
her
the
servant
placed
the
things
on
the
table
and
left
the
room
so
said
she
to
jane
who
was
looking
at
her
for
some
explanation
of
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
work
box
c
so
miss
you
have
seen
fit
to
disobey
the
first
order
i
took
the
trouble
to
give
you
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
dared
to
leave
these
things
after
my
positive
orders
i
did
not
understand
your
note
ma
am
to
contain
positive
orders
and
mary
take
the
things
right
pretty
judges
of
right
to
be
sure
she
a
hired
a
girl
and
a
methodist
into
the
bargain
i
do
nt
know
how
she
dares
to
judge
over
my
head
and
you
miss
i
tell
you
once
for
all
i
allow
no
child
in
my
house
to
know
right
from
wrong
children
have
no
reason
and
they
ought
to
be
very
thankful
when
they
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
that
are
capable
of
judging
for
them
here
said
she
to
mary
who
now
entered
in
obedience
to
her
summons
here
is
a
proposal
of
a
place
for
you
from
that
quaker
that
buried
his
wife
last
week
i
suppose
you
call
yourself
your
own
mistress
and
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
it
but
as
you
are
yet
a
young
woman
mary
hull
and
this
man
is
a
quaker
widower
and
nobody
knows
who
i
should
think
it
a
great
risk
for
you
to
live
with
him
you
may
be
sure
there
is
not
a
person
in
this
town
that
wo
nt
think
you
are
trying
to
get
him
for
a
husband
mary
was
highly
gratified
with
the
thought
of
returning
to
the
place
where
she
had
passed
a
large
and
happy
portion
of
her
life
and
she
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
she
should
not
stand
so
much
in
her
own
light
as
to
refuse
so
excellent
a
place
that
from
all
she
had
heard
said
of
mr
lloyd
he
was
a
gentleman
far
above
her
condition
in
life
and
therefore
she
thought
no
person
would
be
silly
enough
to
suppose
she
took
the
place
from
so
foolish
a
design
as
mrs
wilson
suggested
and
she
should
take
care
that
her
conduct
should
give
no
occasion
for
reproach
well
said
mrs
wilson
chagrined
that
her
counsel
was
not
compulsory
it
does
amaze
me
to
see
how
some
people
strain
at
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
mary
did
not
condescend
to
notice
this
remark
but
proceeded
which
she
succeeded
in
doing
without
any
further
remark
from
mrs
wilson
who
prudently
restrained
the
exercise
of
her
authority
while
there
was
one
present
independent
enough
to
oppose
its
current
oh
mary
said
jane
when
they
were
alone
how
glad
i
am
you
are
going
to
live
with
such
a
good
man
how
happy
you
must
be
and
i
too
mary
and
she
hastily
brushed
away
a
tear
i
am
at
least
i
should
be
very
happy
when
i
have
such
a
kind
friend
as
you
are
so
near
to
me
yes
yes
dear
jane
try
to
be
happy
this
foolish
aunt
of
yours
will
try
you
like
the
fire
but
i
look
to
see
you
come
out
of
it
as
gold
from
the
furnace
keep
up
a
good
heart
my
child
it
is
a
long
lane
that
never
turns
the
friends
separated
but
not
till
mary
had
with
her
usual
caution
carefully
packed
away
jane
s
that
it
was
best
to
put
temptation
out
of
sight
mary
s
plain
and
neat
appearance
and
her
ingenuous
sensible
countenance
commended
her
at
once
to
mr
lloyd
s
favour
and
she
entered
immediately
upon
the
duties
of
her
new
and
responsible
situation
we
must
now
introduce
those
who
are
willing
to
go
further
with
us
in
the
history
of
jane
elton
to
the
family
of
mrs
wilson
where
they
will
see
she
had
a
school
for
the
discipline
of
christian
character
jane
said
mrs
wilson
to
her
on
the
morning
after
mary
s
departure
you
know
better
fitted
to
make
me
the
wife
that
i
ought
to
have
had
than
any
that
i
ever
met
with
her
thought
was
like
mine
but
better
her
ambition
like
mine
but
less
terrible
and
more
religious
her
more
rational
but
as
deep
and
as
breathless
as
my
own
for
her
she
is
now
married
heaven
bless
and
protect
her
reader
it
is
all
in
vain
i
can
not
tell
the
story
in
any
other
way
than
as
it
occurs
to
my
memory
by
fits
and
starts
i
can
not
preserve
any
chronological
order
i
can
only
record
my
own
associations
bear
with
me
chapter
xiii
hammond
the
dwarf
sammy
kelly
confoundedly
scared
apparition
unfinished
sentence
hammond
s
temper
patience
strength
courage
self
possession
readiness
i
have
already
spoken
of
hammond
the
dwarf
it
is
now
time
that
i
speak
more
plainly
for
the
hour
is
arrived
when
there
is
not
an
event
of
my
life
to
be
related
in
which
he
had
not
in
some
way
directly
or
indirectly
a
strange
wayward
influence
let
me
begin
early
when
i
first
knew
that
i
hated
him
it
was
in
my
earliest
the
spiteful
little
devil
my
brother
sampson
achilles
otherwise
called
sammy
kelly
and
of
the
life
that
i
led
at
home
such
was
my
deadly
antipathy
to
the
creature
at
last
that
my
blood
would
curdle
if
my
flesh
touched
his
much
as
if
i
had
trod
with
my
naked
foot
upon
a
toad
the
wicked
readiness
and
dexterity
of
the
imp
are
inconceivable
i
had
ten
times
his
strength
and
ten
times
at
least
have
i
saved
his
life
when
he
was
utterly
at
the
mercy
of
some
beast
or
carriage
for
not
a
dog
would
pass
by
the
door
where
he
sat
with
his
tongue
lolling
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
long
white
fingers
clotted
and
ringed
with
bruised
and
broken
worms
not
a
dog
that
did
nt
stop
to
bark
at
or
worry
him
yet
more
than
once
have
i
been
on
the
point
i
may
as
well
own
the
truth
of
provoking
one
at
when
i
was
dragging
him
out
of
some
puddle
he
was
a
beast
a
monster
in
all
but
intellect
and
that
was
instinctively
devilish
his
seat
in
the
door
way
on
the
steps
in
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
was
coloured
with
glittering
insects
that
he
had
crushed
and
stuck
to
the
floor
or
strewed
all
over
with
the
hair
of
cats
or
the
feathers
of
young
birds
that
he
had
picked
naked
yet
poor
thing
it
was
never
thought
possible
that
he
could
harm
anybody
and
when
i
have
been
tempted
to
pitch
him
into
a
kettle
of
hot
soap
or
an
empty
flour
barrel
for
his
cursed
pranks
upon
elizabeth
i
have
been
withheld
solely
by
a
doubt
that
he
might
by
some
possibility
have
some
sort
of
a
rational
soul
or
that
he
was
too
much
of
a
devil
to
be
hurt
by
it
up
to
the
hilt
has
he
driven
a
little
sharp
pen
knife
into
like
a
strangling
baboon
again
and
again
has
he
blistered
me
with
hot
water
and
once
it
was
well
nigh
the
last
moment
of
his
life
did
he
throw
a
crucible
of
melted
lead
at
poor
elizabeth
when
she
was
very
little
a
part
of
which
fell
upon
her
foot
and
burnt
and
sunk
into
it
till
her
shrieks
could
have
been
heard
for
a
mile
yet
when
i
was
only
going
to
pour
the
rest
of
it
down
his
own
ugly
throat
some
fool
or
other
my
uncle
or
father
perhaps
interfered
and
had
well
nigh
poured
it
down
mine
for
meddling
with
the
poor
innocent
as
if
hot
lead
from
his
hand
would
nt
burn
a
fellow
but
i
taught
him
a
better
lesson
at
last
he
hurled
a
brick
at
me
i
just
took
him
by
the
nape
o
the
neck
he
had
another
in
his
hand
which
in
his
childish
to
throw
into
my
face
and
eyes
but
i
only
took
hold
of
his
neck
and
he
yelled
out
much
as
if
a
red
hot
blacksmith
s
vice
had
caught
him
there
and
dropped
the
brick
never
no
never
after
that
did
he
venture
to
lift
his
hand
against
me
when
we
were
alone
i
learnt
how
to
manage
him
in
some
degree
from
that
moment
for
idiot
that
he
was
he
was
not
so
very
a
beast
as
to
repeat
what
he
knew
would
end
in
pain
to
himself
and
but
for
elizabeth
whom
he
tortured
incessantly
in
one
way
or
another
worrying
her
with
vermin
and
bugs
filling
all
her
little
boxes
and
playthings
with
whatever
was
most
hateful
to
her
i
should
have
gone
on
peaceable
enough
i
have
thumped
him
for
it
till
he
was
spotted
all
over
choked
him
for
it
till
his
eyes
were
starting
out
of
their
sockets
but
and
the
moment
that
my
back
was
turned
he
would
be
at
his
mischief
again
growling
all
the
time
like
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
about
this
time
just
when
i
had
pretty
well
made
up
my
mind
to
let
the
next
dog
that
should
attempt
it
throttle
him
at
his
leisure
i
happened
to
be
out
late
of
a
holiday
afternoon
in
a
dismal
wood
dark
and
swampy
and
tangled
where
i
had
gone
after
black
whortleberries
it
was
already
dusk
i
was
alone
and
had
far
to
go
and
withal
was
a
terrible
coward
as
i
have
already
told
you
i
was
just
clambering
over
a
high
fence
i
remember
with
the
dish
in
my
hand
full
of
whortleberries
and
getting
ready
to
leap
when
i
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
dropped
them
below
me
were
a
pair
of
large
rolling
eyes
of
frightful
vividness
it
was
a
creature
with
a
big
head
sa
sa
sammy
dear
cried
i
as
soon
as
i
could
get
my
breath
is
it
you
sammy
i
was
never
so
glad
of
attempt
her
own
life
before
she
was
twelve
years
of
age
and
her
beauty
was
so
extraordinary
that
an
agent
of
the
royal
government
to
the
last
colonial
governour
of
massachusetts
mentions
it
in
one
of
his
official
despatches
of
the
day
as
absolutely
wonderful
and
miraculous
he
himself
lived
to
see
her
a
corpse
she
loved
and
the
passion
of
love
in
such
her
parents
discovered
it
she
fled
to
the
woods
went
among
the
indians
was
found
almost
naked
and
squalid
with
suffering
and
sickness
brought
home
confined
tempted
but
all
in
vain
her
last
words
were
let
me
go
free
treat
me
kindly
and
i
never
will
see
him
again
without
your
consent
but
treat
me
in
any
other
way
and
my
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
they
left
her
taking
care
to
secure
the
doors
and
windows
and
removing
all
possible
means
of
self
destruction
as
they
thought
even
to
the
bed
cords
and
the
bed
linen
and
the
glass
but
when
they
came
to
the
door
in
the
morning
and
tried
to
open
it
they
found
it
fastened
within
they
called
it
was
frightfully
still
they
burst
it
open
she
was
found
dead
lying
flat
upon
the
floor
with
her
face
swollen
and
discoloured
though
very
beautiful
had
she
died
who
that
ever
lived
could
have
done
the
same
thing
i
have
known
one
case
like
it
since
that
of
a
man
who
sat
down
and
leaned
his
throat
against
a
rope
until
it
strangled
him
a
second
was
quite
as
terrible
nay
a
thousand
time
more
terrible
than
this
it
was
the
case
of
an
uncle
on
his
father
s
side
his
name
was
augustine
he
was
a
proud
wayward
melancholy
man
he
was
married
and
had
five
children
he
kept
company
with
nobody
and
nobody
knew
whither
he
went
sometimes
for
days
together
he
would
take
up
his
rifle
strike
into
the
woods
without
giving
his
family
any
notice
or
preparing
them
for
it
by
any
symptom
of
departure
no
one
knew
where
to
look
for
him
and
nobody
dared
to
enquire
for
he
was
known
to
have
shot
several
indians
and
one
white
man
under
pretence
of
mistaking
him
for
an
indian
a
time
of
great
peril
to
the
white
settlers
at
last
he
grew
jealous
of
his
wife
yet
nobody
knew
it
till
after
his
death
for
she
loved
him
passionately
though
she
trembled
before
him
he
was
the
handsomest
man
of
his
day
i
have
heard
several
people
declare
who
knew
him
tall
square
shouldered
with
an
eye
like
the
bald
eagle
and
an
arm
like
that
of
the
panther
at
last
he
determined
to
die
and
that
the
woman
of
his
heart
might
feel
it
he
determined
to
die
by
the
hand
of
her
own
children
those
very
children
whose
legitimacy
he
never
could
have
doubted
if
he
had
not
been
a
madman
for
every
one
of
them
was
the
talk
of
the
whole
county
round
for
his
beauty
and
courage
one
day
when
his
wife
had
gone
to
a
neighbour
s
he
put
on
his
wedding
clothes
dressed
himself
with
great
care
collected
a
great
quantity
of
brush
wood
the
whole
with
the
driest
that
he
could
find
and
leaving
a
small
hole
just
large
enough
to
admit
his
body
he
then
disposed
about
the
cabin
all
the
little
pleasant
endearing
relicks
of
early
affection
that
he
had
left
and
commanded
the
largest
boy
to
go
to
the
house
for
some
fire
the
boy
refused
for
there
was
something
he
said
so
frightful
in
his
father
s
look
that
he
was
afraid
to
leave
him
alone
at
last
however
he
consented
and
brought
the
fire
that
done
the
father
kissed
all
the
children
embraced
them
all
wept
upon
them
all
told
them
to
be
good
to
their
mother
and
to
love
the
baby
the
child
then
at
the
breast
which
was
the
real
cause
of
all
that
he
had
done
and
then
made
the
second
child
set
fire
to
the
brush
wood
it
was
all
in
a
roaring
blaze
in
a
moment
the
pitch
and
rosin
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
the
children
fled
screaming
to
the
woods
and
the
neighbours
afar
off
suspecting
that
the
indians
were
upon
them
blew
their
horns
and
mustered
man
and
horse
in
every
direction
and
kept
pouring
in
to
the
rescue
they
found
the
wretched
man
and
tore
him
out
of
the
flames
in
spite
of
all
his
powerful
resistance
and
half
suffocating
curses
but
he
broke
away
from
them
again
and
threw
himself
into
the
blaze
they
were
reinforced
and
at
last
succeeded
in
extinguishing
the
flames
and
dragging
him
out
with
a
great
part
of
his
body
burnt
to
a
coal
he
could
hardly
utter
a
sound
but
the
noise
of
cursing
and
bitter
reproach
was
continually
issuing
from
his
whole
chest
which
was
outwardly
consumed
so
that
the
motion
of
his
lungs
could
be
seen
agitating
and
convulsing
the
cinders
that
still
adhered
to
his
whole
body
yet
he
did
not
were
fools
and
deserved
death
to
them
and
theirs
for
their
meddling
that
he
had
been
sold
to
his
master
who
would
call
at
eleven
the
next
day
for
him
that
if
they
had
let
him
die
in
his
own
way
his
body
and
soul
both
would
have
been
consumed
and
the
master
outwitted
the
most
remarkable
circumstance
after
all
perhaps
was
that
precisely
at
eleven
the
next
day
he
died
but
the
other
case
in
the
same
family
was
if
possible
more
terrible
yet
and
a
thousand
times
more
affecting
one
would
be
led
to
think
that
a
judgment
was
upon
the
family
for
none
of
them
seemed
to
die
if
i
may
trust
to
the
manuscript
in
a
natural
way
perhaps
however
it
was
only
a
constitutional
predisposition
to
blood
a
derangement
that
led
to
bloodshed
the
last
was
the
case
of
a
younger
sister
whom
i
well
recollect
for
the
to
the
of
which
she
was
terribly
afraid
arose
and
shook
himself
near
her
but
he
appeared
instantly
to
recognize
her
and
lay
down
again
with
a
sullen
growl
she
came
to
the
gate
it
was
fastened
a
thing
that
she
might
have
known
and
she
had
not
the
power
to
unfasten
it
there
was
a
hole
cut
through
to
let
the
dog
out
and
in
however
and
through
that
hole
literally
upon
her
face
she
finally
squeezed
herself
her
lover
was
at
hand
they
ascended
the
carriage
and
were
soon
beyond
the
reach
of
pursuit
search
warrants
under
the
state
authority
were
taken
out
and
the
whole
country
was
ransacked
for
her
she
fell
sick
with
terrour
and
fatigue
it
was
impossible
that
she
could
be
married
in
that
state
and
it
was
necessary
in
her
timidity
that
being
together
and
that
they
should
sleep
at
least
in
the
same
room
during
her
illness
she
recovered
but
her
ruin
was
accomplished
he
spoke
of
marriage
but
perhaps
it
was
fancy
she
thought
that
his
eyes
contradicted
his
words
and
she
refused
to
marry
him
they
lived
together
she
bore
him
two
children
but
the
arrow
of
remorse
was
in
her
heart
she
besought
a
reconciliation
she
was
accepted
returned
to
her
home
but
there
was
no
comfort
their
very
kindness
was
a
reproach
to
her
yet
she
bore
it
bore
the
solitude
of
shame
and
desolation
for
a
long
time
till
she
was
insulted
insulted
and
desperate
with
passion
she
abjured
her
home
forever
and
fled
again
to
the
bosom
of
her
destroyer
it
was
then
that
i
met
her
she
was
delirious
beset
on
all
sides
and
ready
to
raise
her
hand
against
her
own
life
i
only
one
way
i
must
acquire
an
absolute
dominion
over
her
i
must
make
her
love
me
love
me
better
than
aught
in
heaven
or
earth
i
succeeded
but
before
i
tell
you
what
were
the
consequences
allow
me
to
relate
one
or
two
anecdotes
it
will
show
you
the
character
of
her
mind
and
temper
when
quite
a
child
she
took
her
little
sweetheart
by
the
hand
and
journied
with
him
all
over
the
city
after
a
man
to
marry
them
they
met
an
aged
friend
please
to
tell
us
sir
said
she
sobbing
where
the
man
lives
that
marries
people
the
good
man
put
them
on
their
way
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
without
further
questioning
but
they
were
lost
it
grew
dark
and
she
and
her
little
cousin
and
her
future
betrayer
all
nestled
and
cuddled
together
upon
some
steps
and
crying
lustily
were
found
by
an
older
cousin
in
the
name
of
wonder
said
he
children
where
have
you
come
from
what
are
you
doing
we
have
been
to
to
to
get
ma
ma
ri
ed
was
the
reply
the
other
anecdote
follows
she
lived
alone
in
a
deserted
house
a
murder
had
been
committed
in
the
next
room
she
dreamt
one
night
that
the
devil
appeared
at
her
bed
side
and
bade
her
awake
and
get
up
for
he
wanted
some
conversation
with
her
she
was
a
good
deal
frightened
at
first
though
the
devil
was
a
handsome
gentlemanly
looking
fellow
enough
but
he
bade
her
be
quiet
and
assured
her
that
he
had
no
other
business
than
a
little
chat
with
her
she
arose
went
into
the
next
room
kindled
a
roaring
fire
and
the
devil
placed
a
chair
for
her
in
one
corner
and
another
for
himself
opposite
he
was
quite
said
she
i
can
not
believe
that
you
are
the
devil
let
s
see
your
foot
come
up
with
your
hoof
he
gave
a
sort
of
a
whisk
and
put
his
hoof
in
her
lap
lord
as
i
am
alive
so
it
is
well
you
are
the
devil
sure
enough
but
after
all
quite
an
agreeable
one
so
stop
said
he
do
you
see
that
brick
mark
it
she
obeyed
she
took
a
nail
and
scratched
it
under
that
brick
said
the
devil
is
a
pot
of
money
good
night
he
arose
and
stood
in
the
door
way
holding
on
by
the
top
of
the
door
which
was
partly
open
the
light
shone
on
his
face
it
was
very
terrible
in
that
room
said
he
there
in
that
further
corner
man
dies
every
night
at
twelve
o
clock
i
come
to
meet
him
it
is
now
nearly
twelve
she
awoke
a
bright
fire
was
burning
in
the
next
room
where
there
was
no
fire
and
no
wood
when
she
went
to
bed
there
were
the
two
chairs
placed
exactly
as
she
dreamt
she
looked
for
the
brick
it
was
marked
with
the
nail
and
the
watchman
that
instant
cried
twelve
o
clock
under
her
window
she
crept
into
bed
in
an
agony
of
fear
she
lay
there
quaking
with
flashes
of
fire
and
smoke
passing
before
her
shut
eyes
continually
until
day
light
when
she
arose
and
took
up
the
brick
and
dug
till
the
foundations
of
the
chimney
were
loosened
and
she
expected
it
to
fall
upon
her
head
every
moment
but
she
found
no
money
and
never
slept
in
the
house
afterward
i
studied
her
mind
i
formed
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
me
she
acceded
i
revealed
it
distinctly
to
the
dearest
friend
that
i
had
on
earth
but
i
showed
her
the
letter
no
said
she
here
is
my
last
trial
every
thing
in
heaven
and
earth
for
me
depends
upon
this
throw
i
will
never
make
it
unless
with
the
front
of
innocence
if
your
friend
know
the
truth
how
can
i
meet
him
he
may
not
have
the
charity
for
me
that
you
have
he
may
have
his
friend
too
and
my
shame
is
publick
the
moment
that
i
appear
no
abandon
me
if
you
will
i
have
no
claim
upon
you
you
have
saved
my
life
it
is
true
and
i
am
ready
to
lay
it
down
at
your
bidding
but
i
will
never
advance
from
him
for
ever
at
a
word
me
god
i
did
not
know
it
myself
it
was
long
and
long
after
that
i
learnt
it
and
then
i
dared
not
tell
the
truth
he
had
married
me
because
he
saw
my
flesh
lacerated
my
lips
torn
and
my
wrists
stained
with
the
iron
that
bound
me
i
knew
not
the
reason
and
i
told
the
tale
as
it
appeared
to
me
gracious
heaven
will
it
be
believed
that
my
father
had
concealed
the
tremendous
disorder
from
my
first
husband
and
that
i
a
lunatick
was
married
in
the
holy
church
to
a
man
that
loved
me
o
i
can
not
tell
thee
how
fervently
it
was
our
hereditary
disorder
but
my
father
was
ambitious
i
had
discovered
this
might
not
molton
and
if
he
did
would
he
not
avail
himself
of
it
to
part
with
me
forever
and
fly
to
thee
the
thought
haunted
me
night
and
day
before
plot
was
matured
jane
and
matilda
and
i
prepared
the
infernal
ingredients
and
thy
husband
stood
by
holding
thy
hand
over
them
while
a
priest
muttered
his
incantation
juliet
there
were
faces
other
than
of
this
earth
seen
in
the
smoke
of
the
church
that
morning
and
there
were
living
creatures
near
thee
as
the
benediction
was
pronounced
and
when
that
faint
sickness
of
the
heart
came
over
thee
i
was
there
even
i
then
i
was
secure
but
where
when
can
the
guilty
say
this
cold
sweats
were
upon
me
night
and
day
edward
waxed
thinner
and
thinner
every
hour
and
every
hour
i
felt
as
if
my
heart
had
been
thrown
into
a
coil
of
tangled
serpents
hungry
and
i
could
fancy
that
the
blood
dripped
from
their
jaws
continually
like
fire
upon
the
wound
many
times
i
was
ready
to
throw
myself
at
the
feet
of
edward
and
confess
the
whole
of
it
and
that
he
forgave
me
the
cruellest
thing
of
all
only
from
discovering
by
an
interview
with
mr
grenville
that
weak
as
he
had
been
in
this
affair
nay
wicked
as
he
had
been
he
was
naturally
a
good
man
and
well
fitted
to
make
thee
happy
i
know
that
he
meditated
terrible
things
i
know
it
for
he
sat
up
all
one
night
and
his
face
was
tremendously
stern
and
pale
that
was
the
crisis
he
forgave
me
it
was
after
he
had
seen
your
husband
but
your
husband
died
i
am
revengeful
but
i
am
generous
my
mother
was
a
spanish
woman
i
inherited
her
hot
blood
but
my
father
was
an
englishman
an
honour
to
his
country
i
inherited
his
lordly
nature
it
was
time
for
me
now
to
do
my
part
i
thought
of
it
long
and
long
before
the
news
of
your
husband
s
death
came
to
me
but
remainder
of
that
very
poison
which
i
had
given
to
edward
three
years
before
that
done
i
sent
for
him
and
told
him
all
he
was
frightfully
agitated
at
first
but
in
a
little
while
accursed
thought
it
appeared
to
me
that
he
was
thinking
already
of
his
reward
i
could
read
juliet
in
his
very
eyes
but
witnesses
were
near
and
i
told
him
in
vengeance
as
much
as
in
honesty
that
he
had
been
the
husband
of
a
mad
woman
he
affected
not
to
believe
me
but
the
blow
went
home
home
i
felt
his
heart
stagger
and
heard
the
blood
rush
out
of
it
as
i
whispered
the
truth
in
his
ear
pity
me
juliet
pity
me
i
was
born
for
something
better
than
i
am
pity
me
but
i
had
written
this
all
but
the
few
last
lines
them
i
have
now
added
while
he
and
your
and
my
girl
is
at
the
door
all
is
now
over
they
are
returning
one
moment
juliet
i
could
have
loved
thee
dear
nay
i
do
love
thee
even
at
this
moment
farewell
farewell
remember
that
my
guilt
is
one
of
madness
and
of
love
canst
thou
understand
it
thou
canst
o
how
he
used
to
talk
of
thee
in
his
sleep
it
was
hard
to
bear
juliet
but
but
i
forgive
thee
and
bless
thee
helen
letter
no
iii
enclosed
this
will
be
given
to
you
my
dear
juliet
only
in
the
event
of
my
death
an
event
which
i
am
sure
is
much
nearer
than
either
has
been
dreaming
of
read
it
therefore
as
the
last
confession
of
a
dying
man
a
husband
too
to
his
wife
the
father
it
may
be
of
a
babe
already
born
to
thee
and
to
obtain
thee
juliet
i
permitted
a
system
of
cruelty
and
perfidy
to
continue
long
and
long
after
i
came
to
the
knowledge
of
it
for
this
my
love
my
reverence
my
passionate
tenderness
for
thee
are
no
excuse
but
i
had
not
the
heart
to
break
up
a
conspiracy
and
betray
the
plotters
of
thy
ruin
into
thy
hands
while
i
saw
so
much
probable
advantage
to
myself
in
permitting
it
to
continue
nor
is
this
all
juliet
i
participated
not
only
by
my
silence
but
actually
with
my
countenance
and
behaviour
for
this
i
do
repent
me
bitterly
in
dust
and
ashes
this
it
is
juliet
that
has
troubled
my
sleep
even
at
thy
side
this
that
has
fevered
and
parched
my
lips
and
sunk
my
temples
dimmed
my
eyes
and
turned
my
black
hair
gray
within
one
little
year
what
has
it
not
cost
me
to
conceal
my
own
villany
much
that
baseness
of
molton
is
false
more
of
it
is
so
discoloured
and
distorted
that
it
is
no
longer
the
same
and
many
times
dear
when
thy
tears
have
fallen
upon
my
arm
and
thy
bosom
hath
heaved
unsteadily
all
the
live
long
night
when
both
were
pretending
to
be
asleep
have
i
heard
or
fancied
that
the
movement
of
thy
sweet
lips
had
the
sound
of
molton
in
it
and
then
i
have
been
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
throwing
myself
moment
with
the
the
hewers
of
wood
and
the
drawers
of
water
to
a
patrician
rabble
and
a
profligate
king
but
why
was
not
washington
pursued
further
the
shores
of
the
delaware
were
encumbered
with
materials
for
the
construction
of
rafts
and
platforms
and
he
himself
in
a
letter
to
congress
declared
that
nothing
but
the
infatuation
of
the
enemy
saved
him
some
have
pretended
to
say
that
sir
william
howe
was
not
seriously
disposed
to
destroy
washington
but
the
truth
probably
is
that
he
was
a
cautious
commander
knew
not
the
strength
of
our
army
or
rather
its
weakness
and
was
unwilling
to
cross
a
broad
and
rapid
river
with
a
division
that
could
could
not
be
readily
supported
if
washington
should
turn
upon
it
supported
by
a
general
rising
of
the
country
sir
william
howe
has
been
blamed
for
his
circumspection
burgoyne
for
his
impetuosity
cornwallis
for
one
can
hardly
tell
what
any
thing
in
short
that
would
exhonerate
his
country
from
the
disgrace
of
being
beaten
by
be
the
best
troops
upon
the
earth
yet
after
all
there
was
something
inexplicable
not
only
in
the
movements
of
general
howe
and
lord
cornwallis
but
in
those
of
washington
at
this
time
for
the
former
but
for
the
destruction
of
a
little
bridge
over
the
raritan
would
certainly
have
taken
our
baggage
and
when
the
latter
did
not
move
from
princeton
until
cornwallis
was
within
three
miles
of
it
yet
cornwallis
consumed
seventeen
hours
there
actually
sleeping
on
the
way
before
he
advanced
upon
trenton
which
is
only
twelve
miles
distant
there
is
only
one
way
of
accounting
for
this
cornwallis
must
have
had
positive
orders
and
washington
must
have
known
it
or
becoming
careless
and
desperate
of
the
result
which
is
possible
even
in
washington
he
loitered
upon
the
road
and
the
enemy
taking
it
for
a
stratagem
were
intimidated
into
extreme
precaution
soon
after
this
general
lee
was
captured
and
congress
abandoned
philadelphia
it
was
a
general
not
anticipate
place
yourselves
with
us
in
the
boats
my
children
imagine
that
you
see
archibald
and
myself
holding
our
horses
by
the
head
with
one
foot
upon
the
gunwale
looking
into
the
black
deep
water
the
enemy
just
coming
in
sight
flash
after
flash
shot
after
shot
sent
after
us
with
a
loud
word
or
too
in
laugh
and
scorn
from
the
enemy
and
now
and
then
a
horseman
dashing
at
full
speed
along
the
bank
before
the
torches
it
was
a
magnificent
night
but
very
dark
except
in
a
part
of
the
heavens
which
were
all
on
fire
with
a
storm
just
rising
the
opposite
bank
we
found
in
possession
of
a
small
body
that
had
been
thrown
over
in
advance
but
such
was
our
timidity
for
a
while
that
when
some
fellow
shouted
the
enemy
we
were
all
thrown
into
disorder
for
a
moment
without
reflecting
on
the
impossibility
of
such
a
thing
there
was
a
water
and
foam
of
the
horses
at
windward
as
they
fretted
upon
their
bits
and
shook
their
wet
manes
in
the
wind
blew
in
my
face
and
when
i
landed
wet
through
and
chilled
and
stiffened
in
all
my
limbs
i
can
not
deny
that
somewhat
of
the
generous
enthusiasm
for
liberty
which
i
had
felt
appeared
extinct
within
me
ours
was
the
third
or
fourth
boat
and
i
recognized
washington
immediately
and
he
my
brother
for
he
rode
down
directing
him
to
form
upon
the
right
saying
as
he
did
so
i
have
heard
of
your
good
conduct
young
man
you
have
joined
a
sinking
but
not
a
desperate
cause
and
i
am
sure
that
the
brave
men
with
you
will
live
to
experience
the
effect
of
their
example
remember
me
to
every
individual
at
your
leisure
and
give
me
a
list
of
their
names
where
so
many
are
leaving
me
the
country
ought
to
know
who
are
coming
in
brother
flourishing
his
light
weapon
in
the
wind
as
washington
rode
off
how
a
few
words
from
such
a
man
as
that
can
agitate
a
human
heart
brother
i
am
no
longer
a
boy
no
longer
weak
washington
has
spoken
with
me
face
to
face
and
hereafter
mark
me
i
give
way
to
no
man
upon
this
earth
i
was
carried
away
with
his
enthusiasm
and
now
being
safe
from
pursuit
we
were
thrown
off
into
a
separate
covering
party
while
the
virginians
saluting
us
as
they
passed
with
something
more
than
a
military
feeling
for
had
nt
we
been
in
battle
together
filed
off
in
a
contrary
direction
to
join
their
companions
the
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
clinton
joined
us
still
with
the
air
of
a
superiour
in
command
and
addressing
my
brother
who
was
smoothing
the
mane
of
his
beautiful
mare
said
to
him
the
commander
in
chief
has
confirmed
your
hundred
men
for
a
while
hereafter
they
will
be
reduced
at
present
they
are
too
numerous
for
your
command
you
have
the
liberty
of
naming
your
own
officers
my
men
shall
choose
for
themselves
said
archibald
no
sir
that
will
not
be
permitted
the
service
has
been
too
long
the
sport
of
that
shameful
practice
it
leads
to
indulgence
carelessness
and
neglect
of
duty
whom
would
you
name
arthur
rodman
said
my
brother
bowing
and
jonathan
oadley
and
whom
you
please
for
the
rest
your
recommendation
will
be
attended
to
said
clinton
facing
his
horse
but
i
would
have
you
know
gentlemen
that
the
eye
of
the
general
is
upon
you
he
expects
the
greatest
vigilance
and
severest
discipline
you
are
now
in
service
and
subject
to
martial
law
there
was
something
sarcastick
in
the
tone
with
which
this
was
said
as
if
meant
to
irritate
but
my
brother
took
had
gone
his
manners
mend
apace
brother
but
that
arm
of
his
seems
wonderfully
improved
in
camp
i
had
observed
that
it
was
no
longer
in
the
sling
do
you
know
the
surgeon
that
attends
him
no
i
replied
he
came
very
opportunely
to
the
through
her
redundant
hair
upon
which
her
face
lay
half
buried
and
pronounced
his
name
a
slight
shivering
followed
and
in
a
few
minutes
amid
the
dead
stillness
of
all
about
she
arose
and
sat
up
and
put
her
two
hands
into
his
saying
archibald
i
can
now
die
in
peace
i
have
only
waited
for
you
and
i
lucia
he
replied
kissing
her
forehead
while
the
tears
gushed
thrilled
and
trembled
with
pleasure
i
have
come
to
you
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
to
close
my
eyes
archibald
heaven
bless
you
heaven
bless
you
for
it
o
mother
do
not
break
my
heart
upon
the
spot
why
will
you
sob
and
weep
so
distractedly
is
not
this
what
i
have
always
told
you
always
have
i
not
said
father
mother
sister
brother
there
is
no
hope
god
hath
heard
my
prayer
his
hand
hath
stayed
me
i
do
not
desire
to
live
i
do
not
deserve
it
he
hath
upheld
me
till
now
that
i
might
see
archibald
dear
archibald
once
more
o
archibald
how
i
have
wept
for
you
and
i
said
he
in
a
solemn
sweet
voice
like
one
summoned
by
something
invisible
dreading
it
not
and
ready
to
depart
whenever
it
shall
please
heaven
i
dear
lucia
have
wept
let
us
be
firm
the
little
time
that
is
left
to
us
i
what
is
there
no
hope
none
for
you
archibald
said
the
dying
girl
kissing
his
hands
with
uplifted
eyes
and
watching
the
changes
of
his
face
none
dear
none
the
malady
is
incurable
i
hush
said
mr
arnauld
have
done
with
this
my
children
it
is
impious
vain
and
ungrateful
you
know
not
what
death
is
coming
upon
you
in
stillness
slowly
and
perpetually
do
i
not
said
archibald
calmly
putting
his
hand
through
his
brown
beautiful
hair
and
wringing
out
the
moisture
as
if
it
had
been
the
heavy
march
rain
do
i
not
it
is
not
rain
sir
it
is
the
sweat
of
death
a
night
sweat
that
hath
been
upon
me
for
more
than
a
year
i
hush
in
mercy
hush
cried
i
know
not
what
it
is
yet
it
seems
horrible
i
have
looked
out
in
the
vast
desolate
night
in
search
of
him
i
watched
for
what
i
thought
his
coming
for
with
fear
rose
longing
in
my
heart
to
know
what
t
was
which
shook
us
all
do
you
really
believe
sister
said
clara
really
and
truly
that
there
is
no
hope
she
was
leaning
over
the
chair
of
lucia
about
a
week
after
the
last
conversation
while
i
sat
ruminating
upon
the
awful
events
of
the
past
archibald
passed
the
window
just
as
she
was
going
to
reply
on
horseback
his
motion
was
very
feeble
and
wayward
how
unlike
himself
said
lucia
locking
her
hands
when
he
rode
by
that
window
before
he
was
younger
by
many
years
in
reality
he
appeared
ha
how
much
younger
but
sorrow
will
have
way
and
where
hath
she
wrought
so
unsparingly
as
upon
you
do
not
believe
the
physician
do
not
he
may
be
an
honest
man
a
skilful
one
but
i
know
better
than
he
what
that
malady
is
whose
approach
is
felt
by
the
sufferer
and
known
to
be
death
i
know
clara
that
there
is
no
help
for
me
i
would
have
you
prepared
for
it
i
die
of
a
broken
heart
i
do
not
complain
i
can
not
many
weeks
many
weeks
may
pass
away
before
you
are
called
upon
to
scatter
the
white
flowers
over
my
grave
white
flowers
no
let
none
be
scattered
there
i
see
him
see
him
two
years
ago
he
would
have
reined
an
unbroken
colt
as
easy
as
i
could
direct
the
motion
of
that
child
s
arm
kissing
the
little
fat
arm
of
james
while
she
spoke
yet
now
the
unmanageable
creature
bears
him
whither
he
will
and
how
poor
archibald
brother
brother
i
saw
the
movement
of
the
animal
but
it
was
too
late
and
i
was
unable
to
move
hand
or
foot
in
my
terrour
till
i
saw
archibald
by
a
sudden
effort
which
amazed
me
rise
in
the
stirrups
and
throw
himself
off
as
the
furious
horse
ran
snorting
and
plunging
toward
that
identical
tree
where
archibald
had
been
well
nigh
dashed
to
pieces
years
before
a
servant
passed
the
window
at
full
speed
another
and
another
with
arthur
and
copely
and
we
were
left
in
the
terrible
suspense
that
followed
for
several
minutes
till
we
saw
archibald
returning
on
foot
supported
between
copely
and
a
servant
he
smiled
as
he
passed
her
window
and
stopped
signifying
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
that
he
had
something
to
say
clara
threw
up
the
window
do
not
be
alarmed
said
he
it
was
a
childish
notion
i
was
i
parted
with
him
and
he
threw
me
it
is
a
good
lesson
to
me
are
you
hurt
dear
archibald
not
in
the
least
he
replied
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
not
in
the
least
i
am
to
be
sure
a
little
mortified
but
i
have
been
on
horseback
for
the
last
time
shut
the
window
clara
said
i
feeling
the
tears
upon
my
cheek
it
is
very
cold
and
bleak
abroad
it
is
indeed
said
copely
dashing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
indeed
it
is
indeed
it
is
said
arthur
and
clara
at
the
same
moment
at
this
time
i
was
able
to
move
with
tolerable
comfort
about
the
house
and
after
sitting
where
i
was
for
about
half
an
hour
musing
upon
the
beautiful
face
that
lay
before
me
her
large
waxen
eye
lids
fringed
with
shadow
and
silkiness
black
them
like
some
mysterious
splendour
about
to
break
upon
us
and
blind
us
her
round
and
wonderfully
beautiful
arm
lying
under
her
cheek
her
magnificent
hair
all
loose
upon
the
pillow
and
her
young
bosom
just
undulating
under
the
pressure
of
her
other
hand
as
if
a
hushed
infant
were
there
whom
it
were
death
of
pigtail
aboard
his
mouth
but
in
three
hours
sailing
you
ll
be
overhauled
quarters
then
beat
to
quarters
but
pack
all
sail
put
her
before
the
wind
helm
a
port
steady
there
hold
her
at
that
a
few
gratuitous
curses
by
way
of
emphasis
garnished
the
order
discipline
was
kidd
s
creed
and
he
supposed
it
was
brought
about
only
in
one
method
the
cat
o
nine
tails
had
been
freely
used
that
very
morning
the
yard
arm
was
handy
and
the
plank
lay
in
the
gangway
ready
at
a
word
to
be
run
out
from
the
vessel
s
side
at
every
springing
of
this
dreadful
trap
a
living
corpse
was
heard
to
plunge
and
cries
for
help
to
come
with
the
wind
till
the
speed
of
crew
to
every
various
and
rapid
service
which
is
suddenly
required
in
preparing
for
flight
and
battle
at
the
same
time
different
orders
were
given
in
the
same
breath
which
were
sometimes
misunderstood
and
sometimes
to
his
critical
eye
too
slightly
and
negligently
executed
his
orders
had
at
first
some
few
words
of
intelligible
english
mixed
here
and
there
among
his
oaths
but
he
soon
confined
himself
to
his
vocabulary
of
profanity
which
he
fairly
exhausted
more
than
once
in
french
dutch
and
english
he
soon
saw
that
a
battle
was
inevitable
for
the
quedah
from
a
long
voyage
was
not
in
so
good
sailing
order
as
the
vessel
in
pursuit
which
was
fast
coming
up
i
did
not
care
enough
whether
i
fought
or
run
to
make
up
my
mind
about
it
said
he
to
bolton
as
he
suddenly
assumed
an
air
of
perfect
composure
but
i
think
we
shall
be
saved
the
trouble
of
a
council
of
war
on
that
point
we
must
take
in
had
their
fighting
rations
let
the
quarter
master
bring
some
this
way
that
i
may
have
a
word
over
a
social
glass
with
you
mr
bolton
i
like
this
chance
of
a
battle
if
it
was
only
as
an
apology
for
drinking
though
you
may
say
i
m
not
difficult
about
excuses
but
bolton
to
be
serious
we
must
be
prepared
you
know
for
the
worst
and
be
the
chance
of
our
being
taken
what
it
may
there
shall
be
none
of
our
being
betrayed
a
conversation
succeeded
in
a
tone
low
but
earnest
in
which
nothing
could
be
distinguished
except
at
intervals
such
words
the
prisoner
the
plank
he
knows
all
and
it
ca
nt
be
helped
dead
men
tell
no
tales
c
the
result
was
soon
known
without
ceremony
or
even
a
public
declaration
of
the
design
a
few
men
were
despatched
for
the
unhappy
object
of
kidd
s
suspicions
who
brought
the
victim
upon
deck
struggling
and
reluctant
with
he
was
led
along
the
plank
which
projected
over
the
sides
of
the
gangway
and
which
was
cut
from
its
slight
lashing
so
that
he
dropped
in
the
water
and
was
left
in
the
wake
of
the
vessel
there
was
carelessly
seated
on
the
deck
of
the
martyr
a
young
and
what
ladies
would
call
a
handsome
looking
man
with
a
spy
glass
in
his
hand
which
he
happened
at
this
moment
to
apply
to
his
eye
i
can
not
stop
as
the
manner
of
some
is
to
tell
how
he
looked
how
his
hat
had
fallen
from
his
head
and
left
it
with
no
other
covering
than
thick
dark
curls
of
chesnut
hair
which
the
wind
stirred
from
his
high
fair
forehead
nor
of
the
form
that
graced
the
rude
ground
work
of
the
quater
deck
i
must
be
if
possible
as
rapid
in
my
narration
as
he
was
in
his
action
when
his
accidental
glance
assisted
by
the
spy
glass
rested
on
that
sight
of
horror
which
time
worn
manuscript
must
pardon
me
if
i
leave
them
to
conjecture
how
he
looked
when
he
sprang
on
his
feet
and
with
a
freedom
of
language
which
in
those
pure
days
even
the
profession
of
a
seaman
did
not
allow
exclaimed
good
god
they
ve
murdered
a
man
away
there
to
his
help
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
boatswain
was
heard
above
the
busy
hum
of
the
ship
s
crew
away
there
you
first
cutters
away
and
the
hint
was
taken
by
the
boat
s
crew
who
headed
by
an
officer
were
over
the
vessel
s
side
and
seated
at
their
own
oars
with
the
activity
of
a
flock
of
mother
cary
s
chickens
the
speed
of
manual
exertion
is
no
where
shown
to
more
advantage
than
on
board
a
vessel
of
war
pull
pull
said
the
officer
as
he
stood
in
the
stern
with
the
tiller
in
his
hand
a
shot
from
the
quedah
went
so
near
his
head
was
a
flaw
in
the
bullet
ah
we
shall
engage
in
a
minute
pull
pull
away
the
men
sprang
to
their
oars
for
the
floating
victim
the
long
ridges
of
the
ocean
wave
were
dashing
over
him
and
in
his
drowning
ears
deep
answered
unto
deep
he
had
pulled
the
baudage
from
his
eyes
and
it
now
hung
loose
about
his
neck
so
that
he
saw
the
effort
for
his
relief
and
was
struggling
with
the
exertion
of
a
spent
swimmer
to
whom
hope
had
given
preternatural
power
when
the
barge
was
sweeping
by
him
and
the
man
in
the
bow
caught
the
handkerchief
round
his
neck
with
a
boat
hook
the
oars
stopped
and
the
boat
with
the
body
along
side
drove
through
the
water
with
the
headway
already
acquired
the
man
was
exhausted
and
lifeless
to
all
appearance
when
they
took
him
on
board
and
put
about
for
the
ship
by
this
time
the
vessels
were
so
near
that
some
shots
had
already
is
said
that
the
silent
moment
before
the
grim
ridges
of
war
join
in
the
conflict
is
dreadful
and
occasion
has
been
taken
by
the
great
captains
of
antiquity
to
address
their
armies
in
speeches
on
the
rough
edge
of
battle
ere
it
joined
and
this
practice
as

in
their
own
unadorned
and
homely
style
and
direct
our
attention
to
edward
barrymore
who
was
as
deeply
enamoured
as
either
of
them
and
at
that
very
moment
anxiously
pining
for
an
opportunity
to
pledge
his
vows
to
the
mistress
of
his
affections
but
in
order
to
proceed
with
his
affairs

thaunus
the
druid
the
reader
will
remember
that
we
left
edward
and
the
recluse
together
in
the
cavern
the
old
man
reluctant
as
he
was
to
part
with
our
hero
acknowledged
the
necessity
of
his
speedily
withdrawing
from
that
part
of
the
country
since
he
had
however
innocently
and
unintentionally
became
an
object
of
suspicion
to
some
of
the
united
irishmen
the
virtuous
and
more
influential
of
them
said
he
i
know
will
oppose
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
any
attempt
to
injure
you
and
will
no
doubt
succeed
in
frustrating
any
such
attempt
if
they
only
obtain
timely
information
of
its
being
intended
but
the
framers
of
this
confederacy
have
not
been
choice
in
selecting
its
members
and
the
more
wicked
and
abandoned
of
the
wiser
and
more
virtuous
when
they
do
not
happen
to
correspond
with
their
own
passions
and
prejudices
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
expected
that
the
injunctions
of
o
halloran
or
any
other
of
their
leaders
will
have
much
influence
in
restraining
the
violence
of
such
men
as
darragh
and
his
companion
who
would
set
the
orders
of
their
supreme
directory
itself
if
they
interfered
with
their
views
at
defiance
my
friend
replied
edward
your
good
sense
and
the
interest
you
have
evinced
in
my
welfare
deserve
my
confidence
i
will
therefore
entrust
the
dearest
wishes
of
my
soul
to
your
keeping
it
is
now
become
necessary
that
i
should
leave
this
part
of
the
country
not
only
my
own
safety
but
perhaps
the
safety
of
one
dearer
to
me
than
myself
demands
it
for
if
i
should
fall
who
would
then
with
the
same
solicitude
watch
over
her
and
defend
her
from
danger
ah
sir
that
i
feel
as
if
one
of
the
strings
of
my
heart
were
breaking
when
i
think
of
leaving
the
part
of
the
country
where
she
resides
and
in
times
too
like
these
when
evils
threaten
her
from
every
quarter
should
misfortune
overtake
her
in
my
absence
my
only
consolation
will
be
a
reliance
on
your
prudence
and
friendship
to
afford
her
protection
until
i
can
fly
to
her
aid
promise
me
that
you
will
give
me
frequent
and
speedy
information
of
whatever
may
befal
her
and
that
when
the
storm
bursts
you
will
if
in
your
power
in
this
sacred
asylum
afford
her
shelter
from
its
fury
promise
me
this
and
the
weight
of
anxiety
that
now
oppresses
me
shall
be
greatly
relieved
i
not
only
promise
you
this
said
the
recluse
but
whatever
else
may
be
in
my
power
to
do
for
the
safety
and
welfare
of
ellen
hamilton
will
you
consent
to
be
the
medium
of
any
communications
i
may
will
replied
the
recluse
without
hesitation
unless
she
forbids
it
but
hasten
from
this
dangerous
neighbourhood
for
here
there
are
active
and
malignant
spirits
aroused
against
you
for
your
destruction
farewell
and
may
the
almighty
god
of
all
things
protect
and
bless
you
farewell
father
said
edward
and
he
hastened
to
apprise
o
halloran
of
his
intended
departure
and
to
seek
a
farewell
interview
with
ellen
the
early
part
of
the
morning
had
been
somewhat
cloudy
and
one
of
those
gentle
rains
known
among
the
northern
irish
by
the
name
of
may
showers
had
fallen
and
rendered
the
atmosphere
moist
but
not
cold
the
day
however
assumed
a
brighter
aspect
and
the
advancing
sun
had
dried
away
all
the
lucid
pearls
that
had
lately
bespangled
the
tender
springing
grass
the
lovely
richness
of
whose
verdure
has
procured
for
ireland
the
appropriate
epithet
of
the
emerald
isle
with
this
refreshing
verdure
were
intermixed
innumerable
multitudes
of
those
simple
flowers
so
sweetly
described
pale
and
violet
blue
lay
scattered
o
er
the
fields
the
daisy
pied
and
all
the
sweets
the
dawn
of
nature
yields
such
fragrance
in
the
bosom
lies
of
her
whom
i
adore
ah
gramachree
c
invited
by
affairs
if
you
preserve
that
woe
begone
visage
indeed
any
other
safeguard
against
the
effect
of
your
charms
will
be
quite
superfluous
come
my
love
cheer
up
and
let
me
hear
your
sweet
voice
at
my
dinner
table
as
sweet
to
me
as
minstrelsy
to
an
old
chieftain
ellen
made
a
vain
effort
to
recover
her
spirits
and
then
hurried
away
that
she
might
indulge
her
ingenuous
sorrow
without
giving
pain
to
her
friend
she
was
careful
to
follow
mrs
harrison
s
prudent
counsel
and
when
george
lenox
came
to
friendly
farewell
message
with
the
information
that
her
duty
to
mrs
allen
precluded
her
seeing
him
again
before
the
morning
dawned
george
was
in
a
stage
coach
on
his
way
to
the
south
he
passed
the
boundary
of
lansdown
with
almost
as
heavy
a
heart
as
our
first
parent
bore
through
the
gates
of
paradise
feeling
like
all
true
lovers
that
the
world
is
divided
into
two
parts
that
where
she
is
and
that
where
she
is
not
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
mrs
harrison
was
most
gratified
or
disappointed
by
the
result
of
her
investigation
into
the
state
of
ellen
s
affections
while
she
lived
her
annuity
was
ample
for
the
support
of
ellen
and
herself
but
nothing
could
be
more
precarious
than
such
a
dependence
and
ellen
might
be
left
to
encounter
alone
the
wants
of
life
young
lenox
had
promising
talents
and
those
getting
along
faculties
that
are
a
warrant
for
success
his
devoted
attachment
was
merit
in
the
eyes
of
mrs
harrison
still
he
wanted
result
of
cultivation
and
those
graces
of
manner
to
all
which
mrs
harrison
from
her
early
habits
and
associations
gave
it
may
be
an
undue
importance
there
is
such
a
taste
for
learning
we
use
the
word
in
its
provincial
sense
pervading
all
ranks
in
new
england
if
indeed
ranks
can
be
predicated
of
a
society
where
none
dare
to
define
the
dividing
lines
and
few
can
perceive
them
that
we
often
see
those
advanced
to
the
most
conspicuous
stations
in
society
whose
boyish
years
have
been
spent
in
ploughing
the
narrow
fields
of
the
patrimonial
farm
there
are
some
disagreeable
results
from
this
state
of
things
on
the
whole
so
honourable
and
mrs
harrison
felt
that
in
implanting
in
ellen
the
tastes
that
belonged
to
the
highest
grades
of
society
and
in
cultivating
the
habits
of
the
born
lady
she
had
conferred
a
superiority
of
doubtful
value
and
she
was
almost
led
to
regret
the
fastidiousness
which
had
been
her
own
work
when
she
felt
herself
compelled
to
trace
who
was
her
equal
in
all
important
respects
and
whose
excellent
character
and
flattering
prospects
would
have
rendered
a
connexion
with
him
highly
advantageous
we
said
mrs
harrison
almost
regretted
the
state
of
ellen
s
heart
we
fear
she
did
not
quite
for
in
common
with
the
best
individuals
she
sometimes
sacrificed
general
and
immutable
principles
to
the
indulgence
of
her
favourite
peculiarities
mrs
allen
s
life
closed
at
the
end
of
a
few
painful
weeks
and
ellen
after
having
performed
every
service
for
her
with
the
strictest
fidelity
wept
over
her
with
filial
sorrow
old
mrs
allen
soon
after
joined
her
grandson
at
eton
and
ellen
thus
unfettered
by
duty
returned
to
mrs
harrison
s
where
her
life
passed
happily
in
pursuits
congenial
to
her
taste
till
she
was
summoned
to
vermont
by
intelligence
of
the
threatening
illness
of
edward
allen
chapter
ix
see
what
a
ready
tongue
suspicion
hath
henry
ivth
our
readers
no
doubt
will
think
it
is
quite
time
that
we
should
return
from
our
long
digression
their
notice
till
one
evening
mrs
lenox
entering
miss
bruce
s
apartment
said
ellen
are
you
here
and
quite
alone
quite
alone
replied
ellen
miss
redwood
has
not
left
her
father
s
room
since
they
took
their
tea
i
am
glad
of
it
glad
the
girl
has
the
grace
to
stay
with
him
even
for
half
an
hour
though
her
society
seems
to
be
of
little
use
or
consolation
and
particularly
glad
dear
ellen
to
find
you
alone
i
must
interrupt
your
starlight
meditations
or
rather
give
you
an
interesting
subject
for
them
but
we
shall
want
a
light
for
i
have
brought
you
a
letter
to
read
a
letter
yes
my
dear
a
letter
and
to
me
the
most
delightful
i
ever
received
she
was
about
to
proceed
to
divulge
its
contents
when
both
she
and
ellen
were
startled
by
a
sound
about
miss
redwood
s
bed
mrs
lenox
advanced
to
the
bed
no
one
here
she
said
i
fancied
i
heard
a
sound
i
fancied
so
too
said
ellen
happily
we
were
both
mistaken
my
dear
for
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
tell
my
story
to
any
ears
but
yours
ellen
i
am
the
proudest
and
happiest
of
mothers
i
have
just
received
a
letter
from
george
which
proves
that
he
is
worthy
of
his
prosperity
i
am
very
glad
of
it
and
do
you
not
yet
ellen
suspect
the
reason
you
have
to
be
glad
do
you
not
know
that
george
loves
you
oh
i
hope
not
exclaimed
ellen
involuntarily
hope
not
my
dear
ellen
i
am
sure
there
is
not
another
in
the
world
so
worthy
of
his
love
not
another
who
would
be
such
an
ornament
to
the
station
in
which
george
will
place
his
wife
not
another
that
i
should
be
so
happy
to
call
my
child
ellen
said
nothing
do
not
mrs
lenox
continued
repress
your
feelings
george
like
a
dutiful
son
has
made
me
his
confidante
and
why
should
not
you
george
himself
can
hardly
love
you
better
than
i
do
thank
you
thank
you
mrs
lenox
no
my
dear
you
must
not
thank
me
you
are
worthy
your
good
fortune
and
your
own
merit
has
secured
it
i
have
used
no
influence
though
i
would
have
done
any
thing
to
have
brought
about
the
connection
but
this
is
george
s
unbiassed
decision
he
confesses
to
me
he
has
