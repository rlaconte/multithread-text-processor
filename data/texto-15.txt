eyes
which
in
daylight
appeared
deep
blue
were
hooded
with
a
film
of
white
mount
s
question
was
in
order
he
was
asking
for
information
but
there
was
some
slight
at
stake
drinking
the
water
somebody
else
hauled
did
nt
have
the
right
to
come
by
information
so
easy
or
to
care
so
little
which
way
the
answer
went
do
nt
he
know
he
s
asking
us
about
how
we
plan
to
live
and
die
do
nt
he
know
that
when
he
says
reasonable
that
way
he
s
like
a
man
watching
a
fight
and
egging
the
fighters
on
shel
ha
no
idea
what
was
in
his
own
face
but
some
of
his
thoughts
must
have
shown
for
tom
mount
s
face
pinked
up
a
little
and
his
eyes
shel
s
finally
unveiled
while
shel
was
unraveling
his
own
thoughts
about
tom
moun
lute
cope
gave
mount
his
answer
you
got
any
better
plan
tom
how
about
fighting
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
lute
cope
was
the
man
in
shel
s
opinion
who
ought
to
head
it
up
he
was
the
right
age
shel
supposed
him
to
be
ten
years
his
senior
he
was
better
educated
him
the
ins
and
outs
of
people
and
he
had
his
own
land
which
meant
he
had
his
own
money
and
his
own
future
to
think
about
too
shel
did
nt
intend
to
take
a
back
seat
unless
he
saw
a
man
clearly
marked
to
be
up
front
he
thought
cope
was
that
man
and
he
was
ready
to
enlist
under
him
there
were
other
men
on
the
tract
he
admired
raunce
was
a
hard
worker
but
crazy
as
a
grasshopper
and
spitting
bible
texts
like
tobaccojuice
asa
brice
was
in
some
ways
another
oddity
though
what
was
odd
about
minding
your
own
business
growing
sweet
potatoes
instead
of
oranges
and
watching
birds
instead
of
courting
girls
he
could
nt
say
it
was
this
last
that
made
him
wonder
any
man
past
twenty
not
married
or
trying
to
marry
struck
him
as
a
halfway
suicide
that
man
either
had
been
scamped
in
his
make
up
or
he
lacked
imagination
either
way
shel
did
nt
fathom
him
he
wondered
some
about
tom
mount
anyway
he
did
nt
strike
him
as
a
bachelor
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
took
wendlin
jessup
to
be
the
tract
s
leading
citizen
but
wendlin
was
too
calm
and
easygoing
he
d
make
a
joke
of
anything
if
you
had
to
lose
be
on
wendlin
s
side
he
d
teach
you
how
to
smile
while
eating
crow
i
do
nt
plan
on
needing
that
knowledge
shel
thought
base
cudlip
on
the
other
hand
did
nt
have
a
calm
easygoing
bone
in
his
body
shel
looked
across
the
tent
to
where
base
sat
reared
up
amidst
his
younguns
like
a
crested
cock
the
man
had
rubbed
him
the
wrong
way
they
were
from
the
same
state
and
shel
worked
against
his
instincts
to
give
the
man
his
due
what
s
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
himself
you
want
to
be
the
only
kaintuck
crowing
on
the
dung
heap
ben
jessup
was
maybe
the
best
man
he
d
ever
known
shel
had
a
lot
of
respect
for
goodness
himself
on
jesus
christ
which
might
fit
him
for
the
pulpit
but
not
for
leading
a
fight
for
water
his
model
being
one
who
had
turned
water
into
wine
might
give
ben
the
idea
a
miracle
would
serve
here
shel
did
nt
think
they
could
afford
to
bank
on
it
no
lute
cope
was
the
man
and
shel
having
elected
him
was
on
the
point
of
giving
him
the
news
and
giving
him
his
hand
too
saying
captain
i
m
lieutenant
shelby
lewis
reporting
for
duty
in
his
own
struggle
toward
self
reliance
shel
could
still
use
a
model
he
had
a
bump
of
veneration
on
his
skull
he
had
a
yearning
for
nobility
he
could
accept
he
d
had
to
the
meanness
and
nastiness
of
the
human
race
but
by
god
what
he
hankered
for
was
a
man
who
could
rise
up
steadfast
in
the
face
of
it
and
conquer
it
he
was
still
hurt
admit
it
or
not
by
that
old
he
was
still
hunting
examples
to
refute
him
men
whose
lives
would
say
to
him
shel
you
do
nt
have
to
be
a
man
like
your
pappy
shel
made
a
halfway
motion
of
his
hand
to
touch
lute
get
his
attention
and
say
plainly
what
was
on
his
mind
i
m
behind
you
lute
i
m
backing
you
up
you
can
depend
on
me
but
by
the
time
he
d
steeled
himself
to
be
so
outspoken
lute
was
busy
with
two
ladies
who
were
asking
him
if
the
seats
on
the
other
side
of
tom
mount
were
being
saved
shel
looked
up
into
the
faces
of
eunice
fry
and
opal
tetford
i
was
saving
them
for
press
and
hannah
lute
reluctant
to
seem
discourteous
said
hesitantly
opal
was
equally
reluctant
to
have
lute
blaming
himself
there
s
lots
of
other
seats
lute
do
nt
you
worry
the
meeting
had
obviously
excited
these
ladies
the
chance
for
a
little
party
had
gone
to
was
not
much
more
noticeable
than
a
tree
or
an
outcropping
of
stone
was
all
ablaze
a
tree
on
fire
or
an
outcropping
blasted
open
to
show
a
vein
of
gold
shel
stared
at
her
forgetting
to
introduce
his
family
he
was
abashed
before
so
open
a
display
of
feeling
he
felt
he
should
warn
her
that
the
occasion
was
not
up
to
it
that
starting
out
at
this
pitch
she
was
in
for
a
disappointment
she
had
her
excuses
he
knew
those
two
ladies
had
been
living
a
hard
lonely
life
doing
a
man
s
work
in
getting
their
land
cleared
and
their
house
raised
still
this
was
a
meeting
for
water
it
was
nt
christmas
as
inexplicable
as
it
was
profoundly
moving
cliff
had
not
been
tidy
she
might
have
written
down
in
the
record
book
but
her
hand
had
not
even
moved
in
the
direction
of
the
pen
he
was
accustomed
to
leave
things
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
had
no
fixed
place
for
any
of
his
belongings
and
therefore
never
remembered
where
anything
was
often
he
would
put
a
soiled
shirt
or
pair
of
them
or
find
them
for
six
weeks
or
half
a
year
later
more
often
than
not
he
lost
his
cufflinks
and
never
found
them
again
so
that
in
her
absence
he
or
boyd
would
be
compelled
to
sew
buttons
on
the
impractical
french
cuffs
he
had
lost
two
wrist
watches
and
since
he
always
lost
gloves
he
gave
up
wearing
them
alma
often
wondered
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
army
where
he
perforce
must
have
had
to
be
neat
orderly
prompt
and
in
line
perhaps
cliff
had
learned
to
be
all
these
things
in
the
army
alma
decided
boyd
had
hinted
as
much
and
then
they
had
been
informed
he
had
been
awarded
the
purple
heart
a
phrase
that
froze
her
with
nausea
and
again
alma
caught
herself
thinking
about
her
nephew
in
the
present
in
what
she
had
once
seen
described
somewhere
as
the
specious
present
she
felt
often
confusing
time
that
cliff
was
both
at
home
with
her
and
in
the
army
she
and
sit
down
to
supper
with
her
and
boyd
and
the
next
moment
she
was
waiting
to
receive
a
letter
from
his
apo
address
the
clock
in
the
east
room
chimed
how
odd
how
terrifying
and
yet
how
soothing
she
thought
putting
down
the
record
book
that
time
runs
out
first
we
are
here
she
said
to
herself
being
this
sort
of
person
and
then
so
little
later
we
have
lost
all
track
of
that
time
and
who
we
were
then
until
some
trifle
brings
us
back
to
that
period
for
a
brief
lightning
illumined
second
then
back
again
to
the
now
daily
scandal
sheet
boyd
greeted
her
with
his
customary
early
evening
remark
putting
down
the
sentinel
in
alma
s
lap
sometimes
she
responded
to
this
hackneyed
greeting
in
a
feminine
pleased
way
again
in
a
crabbed
half
audible
grunt
today
this
late
afternoon
half
dozing
in
her
confused
memories
of
time
and
the
nephew
she
merely
moistened
her
lips
saying
nothing
everything
all
right
boyd
asked
faintly
she
replied
in
her
scolding
voice
then
she
stopped
to
discover
if
she
did
need
anything
indeed
i
ll
go
up
the
street
for
them
in
just
a
minute
he
made
use
of
her
indecision
we
need
cooking
oil
i
am
almost
sure
she
began
to
enumerate
some
cheese
to
go
with
the
pie
that
is
if
you
d
like
pie
he
had
gone
to
the
door
that
led
off
the
sitting
room
while
she
was
making
her
list
opened
it
and
vanished
from
behind
the
door
she
could
hear
him
urinating
tonight
she
did
not
even
resent
the
sound
which
often
made
her
irritable
during
the
entire
supper
hour
the
falling
spray
of
his
water
suddenly
meant
nothing
to
her
ile
came
out
with
his
right
hand
still
touching
his
fly
shall
i
write
down
the
list
of
things
she
made
her
same
daily
query
to
him
and
her
hands
clasped
one
another
i
got
it
all
hand
touched
his
hat
which
he
had
just
put
on
you
might
bring
back
some
whipping
cream
she
said
as
a
last
minute
addition
is
that
the
works
then
she
nodded
when
he
had
finally
gone
she
suddenly
remembered
she
had
not
heard
him
flush
the
toilet
studying
for
a
moment
the
tiny
door
leading
off
the
sitting
room
she
walked
slowly
over
to
it
opened
it
and
went
into
the
closet
looked
down
into
the
bowl
and
flushed
quickly
she
decided
to
wash
her
hands
in
the
kitchen
where
there
was
a
fresh
cake
of
verbena
soap
she
washed
her
hands
slowly
and
deliberately
like
a
surgeon
allowing
a
thick
suds
to
reach
as
far
as
her
wrists
rinsing
them
she
dried
them
on
a
tiny
face
towel
embroidered
with
violets
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
often
in
the
evening
they
made
a
practise
of
turning
out
all
the
lights
and
sitting
in
the
dark
talking
those
who
passed
by
outside
might
watching
television
how
ever
they
had
no
set
neither
boyd
nor
alma
having
the
least
desire
to
have
to
watch
as
well
as
to
hear
something
which
probably
in
the
end
could
concern
them
very
little
once
they
were
seated
in
the
dark
the
emptiness
and
timelessness
of
the
present
receded
a
little
in
this
special
prepared
dark
their
ages
became
ambiguous
and
they
might
therefore
have
belonged
again
to
any
vigorous
decade
of
their
lives
as
they
talked
to
one
another
in
the
dark
it
even
seemed
to
them
that
they
were
living
their
entire
lives
all
at
once
and
were
in
command
of
their
total
personalities
friends
and
relatives
long
dead
entered
into
their
conversation
and
the
hard
implacable
void
of
contemporaneity
was
dissipated
one
could
so
to
speak
see
land
breathe
air
the
night
had
lifted
from
night
the
sound
of
the
blue
jays
piercing
cry
always
meant
that
morning
was
far
advanced
in
a
half
hour
or
so
after
the
jays
cried
one
would
hear
the
how
cliff
had
sometimes
come
in
from
his
work
on
the
yard
or
some
other
household
chore
for
a
bite
to
eat
and
the
jays
had
called
sharply
each
time
he
came
into
the
house
closing
the
screen
door
behind
him
cliff
would
you
enjoy
a
dish
of
fresh
strawberries
she
could
hear
her
own
voice
coming
to
her
out
of
the
recesses
of
the
years
coming
back
to
the
present
she
stood
over
the
kitchen
table
looking
down
at
the
recipe
for
parker
house
rolls
for
she
had
decided
to
present
a
baker
s
dozen
of
these
as
a
slopes
they
would
have
ridden
in
discomfort
the
marks
at
the
entrance
of
the
valley
had
gone
in
only
one
direction
they
had
not
come
out
therefore
he
said
the
squad
should
continue
the
march
up
the
defile
matthew
gave
the
command
accordingly
joe
dummy
turned
his
mouth
down
in
a
sour
expression
it
concealed
his
satisfaction
that
his
young
commander
reposed
trust
in
his
judgment
in
the
care
of
their
study
of
the
trail
the
column
had
taken
almost
three
hours
to
o
clock
in
the
morning
a
late
august
day
and
the
light
was
turning
from
golden
to
white
as
the
day
advanced
the
heat
was
already
wavering
off
the
desert
crust
in
visible
reflections
and
dust
was
hanging
forward
on
the
drying
wind
out
of
mexico
many
miles
away
the
defile
was
pale
in
color
dust
lay
on
the
rocks
that
jutted
from
the
low
slopes
until
from
some
distance
the
rocks
looked
like
rags
of
cloth
or
paper
in
the
beating
light
and
the
grass
made
a
ragged
shimmer
grass
crushed
by
hoofs
gave
up
a
wry
piercing
odor
ahead
of
them
the
hills
time
after
time
folded
away
any
distant
view
but
revealed
with
every
turn
of
a
fold
another
stretch
of
the
low
valley
that
showed
nothing
new
dusty
rocks
in
random
attitudes
the
only
surfaces
to
catch
the
light
and
make
pale
interruptions
of
the
dusty
olive
green
of
the
sharp
grassed
slopes
there
said
joe
riding
beside
matthew
with
a
movement
of
his
crabbed
arm
where
joe
took
the
light
like
the
outcropping
rocks
of
the
whole
passage
and
yet
somehow
did
not
look
quite
the
same
matthew
leaned
sharply
forward
and
halted
the
column
with
a
hand
signal
various
pale
objects
about
sixty
five
yards
ahead
nothing
in
his
experience
prepared
him
to
know
what
they
might
be
even
remembering
all
the
possibilities
which
had
brought
him
here
but
if
lieutenant
hazard
had
never
seen
dead
naked
and
hacked
bodies
lying
to
catch
the
sunlight
under
a
dusty
white
sky
in
a
desert
defile
joe
dummy
had
and
often
he
knew
what
he
saw
the
lieutenant
knew
too
soon
enough
so
did
his
men
the
column
approached
at
a
walk
the
works
left
by
murderers
no
soldier
said
anything
except
a
young
pennsylvanian
and
he
said
with
sudden
vomit
what
his
mouth
could
not
frame
in
words
matthew
glanced
at
him
and
said
cranshaw
dismount
here
and
wait
for
us
the
trooper
shaking
in
his
pallor
nodded
and
came
to
a
halt
they
with
his
horse
s
bridle
caught
around
his
right
ankle
it
was
most
curious
thought
matthew
even
as
he
drew
ahead
with
his
attention
fixed
on
what
they
had
come
to
find
most
curious
how
unsafe
it
was
to
predict
what
any
given
man
might
do
in
situations
of
unaccustomed
difficulty
cranshaw
was
robust
well
favored
seemingly
confident
he
was
liked
in
the
platoon
he
had
a
stock
of
jokes
and
farces
and
he
gave
freely
of
them
to
entertain
his
fellows
when
offered
alcohol
he
drank
readily
and
was
drunk
sooner
than
anyone
and
then
more
droll
than
ever
he
was
much
applauded
for
his
blithe
obscenities
and
music
hall
turns
matthew
had
already
marked
him
for
possible
promotion
for
he
was
quick
and
clever
at
his
tasks
and
men
learned
from
his
demonstrations
at
these
now
at
the
sight
of
mutilated
death
he
failed
the
rest
showing
them
an
example
of
weakness
matthew
reserved
his
judgment
cranshaw
perhaps
must
simply
get
used
to
what
now
the
other
men
saw
in
immediate
clarity
dismounted
matthew
went
forward
alone
with
joe
dummy
yes
this
was
how
all
was
proper
nothing
had
been
neglected
so
joe
dummy
seemed
to
say
as
he
took
in
the
scene
if
he
held
views
about
the
death
of
sergeant
blickner
who
had
abused
him
he
did
not
reveal
them
matthew
was
more
slow
in
accumulating
all
the
details
the
victims
were
naked
their
limbs
were
severed
from
their
bodies
and
slightly
scattered
the
woman
s
body
showed
a
mortal
mercy
powder
burns
close
on
her
breast
indicated
that
sergeant
blickner
had
shot
her
before
she
could
be
taken
prisoner
his
own
flesh
showed
bullet
wounds
of
farther
origin
and
lance
and
knife
cuts
further
specifications
of
unspeakable
treatment
suffered
by
the
two
corpses
would
be
reserved
for
the
official
report
to
the
commanding
officer
of
fort
delivery
matthew
decided
he
was
pale
his
lips
were
white
and
felt
stretched
he
turned
to
his
troopers
and
said
trumpeter
hold
the
horses
the
rest
of
you
men
came
trumpeter
rainey
holding
the
squad
s
bridles
craned
his
neck
a
sense
of
injustice
possessed
him
in
due
time
it
was
relieved
for
the
lieutenant
ordered
the
men
back
and
permitted
him
to
come
forward
in
his
turn
he
was
the
youngest
man
in
the
detachment
matthew
watched
him
study
the
recognizable
pieces
on
the
ground
the
trumpeter
closed
his
jaws
and
squeezed
down
his
eyes
almost
shut
in
his
hardened
face
he
looked
twice
his
age
for
a
moment
then
he
glanced
at
the
lieutenant
and
nodded
and
the
effect
was
of
his
saying
that
it
was
the
worst
thing
you
ever
could
see
but
if
you
had
seen
and
felt
anything
of
life
before
this
was
something
you
just
had
to
put
along
with
all
the
rest
of
it
good
and
bad
to
keep
on
going
yourself
rainey
said
matthew
go
back
and
bring
cranshaw
up
here
if
he
wants
to
see
before
we
decide
what
to
do
next
look
s
sir
said
rainey
saluting
as
he
went
he
was
more
of
a
stylist
at
soldiering
than
the
rest
matthew
moved
aside
with
joe
dummy
how
were
they
how
many
and
where
have
they
gone
he
asked
so
this
and
this
they
were
about
four
in
number
and
they
were
mounted
they
now
had
two
extra
horses
along
with
whatever
arms
and
ammunition
the
sergeant
had
carried
and
all
equipment
including
saddles
and
food
and
he
took
the
steps
three
at
a
time
he
scrambled
up
the
stairway
faster
than
the
elevator
could
have
made
it
even
if
its
operator
had
not
been
under
instructions
as
hugh
was
convinced
he
was
to
have
a
breakdown
somewhere
en
route
at
the
landing
of
his
floor
hugh
took
out
his
and
skidded
around
a
corner
stopped
in
his
tracks
his
gun
was
held
waist
high
and
pointed
at
the
round
belly
of
chu
hoong
creator
of
dragon
s
tooth
elixir
multimillionaire
and
it
just
so
happened
owner
of
the
imperial
hotel
in
bangkok
where
his
orders
could
move
any
and
all
members
of
the
hotel
staff
the
chinese
looked
at
north
impassively
glanced
down
at
the
snub
nosed
revolver
with
the
same
bland
unconcern
the
almond
eyes
returned
to
hugh
s
and
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
the
small
mouth
over
the
goatee
am
ito
understand
that
this
is
a
robbery
mr
boyden
chu
asked
gently
no
up
my
invitations
with
something
solid
to
show
my
sincerity
i
m
inviting
you
now
to
visit
mr
barrows
room
with
me
chu
s
smile
widened
that
would
be
delightful
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
ve
just
come
from
there
i
had
an
idea
you
had
north
grunted
i
trust
you
left
him
in
good
health
the
chinese
turned
shrugging
i
presume
he
was
in
good
health
at
least
he
was
in
good
voice
he
seemed
disturbed
but
of
course
it
was
hard
to
tell
speaking
to
him
through
the
door
as
i
did
through
the
door
ah
yes
he
is
somewhat
strange
this
mr
barrows
is
he
not
he
may
have
reason
to
be
where
you
re
concerned
mr
chu
the
g
man
said
his
pistol
muzzle
never
wavering
perhaps
what
you
said
to
him
through
the
door
was
upsetting
see
why
it
should
have
been
he
said
smoothly
i
merely
called
to
inquire
if
everything
was
satisfactory
as
i
make
it
a
practice
to
inquire
of
all
the
imperial
s
guests
when
i
am
in
bangkok
he
smiled
over
his
shoulder
at
north
the
personal
touch
you
know
i
got
the
idea
from
reading
about
your
so
successful
american
hotel
operators
i
can
imagine
hugh
north
smiled
back
they
reached
the
door
of
room
and
the
colonel
rapped
i
said
go
away
bracht
s
voice
was
gruff
but
now
it
was
hoarse
strained
go
away
chu
or
whatever
you
call
yourself
by
god
if
you
do
nt
i
ll
i
ll
get
somebody
who
ll
make
you
go
away
sounds
as
if
he
s
ready
to
co
operate
with
me
north
told
himself
for
which
heaven
be
praised
it
s
me
boyden
he
called
aloud
are
you
all
right
bracht
s
voice
sounded
again
relief
dripping
yes
yes
i
m
all
right
i
slammed
the
door
on
him
when
i
saw
who
it
was
that
little
devil
he
ll
stop
at
nothing
he
he
ll
kill
me
before
i
get
to
it
s
all
right
hugh
cut
in
hastily
i
ll
be
with
you
in
a
minute
sit
tight
throughout
this
chu
hoong
had
stood
there
with
a
small
compassionate
smile
on
his
rosebud
mouth
now
he
whispered
i
understand
the
poor
man
is
ill
eh
or
he
drinks
unwisely
and
that
is
why
you
have
to
care
for
him
poor
fellow
north
backed
to
his
door
used
his
key
to
open
it
the
gestured
and
chu
hoong
placidly
walked
into
room
his
eyes
roamed
the
room
and
he
clucked
his
tongue
you
see
why
it
is
wise
for
me
to
personally
check
on
the
comfort
of
my
guests
mr
boyden
faded
they
should
have
been
replaced
one
ca
nt
trust
servants
in
these
days
no
matter
what
one
pays
them
he
walked
to
the
easy
chair
in
the
corner
near
the
window
and
calmly
seated
himself
laced
his
fingers
across
his
watermelon
stomach
and
regarded
hugh
north
half
humorously
if
you
are
that
poor
man
s
keeper
you
deserve
an
explanation
he
said
more
than
that
you
deserve
a
million
apologies
from
this
miserable
bungler
i
did
not
know
mr
barrows
was
ill
they
should
have
told
me
down
at
the
desk
suppose
hugh
suggested
we
speak
cantonese
and
please
go
slowly
i
am
not
very
good
at
it
a
generous
gesture
chu
singsonged
in
cantonese
the
genuine
knight
meets
another
s
embarrassing
inability
to
speak
his
language
correctly
by
changing
to
the
unscholared
one
s
dialect
truly
a
splendid
example
of
manners
i
want
to
speak
cantonese
so
the
one
in
the
next
room
now
chu
hoong
why
do
you
fear
henry
barrows
a
veil
descended
over
chu
s
eyes
a
veil
colonel
north
had
seen
come
down
over
a
thousand
chinese
eyes
and
seldom
had
been
able
to
pierce
it
is
unforgivable
to
contradict
a
guest
but
i
must
chu
said
humbly
i
do
not
fear
mr
barrows
if
it
did
not
sound
like
the
boasting
of
a
worm
i
would
tell
you
that
i
do
not
fear
any
human
i
saw
fear
in
your
eyes
when
you
met
barrows
on
the
air
plane
you
did
honorable
guest
then
if
you
thought
you
did
you
did
for
what
a
man
thinks
he
sees
is
true
in
his
mind
consider
the
man
who
loves
an
ugly
woman
love
makes
him
see
a
beautiful
woman
and
so
she
is
beautiful
and
who
can
say
she
is
not
not
this
insignificant
one
he
unclasped
his
hands
long
enough
to
point
a
sharp
nailed
index
finger
at
his
chest
you
who
will
harm
your
patient
honorable
guest
and
so
to
you
i
am
a
menace
but
try
to
see
me
only
as
an
innkeeper
who
desires
that
his
guests
have
comfort
and
succeeding
in
that
you
will
find
no
demon
only
an
old
and
weary
man
who
is
ashamed
that
his
oversolicitude
disturbed
an
ill
person
he
bowed
his
head
his
face
woebegone
what
can
i
do
to
repair
this
thoughtless
error
he
asked
you
ket
deal
i
m
putting
over
or
what
it
is
and
i
do
nt
want
to
know
i
just
want
the
best
i
can
get
for
the
two
of
them
for
neapolitano
virgilia
and
the
mare
i
guess
i
do
nt
care
if
i
m
breaking
some
kind
of
law
herr
jaeger
i
guess
it
s
come
to
that
he
moved
away
from
the
station
wagon
window
and
he
laid
his
small
gloved
hand
on
jaeger
s
forearm
just
look
inside
there
and
you
ll
see
the
hay
you
can
see
it
ca
nt
you
he
said
he
had
drawn
jaeger
forward
to
look
through
the
glass
at
the
greenish
sprays
that
lay
on
the
station
wagon
boards
it
but
scarcely
enough
for
a
week
s
feed
maybe
you
heard
about
the
horse
fair
they
re
holding
in
kneith
in
september
dardenella
said
almost
laughing
in
his
eagerness
christoph
horn
and
me
we
re
going
down
there
may
be
a
lipizzaner
up
on
the
block
we
got
a
tip
i
do
nt
want
to
say
too
much
but
we
re
going
down
to
have
a
look
that
would
make
three
but
a
horse
like
that
a
lipizzaner
jaeger
said
he
sought
the
right
american
phrase
it
would
cost
you
a
million
yes
a
million
a
cool
million
dardenella
said
and
he
liked
the
sound
of
it
so
much
that
he
stood
there
laughing
looking
up
at
jaeger
from
under
the
tilted
brim
of
the
tan
straw
stetson
his
soft
mouth
warm
and
dark
with
his
secrets
his
teeth
clear
white
as
he
laughed
you
see
how
it
is
do
nt
you
herr
jaeger
hay
only
you
understand
i
would
nt
want
the
colonel
to
know
there
was
no
question
that
it
was
hay
jaeger
had
seen
it
in
the
square
of
light
that
the
kitchen
window
cast
on
the
station
wagon
floor
but
when
dardenella
had
driven
away
there
was
something
else
frau
knau
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
as
they
came
in
bearing
the
tall
brown
commissary
bags
in
her
arms
lifting
them
from
the
table
and
carrying
them
one
by
one
because
of
the
weight
to
the
closet
underneath
the
stairs
guten
abend
herr
jaeger
she
said
her
voice
and
face
entirely
serene
come
help
me
walter
to
clear
all
this
away
there
was
no
sign
of
it
left
by
the
time
the
colonel
s
party
drove
into
the
courtyard
frau
knau
and
walter
had
gone
upstairs
to
bed
half
an
hour
before
the
twin
stream
of
the
headlights
moved
across
the
windows
and
swung
like
the
shafts
of
a
lighthouse
beacon
toward
the
pigsty
jaeger
had
sat
alone
in
the
kitchen
of
the
waiting
silent
house
and
now
he
put
out
the
end
of
his
cigarette
and
stood
up
from
the
table
it
was
not
quite
ten
o
clock
as
the
colonel
and
knau
came
through
the
door
there
s
been
some
trouble
jaeger
the
colonel
said
shortly
can
you
tell
me
where
my
daughter
is
it
might
have
been
something
to
laugh
at
the
fact
that
she
was
gone
again
if
the
look
in
the
colonel
s
face
had
been
different
but
the
flush
of
drink
the
fire
of
energy
were
gone
from
it
and
he
stood
there
haggard
brooding
old
behind
him
knau
closed
the
door
against
the
warmth
and
the
involvement
of
the
outdoor
dark
his
shoulders
wooden
as
he
moved
his
eyes
under
the
black
hat
s
brim
blinking
numbly
in
the
light
she
was
with
lieutenant
stephany
jaeger
began
but
the
colonel
cut
him
short
yes
somewhere
during
that
time
she
gave
lieutenant
stephany
the
slip
he
does
nt
even
know
which
way
she
went
jaeger
watched
a
pulse
beating
in
his
left
jaw
as
the
colonel
felt
in
his
trouser
pocket
and
brought
out
a
handful
of
crumpled
bills
and
coins
you
gave
my
wife
some
german
lessons
i
do
nt
remember
how
many
but
take
what
i
owe
you
out
of
this
i
m
wiping
all
my
blackboards
clean
when
he
threw
the
money
down
on
the
table
two
or
three
coins
rolled
over
the
edge
and
across
the
floor
take
out
for
the
interpreting
too
he
said
but
nobody
moved
nobody
spoke
knau
dared
not
cast
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
coins
on
the
floor
sensing
it
may
have
been
the
presence
of
something
more
final
than
money
in
the
kitchen
with
them
now
i
ll
go
upstairs
and
ask
the
wife
he
said
when
he
moved
the
colonel
did
likewise
mounting
vaguely
almost
willessly
where
the
forester
led
perhaps
for
no
better
reason
than
because
he
did
not
know
where
else
to
go
and
jaeger
not
having
relinquished
yet
the
interpreter
s
role
followed
after
them
the
upper
hall
was
lit
by
one
banging
unshaded
bulb
and
they
passed
under
it
in
single
file
jaeger
stooping
a
little
so
that
he
would
not
strike
it
with
his
head
knau
his
back
and
shoulders
rigid
turned
the
knob
of
the
first
door
even
when
he
entered
the
bedroom
the
colonel
followed
him
doggedly
blindly
his
mind
and
anger
somewhere
else
his
step
that
of
an
older
broken
man
jaeger
paused
only
an
instant
on
the
threshold
and
then
he
followed
behind
the
colonel
into
the
room
knau
had
switched
on
a
light
on
the
dresser
and
along
the
east
wall
the
beds
could
be
seen
now
four
of
them
to
judge
from
the
wooden
headboards
but
the
four
of
them
pushed
together
to
form
pure
white
featherbeds
ballooned
in
the
half
obscurity
and
long
white
bolsters
propped
the
sleeping
heads
frau
knau
s
was
first
she
lay
a
little
in
from
the
edge
leaving
space
it
might
be
for
knau
to
lie
beside
her
when
his
labors
would
be
done
he
would
take
off
his
boots
and
lay
aside
his
ceremonious
black
slip
the
suspenders
free
from
his
shoulders
lay
his
pants
across
a
chair
and
with
no
more
than
this
as
preparation
for
the
night
he
the
lecco
factory
made
she
was
astonished
when
he
explained
that
it
produced
most
of
the
steel
wire
used
in
italy
for
making
the
spokes
of
bicycle
and
motorcycle
wheels
it
also
made
most
of
the
metal
stripping
used
for
umbrella
ribs
asked
about
the
relative
quantities
of
these
products
she
was
open
mouthed
at
his
replies
they
might
not
seem
large
in
the
united
states
she
said
but
they
were
enormous
here
yes
he
nodded
an
umbrella
was
a
joke
in
a
sense
but
italian
umbrellas
in
recent
years
had
become
a
large
export
like
thousands
of
other
small
manufactured
articles
and
the
cycle
industry
was
no
trifle
by
any
measure
much
of
his
wheel
spoke
production
went
up
the
lake
to
mandello
to
the
big
motorcycle
works
which
employed
so
much
of
the
labour
of
the
region
suddenly
he
glanced
at
her
and
said
how
should
you
be
interested
in
such
things
why
do
you
know
enough
to
ask
questions
about
industry
oh
i
do
nt
know
much
she
said
but
i
ve
been
taught
what
one
needs
to
understand
for
what
a
woman
the
constant
images
he
laughed
money
darling
how
can
one
understand
investments
if
one
does
nt
know
anything
he
said
again
shaking
his
head
what
have
you
to
do
with
investments
i
manage
my
own
he
was
incredulous
how
can
you
he
said
almost
jeering
well
i
was
made
to
by
my
grandmother
have
nt
you
ever
heard
that
more
than
half
the
invested
money
in
the
united
states
belongs
to
women
heard
it
he
said
jerking
his
head
but
who
could
believe
it
well
it
s
true
and
my
grandmother
was
the
only
child
of
a
rugged
old
roughneck
who
made
his
money
in
mining
oh
it
s
all
such
ancient
history
carlo
no
go
on
i
m
fascinated
what
kind
of
mining
he
was
no
longer
driving
like
a
racer
copper
lead
silver
various
gambles
in
nevada
and
colorado
he
left
it
all
to
his
daughter
and
she
really
had
a
head
for
business
which
grandmother
then
why
have
you
the
money
what
about
your
father
harriet
sighed
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
knew
no
italian
would
understand
and
would
disapprove
with
his
whole
soul
if
he
could
understand
my
father
she
said
well
my
grandmother
did
nt
think
much
of
him
i
suppose
it
was
her
own
fault
she
brought
him
up
but
the
way
he
turned
out
she
simply
left
him
an
allowance
to
live
on
and
left
her
money
to
me
with
directions
that
i
was
to
be
taught
to
take
care
of
it
carlo
s
face
was
a
study
harriet
was
not
sure
whether
he
was
more
astonished
or
more
affronted
marcia
davenport
i
m
sorry
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
i
know
it
sounds
horrifying
here
but
it
s
not
the
least
peculiar
in
the
united
states
and
where
is
your
father
now
he
lives
in
mexico
i
thought
your
parents
were
in
she
said
resigned
do
nt
make
me
spell
it
all
out
carlo
everybody
s
been
divorced
and
remarried
on
and
off
the
merry
go
round
and
she
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
which
moved
him
sharply
i
loathe
it
poveretta
he
murmured
compared
with
your
lives
here
it
s
a
shambles
but
if
you
were
pina
he
said
with
sudden
pungency
if
you
had
pina
s
life
to
live
you
d
have
divorced
me
long
ago
that
s
what
i
did
she
said
quietly
and
here
i
am
there
pina
is
oh
look
carlo
is
that
bergamo
yes
but
do
nt
look
down
there
to
your
right
that
s
bergamobassa
modern
bergamo
look
up
there
he
pointed
to
the
left
where
the
soft
pinkish
mass
of
an
ancient
town
clung
gently
moulded
to
the
shoulder
of
a
mountain
bergamo
alta
town
is
unspoilt
and
the
modern
one
has
room
to
grow
and
your
factories
here
basta
factories
i
m
hungry
tell
me
what
you
ve
got
here
she
insisted
you
made
me
talk
one
of
his
factories
made
cylindrical
steel
products
he
said
drums
and
tubing
and
such
for
the
chemical
industry
another
made
metallic
parts
for
small
machinery
anything
which
moved
or
turned
or
rolled
electrical
appliances
for
instance
but
an
infinity
of
things
how
many
coffee
grinders
do
you
suppose
are
the
constant
image
manufactured
in
italy
and
we
make
the
ratchet
gears
for
most
of
them
gears
for
any
kind
of
small
machine
and
now
he
said
swinging
the
car
to
the
left
and
starting
up
a
long
climbing
street
keep
quiet
because
i
am
worn
out
with
talking
and
i
want
my
lunch
the
street
rose
towards
the
upper
town
branching
at
its
end
right
and
left
he
followed
the
right
hand
turn
the
gateway
in
the
old
city
wall
to
let
another
car
come
through
harriet
looked
at
the
lion
of
san
marco
on
the
arch
and
asked
whether
bergamo
too
had
been
part
of
the
venetian
republic
for
three
hundred
years
it
was
the
westermost
part
it
was
fortified
then
all
this
was
walled
it
is
fortified
still
she
reflected
in
its
own
beauty
she
had
seen
many
of
the
celebrated
hill
cities
of
italy
and
learnt
their
histories
with
more
than
the
usual
tourist
s
interest
but
this
of
which
she
had
heard
nobody
speak
in
the
same
terms
as
assisi
arezzo
gubbio
todi
orvieto
had
its
own
quality
of
wholly
unexpected
enchantment
perhaps
that
was
lombard
she
wondered
why
looking
at
the
shuttered
houses
squeezing
the
narrow
streets
their
faded
tints
soft
as
cushions
that
one
might
reach
out
and
touch
the
shops
were
closed
the
streets
deserted
the
people
had
eaten
and
were
shut
in
their
houses
resting
carlo
drove
past
the
piazza
where
the
whose
gracefulness
and
intimacy
made
harriet
think
this
looks
like
a
cosy
place
but
she
said
nothing
he
swept
round
back
of
the
piazza
and
stopped
before
a
very
old
house
faded
to
a
creamy
sandy
many
times
i
could
almost
repeat
it
by
rote
fellow
citizens
he
said
clearing
his
throat
his
was
a
good
voice
and
he
knew
how
to
use
it
against
the
hiss
of
the
gas
jets
and
the
rustle
of
people
and
their
breathing
his
words
came
hard
and
sharp
with
great
conviction
i
wish
to
deal
tonight
with
the
sad
and
lamentable
case
of
the
last
voyage
of
sir
john
franklin
and
his
ships
erebus
and
terror
to
they
were
listening
well
i
see
among
you
many
scientific
men
men
who
have
visited
the
arctic
as
i
have
and
explored
there
i
know
they
are
acquainted
with
the
facts
but
for
you
others
whose
support
i
seek
i
will
restate
the
facts
in
may
of
some
eighteen
years
past
sir
john
franklin
set
sail
from
england
on
a
voyage
of
exploration
with
a
total
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
nine
men
aboard
his
two
ships
in
the
latter
part
of
july
of
that
year
the
ships
were
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
lancaster
sound
north
of
baffin
island
at
a
north
latitude
of
almost
degrees
never
more
were
they
seen
by
civilized
man
it
was
a
dramatic
and
impressive
start
he
went
on
telling
about
the
relief
expeditions
that
had
been
organized
to
search
for
the
vanished
ships
sir
james
ross
mcclintock
and
the
rest
and
explained
why
he
thought
they
had
failed
warming
to
his
task
he
demanded
and
party
can
they
be
yet
alive
some
of
them
living
in
hardship
and
peril
in
the
frozen
north
this
was
his
chief
point
of
course
he
went
on
to
tell
them
about
himself
his
studies
his
correspondence
his
obsession
with
the
arctic
and
his
recent
expedition
there
for
the
past
ten
years
i
have
studied
this
riddle
i
have
read
everything
that
has
been
published
on
the
subject
i
have
corresponded
with
lady
franklin
herself
who
is
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
find
the
answer
i
believe
i
am
now
on
the
right
track
now
was
the
time
to
ask
for
funds
to
press
home
on
the
note
of
american
enterprise
and
intelligence
now
taking
over
where
other
nations
had
failed
but
a
disturbance
arose
in
the
audience
a
voice
called
out
a
voice
casual
but
authoritative
mr
hall
it
was
professor
thorne
he
dangled
his
pince
nez
from
its
ribbon
and
it
swung
ominously
in
the
gas
flare
giving
have
been
kind
enough
to
invite
me
to
attend
your
talk
this
evening
i
thank
you
for
this
courtesy
he
smiled
and
looked
down
at
the
swinging
spectacles
but
for
this
courtesy
i
am
bound
to
extend
to
you
a
similar
one
my
opinion
of
your
theories
sir
said
mr
hall
i
am
not
quite
finished
if
you
will
bear
with
me
no
matter
said
thorne
there
is
little
more
to
be
said
anyway
the
whole
subject
has
been
exhausted
someone
tittered
and
the
audience
rustled
in
anticipation
of
a
diversion
thorne
was
well
known
as
an
extemporaneous
speaker
and
a
wit
mr
hall
held
up
his
hand
to
silence
the
growing
buzz
of
comment
only
a
moment
mr
hall
said
thorne
his
voice
rising
you
have
wasted
my
time
sir
and
the
time
of
these
good
people
i
think
this
is
a
calculated
fraud
trading
on
the
good
will
is
no
longer
a
puzzle
and
has
not
been
for
some
years
it
is
well
established
that
all
those
unfortunate
men
have
perished
what
good
will
it
do
to
suggest
further
risk
of
life
and
financial
expense
what
can
be
done
now
that
has
not
already
been
done
by
well
qualified
arctic
experts
mr
hall
became
angry
i
will
tell
you
sir
so
far
what
has
been
deduced
a
meager
theory
from
scant
evidence
so
long
as
there
is
a
possibility
that
one
of
those
unfortunate
men
is
still
alive
why
should
not
attempts
be
made
again
and
again
until
all
the
facts
are
known
are
there
not
esquimaux
now
living
in
those
frozen
lands
why
is
it
not
possible
for
some
of
the
franklin
survivors
to
be
living
there
also
eating
esquimaux
food
the
raw
flesh
of
seal
and
deer
dressed
in
furs
sustaining
life
day
by
day
and
waiting
for
delivery
it
is
hardly
possible
thorne
said
a
white
man
could
not
stomach
is
not
used
to
it
but
i
have
done
it
mr
hall
fairly
roared
the
words
to
one
educated
otherwise
as
we
whites
are
feasting
on
uncooked
meats
is
repulsive
but
i
say
eating
meats
raw
or
cooked
is
entirely
a
matter
of
education
uproar
fed
on
uproar
and
several
troublemakers
began
to
catcall
and
stamp
their
feet
others
wishing
to
avoid
trouble
rose
and
started
to
leave
the
hall
only
a
moment
mr
hall
begged
wait
there
is
a
box
at
the
door
for
your
contributions
mr
flail
professor
thorne
shouted
i
can
not
allow
you
to
appeal
for
funds
for
such
a
project
without
it
being
understood
what
your
qualifications
are
you
are
not
a
scientist
nor
ever
have
been
you
are
not
educated
or
trained
in
this
field
and
have
made
one
short
trip
north
that
due
only
to
the
kindness
and
generosity
of
williams
and
haven
the
whaling
firm
you
propose
to
ignore
the
experts
in
this
field
you
propose
another
wild
goose
chase
to
the
arctic
wasting
the
money
of
well
meaning
citizens
to
satisfy
your
own
morbid
curiosities
no
sir
i
can
not
countenance
this
nor
will
i
sir
you
are
a
humbug
and
an
impostor
wait
a
minute
mr
hall
held
his
hands
high
in
supplication
but
the
damage
had
been
done
wait
a
minute
please
all
of
you
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
tittering
started
a
cruel
tittering
that
grew
into
guffaws
and
jeers
sir
said
professor
thorne
with
finality
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
he
turned
and
walked
out
followed
by
dr
beckett
others
joined
in
the
exodus
please
listen
to
me
hurrying
down
from
the
stage
mr
hall
took
an
arm
in
town
she
kept
her
stomach
flat
and
her
chin
line
taut
a
goodly
part
of
her
income
went
to
hair
nails
massage
creams
and
unguents
other
women
said
she
must
be
older
than
she
looks
when
supporting
muscles
of
her
breasts
no
longer
responded
to
creams
massage
and
exercise
she
placed
them
in
shapely
forms
that
rode
high
and
jauntily
her
make
up
took
increasing
time
her
hair
had
all
the
sheen
luster
wave
the
television
products
promise
on
a
date
dining
dancing
laughing
amusing
drawing
her
escort
with
a
net
of
small
magnets
who
could
know
her
cold
sense
of
repetition
after
a
decent
interval
and
an
outlay
of
money
she
usually
went
to
bed
with
him
if
she
discreetly
could
then
back
to
her
fence
mending
sooner
or
later
the
shared
bed
must
be
the
trap
to
catch
her
future
security
and
ease
but
the
prospective
game
leaped
clear
of
the
quilted
jaws
more
and
more
of
her
dates
were
the
married
the
infirm
or
the
cautious
running
out
the
tarot
cards
did
not
respond
when
she
sought
help
for
herself
margie
had
known
many
men
most
of
them
guilty
wounded
in
their
vanity
or
despairing
so
that
she
had
developed
a
contempt
for
her
quarry
as
a
professional
hunter
of
vermin
does
it
was
easy
to
move
such
men
through
their
fears
and
their
vanities
they
ached
so
to
be
fooled
that
she
no
longer
felt
triumph
only
a
kind
of
disgusted
pity
these
were
her
friends
and
associates
she
protected
them
even
from
the
discovery
that
they
were
her
friends
she
gave
them
the
best
of
herself
because
they
demanded
nothing
of
her
she
kept
them
secret
because
at
the
bottom
she
did
not
admire
herself
danny
taylor
was
one
of
these
and
alfio
marullo
another
and
chief
stonewall
jackson
smith
a
third
and
there
were
others
they
trusted
her
and
she
them
and
their
secret
existence
was
the
one
warm
honesty
to
which
she
could
retire
to
restore
herself
these
friends
talked
freely
and
without
fear
of
andersen
s
well
receptive
unjudging
and
silent
as
most
people
have
secret
vices
margie
young
hunt
concealed
a
secret
virtue
and
because
of
this
quiet
thing
it
is
probable
that
she
knew
more
about
new
baytown
and
even
wessex
county
than
anyone
and
her
knowledge
was
unwarped
because
she
would
not
could
not
use
it
for
her
own
profit
but
in
other
fields
everything
that
came
to
her
hand
was
usable
her
project
ethan
allen
hawley
began
casually
and
out
of
idleness
in
a
way
he
was
correct
in
thinking
it
was
mischievous
a
testing
of
her
power
many
of
the
sad
men
who
came
to
her
for
comfort
and
reassurance
were
hogtied
with
impotence
bound
and
helpless
in
sexual
traumas
that
infected
all
other
areas
of
their
lives
and
she
found
it
easy
by
small
flatteries
and
reassurances
to
set
them
free
to
fight
again
against
their
whip
armed
wives
she
was
genuinely
fond
of
mary
hawley
and
through
her
she
gradually
became
aware
of
ethan
bound
in
another
kind
of
trauma
certainty
having
no
work
no
love
no
children
she
wondered
whether
she
could
release
and
direct
this
crippled
man
toward
some
new
end
it
was
a
game
a
kind
of
puzzle
a
test
a
product
not
of
kindness
but
simply
of
curiosity
and
idleness
this
was
a
superior
man
to
direct
him
would
prove
her
superiority
and
this
she
needed
increasingly
probably
she
was
the
only
one
who
knew
the
depth
of
the
change
in
ethan
and
it
frightened
her
because
she
thought
it
was
her
doing
the
mouse
was
growing
a
lion
s
mane
she
saw
the
muscles
under
his
clothes
felt
ruthlessness
growing
behind
his
eyes
so
must
the
gentle
einstein
have
felt
when
his
dreamed
concept
of
the
nature
of
matter
flashed
over
hiroshima
margie
liked
mary
hawley
very
much
and
she
had
little
sympathy
and
no
pity
for
her
misfortune
is
a
fact
of
nature
acceptable
to
women
especially
when
it
falls
on
other
women
in
her
tiny
immaculate
house
set
in
a
large
overgrown
garden
very
mirror
to
inspect
her
tools
and
her
eyes
saw
through
cream
powder
eye
shadowing
and
lashes
sheathed
in
black
saw
the
hidden
wrinkles
the
inelasticity
of
skin
she
felt
the
years
creep
up
like
the
rising
tide
about
a
rock
in
a
calm
sea
there
is
an
arsenal
of
maturity
of
middle
age
but
these
require
training
and
technique
she
did
not
yet
have
she
must
learn
them
before
her
structure
of
youth
and
excitement
crumbled
and
left
her
naked
rotten
ridiculous
her
success
had
been
that
she
never
let
down
even
alone
now
as
an
experiment
she
allowed
her
mouth
to
droop
as
it
wanted
to
her
eyelids
to
fall
half
staff
shep
lowered
her
high
held
chin
and
a
plaited
rope
came
into
being
before
her
in
the
mirror
she
saw
twenty
years
clamber
over
her
and
she
shuddered
as
the
icy
whispering
told
her
what
lay
waiting
she
had
delayed
too
long
a
woman
must
have
a
showcase
in
which
to
grow
old
lights
props
and
pilfering
love
protection
and
small
change
a
serene
and
undemanding
husband
or
his
even
more
serene
and
less
demanding
will
and
trust
fund
a
woman
growing
old
alone
is
useless
cast
off
trash
a
wrinkled
obscenity
with
no
hobbled
retainers
to
cluck
and
mutter
over
her
aches
and
to
rub
her
pains
a
hot
spot
of
fear
formed
in
her
stomach
she
had
been
lucky
in
her
first
husband
he
was
weak
and
she
soon
found
the
valve
of
his
weakness
he
was
hopelessly
in
love
with
her
so
much
so
that
when
she
needed
a
divorce
he
did
not
ask
for
a
remarriage
clause
in
his
alimony
settlement
her
second
husband
thought
she
had
a
private
fortune
and
so
she
had
he
did
nt
leave
her
much
when
he
died
but
with
the
alimony
from
her
first
husband
she
could
live
decently
dress
recall
and
clean
and
charming
the
chair
by
the
goldfishbowl
which
i
quickly
appropriated
as
my
old
man
chair
where
i
sat
constantly
sipping
port
for
a
whole
week
the
kitchen
with
its
intelligent
arrangements
of
spices
and
eggs
in
the
icebox
and
for
that
matter
too
the
poor
little
son
of
billie
sleeping
in
a
well
arranged
back
room
her
son
from
her
deceased
husband
who
was
also
a
railroadman
elliott
the
child
s
name
and
i
did
nt
get
to
see
him
till
later
that
night
and
with
the
huge
packet
of
cody
s
san
quentin
letters
in
her
hand
she
launches
forth
on
her
theories
about
cody
and
eternity
but
all
i
can
keep
saying
as
i
swig
from
my
bottle
is
julien
you
re
talking
too
much
julien
julien
my
god
who
d
ever
dream
i
d
run
into
a
woman
who
looks
like
julien
you
look
like
julien
but
you
re
not
julien
and
on
top
of
that
you
re
a
woman
how
goddam
strange
in
fact
she
had
to
pack
me
off
to
bed
drunk
but
not
before
being
absolutely
true
but
the
main
thing
being
that
tho
she
looked
like
julien
etc
and
had
cody
s
big
sad
abstract
letters
about
karma
in
a
ribbon
and
actually
went
out
in
the
morning
and
earned
a
hundred
a
week
in
fashion
modeling
she
had
the
most
musical
beautiful
and
sad
voice
i
ve
ever
heard
in
my
life
the
things
she
s
saying
are
really
rather
inane
because
after
all
her
education
is
based
on
really
californian
hysterias
like
the
earlier
mistress
of
cody
rosemarie
who
also
was
thin
and
pale
haired
and
crazy
and
kept
talking
abstract
like
she
s
saying
i
thought
i
could
do
something
to
ease
the
contradiction
between
immanent
and
universal
ethics
which
i
thought
was
my
problem
and
was
what
i
hoped
to
gain
thru
therapy
like
any
evolution
presupposes
an
involution
and
all
that
kind
of
thinking
as
i
sigh
but
she
does
say
something
interesting
once
in
a
while
like
while
cody
was
in
prison
my
main
occupation
was
praying
for
him
i
had
an
all
day
going
there
was
also
a
bit
we
did
together
every
evening
something
else
is
happening
i
m
not
sure
what
but
i
m
sure
we
aid
the
storm
when
we
transcend
time
in
one
respect
and
ca
nt
even
keep
up
with
it
in
others
but
also
all
kinds
of
to
me
unimportant
and
uninteresting
crap
about
channels
about
people
being
either
closed
or
open
channels
and
cody
is
a
big
open
channel
pouring
out
all
his
holy
gysm
on
heaven
i
really
cant
remember
or
the
destinies
the
sighs
the
rooftops
of
all
that
the
stars
are
shining
down
on
their
poor
heads
as
they
draw
breath
to
explain
inanities
really
like
the
letters
to
her
i
glance
at
them
are
all
about
how
they
ve
met
and
their
souls
have
collided
in
this
dimension
because
of
some
unfulfilled
karma
on
another
planet
and
in
another
plane
that
is
and
now
they
have
to
gird
themselves
to
assume
this
big
responsibility
to
meet
some
measure
of
this
and
that
i
do
nt
even
wanta
go
into
it
because
also
the
fact
of
the
matter
being
when
willamine
talks
to
me
i
sad
music
of
her
voice
and
in
the
strange
circumstance
i
guess
karma
like
too
that
she
looks
like
poor
julien
her
voice
is
the
main
point
she
talks
with
a
broken
heart
her
voice
lutes
brokenly
like
a
heart
lost
musically
too
like
in
a
lost
grove
it
s
almost
too
much
to
bear
sometimes
like
some
fantastic
futuristic
jerry
southern
singer
in
a
night
club
who
steps
up
to
the
mike
in
the
spotlight
in
las
vegas
but
does
nt
even
have
to
sing
just
talk
to
make
men
sigh
and
women
wonder
i
guess
if
women
ever
wonder
so
that
as
she
s
trying
to
explain
all
that
nonsense
to
me
all
that
philosophy
of
hers
and
cody
s
and
cody
s
new
buddy
perry
coming
up
the
next
day
i
just
sit
and
marvel
and
stare
at
her
mouth
wondering
where
all
the
beauty
is
coming
from
and
why
and
we
end
up
making
love
sweetly
too
a
little
blonde
well
experienced
in
all
the
facets
of
lovemaking
and
sweet
with
compassion
and
just
too
much
so
that
b
dawn
we
in
a
week
in
fact
i
can
see
it
now
a
great
big
four
way
marriage
with
cody
and
evelyn
for
she
is
the
great
enemy
of
evelyn
she
s
not
satisfied
just
to
be
cody
s
lover
and
soul
heart
she
wants
to
go
right
over
there
and
lay
evelyn
down
on
the
line
and
take
cody
away
with
her
forever
and
to
do
this
she
ll
even
have
a
deadend
heaven
deep
love
affair
with
old
jack
same
pattern
of
old
there
s
not
much
difference
between
her
and
evelyn
when
you
listen
to
their
talk
about
cody
except
in
evelyn
s
case
i
m
always
fascinatedly
interested
billie
actually
bores
me
tho
of
course
i
cant
tell
her
that
evelyn
is
still
the
champ
and
i
wonder
about
cody
the
ups
and
downs
and
juggling
of
women
blondes
at
that
all
in
the
great
magical
city
of
the
gandharvas
of
san
francisco
and
here
i
am
alone
on
a
magic
carpet
with
one
of
em
whee
at
first
of
course
it
s
a
great
ball
a
great
new
eye
shattering
explosion
of
experience
not
dreaming
i
my
arms
and
my
name
billie
too
now
billie
and
billie
arm
in
arm
oh
beautiful
and
cody
has
given
his
consent
in
a
way
we
go
roaming
the
genghiz
khan
clouds
of
soft
love
and
hope
and
anybody
who
s
never
done
this
is
crazy
because
a
new
love
affair
always
gives
hope
the
irrational
mortal
loneliness
is
always
crowned
that
thing
i
saw
that
horror
of
snake
emptiness
when
i
took
get
over
their
love
affair
with
themselves
love
affair
ah
you
know
you
loved
it
she
said
spinning
out
yourself
because
meanwhile
you
did
nt
have
to
do
anything
about
anything
or
anybody
would
it
have
been
better
if
i
d
had
t
b
something
that
showed
she
put
a
hand
out
toward
him
almost
touching
his
knee
then
drew
it
back
i
kept
thinking
of
them
all
the
time
all
the
wives
and
husbands
and
parents
of
the
the
time
smoothing
things
over
picking
up
the
pieces
holding
their
breath
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
stop
living
if
you
felt
like
that
why
did
nt
you
say
some
oh
no
she
said
quickly
i
was
nt
supposed
to
interrupt
or
intrude
it
was
true
he
thought
what
she
had
represented
these
three
years
had
been
the
damaging
real
which
he
had
avoided
even
as
he
fought
his
way
toward
it
i
know
it
has
nt
been
easy
for
you
he
said
humbly
perhaps
that
was
part
of
my
trouble
that
i
did
nt
think
enough
about
that
but
now
what
s
now
she
looked
down
at
her
clenched
hands
people
like
me
will
always
be
on
the
outside
with
people
like
you
he
got
up
heavily
from
the
bed
and
crossed
to
the
window
god
save
us
he
thought
us
and
see
it
whole
from
those
who
ca
nt
bury
or
evade
the
truth
but
have
to
drag
it
out
and
beat
it
like
a
carpet
who
can
say
the
raw
the
open
thing
that
can
never
be
glozed
over
again
he
stared
out
the
window
twisting
one
hand
around
and
around
in
his
pants
pocket
come
on
he
said
let
s
go
up
to
the
ewarts
no
i
do
nt
want
to
go
after
all
well
for
god
s
sake
he
said
sore
with
his
new
effort
you
re
always
the
one
who
s
trying
to
drag
me
because
it
was
better
than
being
alone
together
she
shrugged
smiling
crookedly
up
at
him
besides
saturday
night
one
always
hopes
for
the
best
come
on
then
he
met
the
smile
with
a
placating
one
of
his
own
no
it
s
just
you
know
she
said
like
a
record
we
all
play
once
a
week
jim
hanging
around
waiting
for
esther
to
get
drunk
enough
so
she
ll
go
home
and
karen
watching
lou
for
her
reasons
and
me
watching
you
for
mine
i
just
do
nt
want
any
part
of
it
any
more
he
watched
it
almost
jealously
that
soft
flexible
look
of
hers
which
concealed
the
enviable
certitude
the
stubborn
strength
to
reject
to
decide
well
what
do
you
want
to
do
she
looked
away
from
him
consciously
i
thought
i
d
go
back
home
for
a
while
if
you
re
really
on
your
feet
now
for
a
while
or
for
good
he
said
for
good
he
thought
that
s
what
she
asked
only
a
little
while
ago
she
was
silent
what
makes
you
think
utica
or
any
other
place
is
nt
more
of
the
same
these
days
where
i
just
ca
nt
go
on
being
an
adjunct
any
more
and
libby
he
softened
his
voice
suddenly
as
if
their
joint
concern
might
wake
her
where
their
forgetfulness
had
not
she
put
her
head
down
in
her
hands
rubbing
her
concealed
face
back
and
forth
she
ll
cry
now
he
thought
although
he
could
not
remember
when
he
had
last
seen
her
cry
and
he
waited
almost
with
relief
for
with
women
the
lucky
women
this
meant
the
dissolving
of
an
issue
the
haggled
end
of
emotion
but
she
went
on
defeatedly
rocking
come
on
he
said
after
a
moment
i
ll
fix
us
a
drink
he
waited
and
then
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
we
ll
have
a
party
by
ourselves
in
the
kitchen
his
hands
took
over
the
mixing
of
the
martinis
picking
out
and
combining
the
gin
the
vermouth
the
lemon
peel
with
disembodied
competence
he
thought
is
nt
it
is
nt
it
he
said
defensively
to
the
dry
voice
in
the
anonymous
room
he
thought
of
the
crowd
upstairs
now
at
the
ewarts
in
the
pattern
as
dorothy
had
said
pooling
all
their
uncertainties
of
the
week
drowning
them
in
the
fabricated
bonhomie
of
saturday
night
the
ewarts
syl
and
harry
were
a
few
years
older
than
the
average
couple
in
the
building
and
were
both
in
business
perhaps
it
was
a
combination
of
these
facts
which
led
them
into
great
spurts
of
energy
in
which
droves
of
people
must
be
enlisted
to
help
them
kill
the
weekend
s
frightening
acreage
of
time
to
their
coarse
grained
parties
there
came
patronizingly
the
fledgling
physicists
the
writers
on
their
way
to
a
foothold
the
confused
but
verbose
young
men
with
their
foetally
promising
jobs
in
the
government
in
the
state
department
or
like
himself
in
the
universities
they
came
because
they
were
at
loose
ends
or
at
odds
with
of
the
city
or
let
it
be
said
because
the
ewarts
could
serve
the
liquor
they
themselves
could
infrequently
afford
and
with
each
of
them
came
the
wife
in
the
new
hair
do
the
primary
colored
dress
with
its
attempted
primary
appeal
all
the
intelligent
frustrated
girls
fleeing
from
the
diapers
toward
an
evening
in
which
they
could
forget
their
altered
conceptions
of
themselves
he
held
the
martini
mixer
up
to
the
light
and
stirred
forestalling
the
thought
of
dorothy
and
himself
with
critical
thoughts
of
the
others
it
s
true
what
she
said
he
thought
esther
having
to
drink
herself
into
insensibility
more
and
more
often
with
jim
doggedly
watching
and
karen
flitting
grimly
unobtrusively
into
the
kitchen
now
and
then
to
see
that
lou
s
reflex
skirt
chasing
does
nt
get
him
in
more
trouble
than
he
can
handle
and
me
wrapped
up
in
a
corner
for
once
let
s
not
think
about
me
he
said
defiantly
to
the
voice
in
the
repudiated
room
and
with
reassurances
to
the
sufferers
administering
glasses
know
how
you
ve
been
you
ve
been
fine
well
that
would
seem
to
cover
that
what
do
you
want
bill
dan
has
your
headquarters
boat
left
left
for
where
the
invasion
you
said
there
d
be
one
it
s
not
even
chartered
yet
oh
i
heard
the
movement
had
started
and
it
has
started
but
we
have
nt
not
this
and
holding
an
inauguration
and
a
ball
couple
of
balls
all
kinds
of
various
things
more
important
than
taking
the
field
why
i
want
to
be
taken
on
board
in
what
capacity
as
trader
in
cotton
you
are
going
to
buy
cotton
bill
that
s
the
idea
dan
i
have
nt
told
you
all
about
what
brought
me
to
town
i
then
sketched
it
out
quick
the
plan
i
d
made
with
sandy
and
my
need
for
twenty
five
thousand
dollars
i
went
on
from
all
that
i
hear
around
the
quickest
way
to
get
money
is
to
join
this
red
river
thing
seems
to
be
like
picking
the
stuff
off
trees
if
you
can
get
on
this
boat
and
if
you
tell
me
no
lies
but
what
lies
have
i
been
telling
that
you
re
taking
this
trip
to
make
money
well
that
girl
she
left
for
red
river
last
week
but
listen
i
need
twenty
five
thousand
dollars
i
know
you
do
bill
i
know
all
about
it
then
where
does
the
lie
come
in
bill
ever
hear
of
a
man
named
dumont
the
banker
i
know
him
yes
he
was
in
asking
about
you
said
miss
tremaine
the
lady
you
brought
to
the
ball
was
fixing
to
marry
you
then
sell
her
business
out
and
back
you
in
another
with
the
money
you
needed
he
was
for
it
if
you
were
an
honest
man
but
if
you
already
have
the
twenty
five
thousand
promised
it
proves
you
re
lying
does
nt
it
what
did
you
say
about
me
nice
stuff
he
went
away
quite
happy
could
be
i
d
rather
make
that
tin
myself
and
could
be
you
d
rather
have
mrs
fournet
interrupted
to
know
how
i
could
make
any
tin
knowing
nothing
about
cotton
at
all
i
said
what
s
to
know
dan
i
go
on
your
boat
as
a
trader
i
pile
off
at
alexandria
along
with
the
other
traders
i
buy
stock
off
a
reb
which
i
still
have
money
to
do
i
write
up
my
receipt
listing
bales
by
mark
number
and
weight
i
present
it
to
the
q
m
officer
making
the
seizure
for
him
to
sign
the
rest
is
up
to
the
lawyers
is
any
of
that
beyond
my
comprehension
bill
i
ve
told
you
that
cotton
is
hooded
hoodooed
this
is
not
halloween
i
m
not
talking
about
halloween
or
anything
superstitious
all
right
call
it
attaindered
but
i
m
telling
you
it
ll
ruin
whoever
touches
it
including
you
including
burke
including
landry
including
mrs
fournet
who
s
a
damned
pretty
girl
mixed
up
in
a
damned
ugly
is
trying
this
army
is
trying
to
buy
a
piece
of
this
war
to
pay
for
our
invasion
by
taking
traders
along
by
letting
them
put
out
tin
for
the
cotton
the
rebs
have
in
storage
i
m
telling
you
it
ca
nt
be
done
there
s
one
piece
of
land
that
s
never
yet
been
up
for
sale
and
that
s
the
half
acre
you
need
to
plant
a
flagpole
on
that
you
have
to
take
it
s
a
people
s
maidenhead
it
wo
nt
give
in
by
itself
and
its
price
is
blood
it
s
what
we
re
forgetting
but
we
ll
pay
the
price
that
price
or
i
m
badly
mistaken
oh
our
motives
are
good
why
the
hell
would
nt
they
be
what
motive
s
not
better
than
war
the
idea
washington
thinks
is
to
kill
three
birds
with
one
stone
block
the
reb
government
from
shipping
the
cotton
abroad
and
buying
guns
with
it
give
some
individual
rebs
a
lick
at
the
sugar
pot
northern
mills
some
stock
to
make
shirts
with
for
our
soldiers
all
right
but
the
only
time
i
ever
let
go
at
three
birds
on
a
limb
i
broke
the
dining
room
window
cut
my
grandfather
s
head
and
landed
a
rock
in
my
mother
s
soup
but
this
will
be
worse
it
s
treason
why
it
takes
two
to
make
a
sale
and
in
a
war
that
means
dealing
with
the
enemy
the
reb
army
if
they
let
that
cotton
lay
if
they
fail
to
burn
it
when
they
evacuate
alexandria
have
already
heard
the
word
as
it
s
been
passed
up
the
line
and
we
if
we
pass
the
wink
to
the
owners
those
rebs
licking
up
sugar
as
we
make
the
confiscation
we
re
dealing
with
the
enemy
too
but
you
say
not
much
just
a
little
bit
but
i
say
remember
that
maidenhead
there
s
no
such
thing
as
one
that
s
been
slightly
took
and
there
s
going
to
be
trouble
now
why
i
say
that
cotton
is
hooded
do
i
have
to
say
more
i
thought
you
were
my
friend
dan
i
m
talking
as
your
friend
you
do
nt
sound
much
like
it
i
ll
prove
it
my
orders
are
to
pass
you
pass
me
you
mean
to
go
on
that
boat
yes
that
s
what
i
mean
well
why
do
nt
you
bill
do
you
know
what
impressed
mr
dumont
not
your
annapolis
life
which
i
did
nt
know
too
much
about
if
i
have
to
tell
you
the
truth
but
what
you
did
right
here
that
brought
him
out
of
his
chair
for
landry
are
you
talking
about
that
s
right
and
it
impressed
us
too
who
is
us
this
whole
headquarters
they
hated
it
of
course
but
they
respected
you
for
it
and
and
unfortunately
might
blow
this
whole
ship
out
of
water
so
the
word
came
to
me
pass
this
man
in
if
he
wants
well
if
i
m
identifying
and
discarding
just
such
radar
signals
fail
safe
the
briefing
our
big
operation
at
omaha
of
course
probably
at
least
one
other
stand
by
then
there
was
the
president
s
bomb
shelter
probably
another
computerized
strategy
board
layout
there
maybe
there
was
more
than
one
presidential
bomb
shelter
maybe
one
at
camp
david
or
the
summer
white
house
or
who
knows
where
else
then
in
addition
he
knew
there
was
always
every
minute
of
every
day
a
converted
kc
aloft
a
miniature
emergency
omaha
in
case
everything
else
should
blow
probably
another
one
on
some
super
aircraft
carrier
somewhere
still
another
on
one
of
the
nuclear
submarines
how
many
others
several
in
england
certainly
france
perhaps
and
west
germany
russia
yes
surely
there
would
be
almost
as
many
as
there
are
in
the
united
states
black
knew
that
four
kc
s
were
reserved
exclusively
for
presidential
use
as
a
flying
command
post
in
case
of
emergency
since
they
had
been
scattered
about
the
country
so
that
the
president
was
never
far
from
one
whenever
the
president
flew
overseas
one
of
these
planes
was
quietly
and
unobtrusively
included
in
his
was
similar
and
the
men
in
them
too
today
throughout
the
world
in
each
one
of
the
big
board
rooms
staffed
by
busy
competent
dedicated
men
probably
the
same
signals
were
being
received
analyzed
and
projected
the
big
brass
everywhere
was
watching
similar
strategy
boards
studying
the
same
blips
thinking
out
or
talking
out
the
same
strategic
puzzles
groteschele
was
now
discussing
black
plugged
back
into
the
discussion
groteschele
was
now
classifying
various
types
of
possible
machine
errors
accidental
war
caused
by
some
machine
failure
miscalculation
by
the
computers
misinterpretation
by
the
staff
of
human
interpreters
the
overriders
as
the
computer
boys
call
them
and
then
the
big
one
electronic
failure
big
black
thought
because
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
we
just
know
that
in
any
system
so
complex
and
so
dependent
upon
intricate
electronic
equipment
the
possibility
of
electronic
failure
or
error
must
always
be
borne
in
mind
but
the
positive
control
fail
safe
system
is
the
ultimate
protection
against
mechanical
failure
this
was
the
ultimate
safety
factor
in
the
whole
system
this
was
where
it
all
rested
so
we
were
all
reassured
and
indeed
groteschele
was
very
reassuring
today
except
that
his
nervous
chuckle
kept
getting
in
the
way
black
understood
why
groteschele
knew
more
than
he
was
saying
it
just
was
not
that
simple
everyone
knew
it
who
had
anything
to
do
with
the
black
boxes
of
the
positive
control
system
their
components
were
per
cent
double
checked
on
regular
rotation
schedules
every
possible
condition
to
which
the
equipment
might
be
subjected
in
operation
was
simulated
it
was
simulated
in
actual
duplication
systems
and
it
was
also
simulated
on
computers
with
meticulously
devised
mathematical
formulas
expressing
every
possible
way
the
equipment
might
fail
on
computers
the
bombers
were
flown
and
the
go
signals
were
given
variable
atmospheric
conditions
could
be
predicted
operational
deterioration
of
the
equipment
could
be
estimated
vibration
characteristics
of
the
vindicator
bombers
could
be
factored
in
stress
variables
could
be
translated
into
mathematical
formulas
and
with
these
but
the
whole
system
had
one
big
flaw
in
it
nobody
could
ever
be
certain
that
the
black
boxes
would
actually
work
properly
in
a
showdown
the
reason
was
simple
there
had
fail
safe
never
been
a
showdown
and
there
could
never
be
a
sure
test
showdown
a
showdown
meant
war
the
whole
positive
control
system
really
depended
on
equipment
that
could
never
really
be
tested
until
the
time
came
for
its
first
use
and
because
of
this
nobody
could
ever
really
know
in
advance
whether
or
not
it
would
work
right
the
fail
safe
machines
could
be
truly
tested
only
once
the
single
time
they
were
used
there
was
ample
evidence
from
the
experience
of
the
electra
planes
and
the
now
obsolete
dc
s
that
a
serious
flaw
in
an
elaborate
machine
could
survive
every
experimental
situation
and
then
in
real
practice
come
completely
unstuck
this
was
material
for
the
grim
inside
humor
which
went
the
rounds
of
sac
gossip
the
dc
had
been
a
beautiful
drawing
board
plane
except
that
the
first
ones
to
go
into
service
caught
fire
in
flight
had
nt
calculated
was
what
flight
wind
currents
would
do
to
fuel
overflow
spillage
the
fuel
was
deflected
by
an
invisible
band
of
air
to
a
point
directly
behind
the
engines
where
the
air
intake
vents
sucked
in
the
gas
spillage
converting
the
plane
s
storage
compartment
into
a
quite
unplanned
fire
chamber
great
corporations
can
also
be
injured
when
their
computerized
positive
control
systems
break
down
black
remembered
the
consternation
a
few
years
back
when
fortune
had
demonstrated
this
point
about
general
dynamics
the
convair
was
a
million
dollar
demonstration
of
the
fallibility
of
computerized
simulation
convair
designed
a
drawing
board
airplane
that
checked
out
to
be
the
fastest
commercial
jet
in
the
computer
flight
tests
so
they
decided
to
save
money
skip
the
costly
prototype
stage
and
go
directly
into
production
only
the
did
nt
perform
as
designed
nobody
knew
why
and
the
enigmatic
computers
that
had
been
so
reassuring
could
not
be
charged
with
malfeasance
the
briefing
general
black
also
knew
that
groteschele
was
sliding
past
another
important
factor
each
machine
had
to
be
adjusted
their
training
suffered
from
fatigue
and
boredom
many
was
the
time
that
general
black
had
seen
a
tired
and
irritated
mechanic
turn
a
screwdriver
a
half
turn
too
far
fail
to
make
one
last
check
ignore
a
negative
reading
on
a
testing
instrument
on
a
plane
such
errors
would
mean
only
that
an
expensive
piece
of
machinery
and
a
few
men
would
be
lost
on
a
fail
safe
black
box
and
the
men
who
adjusted
and
installed
them
had
not
the
remotest
notion
of
what
they
were
the
slightest
accident
could
trigger
the
final
disaster
black
glanced
around
the
table
stark
was
watching
the
strategy
board
new
blips
had
just
appeared
and
stark
was
toying
nightgown
by
six
o
clock
the
sun
had
been
high
enough
to
make
the
heat
shimmer
in
the
air
again
looking
to
the
east
and
squinting
to
block
out
the
sun
she
could
make
out
the
sierra
nevada
swimming
clear
on
the
horizon
she
wanted
to
go
somewhere
but
did
not
know
where
there
was
a
glass
of
beer
on
the
table
left
from
the
night
before
and
she
flicked
a
small
colorless
spider
from
the
rim
with
her
fingernail
and
let
the
warm
flat
beer
trickle
down
her
throat
that
there
was
really
nowhere
to
go
she
did
not
like
the
mountains
and
had
only
a
week
before
come
home
from
the
coast
made
her
no
less
restless
lying
almost
motionless
in
the
still
morning
heat
and
chewing
absently
on
the
sash
to
her
nightgown
she
her
grades
had
arrived
from
berkeley
yesterday
neatly
and
irrevocably
recorded
on
the
self
addressed
postcards
she
had
left
in
her
bluebooks
one
b
minus
in
english
b
pa
c
in
history
a
a
c
in
psychology
b
a
c
minus
in
geology
commonly
known
as
a
football
players
course
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
get
below
a
b
and
a
d
in
french
because
the
single
b
was
in
a
three
unit
course
and
the
d
in
a
four
unit
course
she
supposed
that
she
was
down
grade
points
and
therefore
on
probation
had
the
postcards
arrived
at
school
she
would
have
been
embarrassed
here
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
as
her
mother
had
observed
she
had
read
some
interesting
books
and
gone
to
some
nice
parties
once
she
was
home
that
was
about
the
sum
of
berkeley
she
did
not
want
to
go
back
anyway
she
could
read
books
at
home
she
could
have
a
better
time
at
parties
at
home
it
was
not
that
to
the
parties
which
were
the
parties
to
go
to
she
had
on
a
campus
where
healthy
color
and
easy
smiles
were
commonplace
her
fragile
pallor
her
uncertainty
had
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
and
speculation
only
when
the
boys
who
asked
her
out
discovered
how
real
the
uncertainty
was
did
they
begin
bewildered
and
bored
to
lose
interest
as
one
of
them
told
lily
s
roommate
who
reprovingly
told
lily
taking
out
lily
knight
was
like
dating
a
deaf
mute
you
have
to
kid
around
with
them
be
more
fun
the
roommate
advised
be
yourself
although
these
admonitions
seemed
to
lily
in
some
sense
contradictory
she
tried
the
next
weekend
to
be
more
like
the
girls
who
were
considered
fun
out
with
a
sigma
chi
who
had
just
been
accepted
at
princeton
theological
seminary
she
had
attempted
some
banter
about
reinhold
niebuhr
when
that
failed
she
admired
the
way
he
played
the
ukelele
after
several
drinks
he
although
she
neither
understood
them
nor
thought
he
should
be
telling
them
to
her
she
laughed
appreciatively
when
he
asked
if
she
would
like
to
drive
up
in
the
berkeley
hills
shep
smiled
with
delight
and
said
it
sounded
like
fun
later
she
reflected
that
it
had
not
been
entirely
his
fault
that
he
had
misinterpreted
her
behavior
that
evening
which
had
ended
in
front
of
an
all
night
drugstore
on
shattuck
avenue
where
the
prospective
theologian
told
lily
he
could
get
some
rubbers
rubbers
she
had
said
and
he
had
looked
at
her
safes
contraceptives
she
had
begun
shaking
her
head
then
unable
to
think
what
to
say
and
he
sobered
had
driven
her
in
silence
up
the
hill
to
the
pi
phi
house
after
that
she
had
refused
all
invitations
for
three
weeks
during
the
spring
semester
she
had
gone
out
briefly
with
a
graduate
student
who
read
for
her
psychology
class
a
jewish
boy
from
new
york
city
named
leonard
sachs
he
had
the
people
lily
knew
they
had
taken
long
walks
in
the
hills
above
the
stadium
back
through
strawberry
canyon
had
eaten
dinner
by
candlelight
in
the
small
apartment
he
shared
with
a
friend
who
did
not
like
lily
and
made
a
point
of
going
to
the
library
whenever
she
was
around
and
had
sat
on
thursday
nights
in
the
empty
box
at
the
san
francisco
symphony
for
which
the
pi
phis
paid
every
year
he
gave
her
articles
clipped
from
the
new
republic
outlining
the
intrinsic
immorality
of
an
itinerant
labor
force
hunted
up
for
her
an
old
pamphlet
demanding
repeal
of
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law
took
her
to
san
francisco
on
the
f
train
to
hear
a
tribute
to
harry
bridges
and
urged
her
after
he
had
observed
her
knitting
a
sweater
for
her
father
to
utilize
what
slender
talents
she
had
by
teaching
handicrafts
in
a
settlement
house
unable
to
locate
settlement
houses
in
the
berkeley
yellow
pages
she
finally
abandoned
that
project
he
referred
to
the
ranch
as
your
father
s
farm
and
which
he
held
defective
mechanisms
and
the
craven
de
light
he
secretly
took
in
luxury
merchandise
she
asked
him
if
he
would
not
miss
being
home
at
easter
and
regarded
him
in
constant
and
only
occasionally
unwilling
wonder
what
both
aggravated
and
enthralled
him
was
her
total
freedom
from
his
personal
and
social
furies
and
those
eumenides
at
his
back
were
what
attracted
and
repelled
lily
you
re
my
haunted
lover
she
would
laugh
although
he
was
literally
neither
a
fact
which
in
his
roommate
s
eyes
tended
to
confirm
lily
s
social
uselessness
she
had
even
invited
him
up
the
river
for
a
day
during
spring
week
once
home
she
regretted
having
asked
him
but
he
was
delighted
by
the
prospect
of
observing
her
in
her
native
decay
and
so
she
drove
to
sacramento
to
meet
him
one
morning
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
standing
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
southern
pacific
station
radiating
the
same
intense
concern
which
had
first
charmed
her
in
berkeley
she
knew
that
alien
to
the
valley
as
she
might
have
been
to
the
bronx
and
the
alienation
went
deeper
than
his
black
as
a
mariner
adrift
in
a
night
without
stars
might
long
for
a
sextant
by
saturday
night
however
he
had
made
a
makeshift
instrument
from
a
week
of
plumber
and
electrician
estimates
he
sat
in
bad
light
picking
bits
of
a
bad
supper
from
his
teeth
with
a
toothpick
and
staring
at
the
black
shine
of
the
night
backed
window
moonbloom
had
become
moonbloon
and
a
leg
of
the
remaining
n
was
chipping
away
would
soon
become
what
moonbloor
above
his
brother
s
name
was
stolidly
permanently
still
moonbloom
he
sensed
people
passing
occasionally
saw
the
mirror
like
window
briefly
transparent
in
the
light
of
a
passing
car
mostly
though
there
was
just
the
image
of
himself
cadaverous
in
the
overhead
light
a
sort
of
grotesque
portrait
of
an
executive
based
by
people
lived
over
his
office
too
and
what
were
they
like
could
they
all
be
as
horrible
and
dangerous
as
his
own
tenants
for
a
moment
he
shivered
at
the
thought
of
the
infinitely
long
list
of
complaints
of
all
the
millions
good
god
he
thought
what
would
the
advancement
that
irwin
had
once
promised
entail
for
him
longer
lists
more
complicated
charts
of
tormenting
complexity
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
really
did
nt
want
the
opportunity
irwin
had
promised
or
threatened
why
then
was
he
laboring
so
mightily
to
do
something
because
he
now
seemed
to
have
no
choice
because
he
was
not
like
that
mariner
setting
out
from
a
port
but
rather
one
adrift
in
an
empty
ocean
his
movement
no
longer
dictated
by
ambition
but
by
a
need
to
survive
somehow
he
had
been
cast
into
the
inferno
of
people
at
this
point
it
did
nt
matter
whose
hand
had
done
the
casting
pipes
ran
a
hissing
came
from
the
he
scanned
the
spread
out
papers
covered
with
figures
and
notations
and
telephone
numbers
on
a
clean
sheet
he
accumulated
what
seemed
to
be
the
facts
the
total
cost
for
what
he
considered
to
be
the
minimal
repairs
came
to
five
thousand
three
hundred
and
eighty
seven
dollars
and
twenty
two
cents
the
owed
rent
counting
what
sheryl
beeler
had
cheated
him
out
of
came
to
a
hundred
and
seventy
three
fifty
irwin
expected
on
or
about
the
first
of
the
year
a
total
of
seven
weeks
rental
roughly
thirty
five
hundred
out
of
which
he
would
deposit
some
five
hundred
for
maintenance
this
meant
that
norman
would
be
in
the
red
for
approximately
he
began
to
laugh
caught
himself
and
shivered
the
mirth
to
a
stop
he
picked
up
the
pen
and
tried
all
over
again
conscious
that
he
was
floating
in
a
stream
of
lunacy
yet
unable
to
stop
paddling
and
was
he
including
what
needed
to
be
repaired
in
the
tenants
suppose
he
made
a
list
of
those
things
too
tried
to
find
dollars
for
the
hausers

new
hearts
six

one
for

souls
must
come
high
he
began
to
laugh
again
but
stopped
chilled
when
it
turned
to
screaming
he
looked
around
wildly
ready
for
collapse
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
a
date
with
sheryl
beeler
for
that
evening
and
numbed
with
amazement
he
was
able
to
collect
himself
even
to
the
towering
fedora
and
he
got
up
put
his
coat
on
with
mechanical
motions
and
went
to
his
rendezvous
he
knocked
softly
at
the
door
and
was
almost
bowled
over
by
its
sudden
opening
sheryl
stood
before
him
in
low
cut
splendor
as
bright
as
a
poster
in
a
red
dress
and
gleaming
lipstick
and
a
silvered
jewelry
sword
pointing
toward
her
just
this
minute
got
in
come
on
in
and
make
yourself
at
home
she
smelled
powerfully
of
some
unnaturally
sweet
flower
and
norman
partly
dazed
partly
incredulous
came
blinking
out
of
the
dark
hallway
lemme
just
slip
into
something
more
comfy
she
said
norman
could
nt
believe
that
she
had
actually
said
that
and
he
slumped
onto
the
couch
and
stared
at
the
depression
in
beeler
s
empty
chair
he
heard
the
water
running
in
the
bathroom
the
feeble
sound
of
the
faulty
toilet
flushing
and
from
another
room
the
sound
of
snoring
very
loud
and
emphatic
he
wondered
whether
at
this
late
date
he
might
lose
his
virginity
the
thought
did
nt
excite
him
because
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
that
was
real
about
his
presence
there
sheryl
came
back
in
the
dragon
kimono
and
swished
by
him
to
the
television
set
hypnotized
he
looked
past
her
broad
silken
back
to
watch
the
small
square
burst
open
into
a
scene
of
a
smily
band
spilling
of
hot
fudge
on
hollow
metal
pans
music
to
dance
to
sheryl
said
holding
her
arms
out
in
invitation
beyond
fear
norman
went
to
her
grasped
the
warm
resiliency
of
her
torso
and
began
earnestly
to
do
the
two
step
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
able
to
concentrate
on
the
unfamiliar
fact
of
his
dancing
he
looked
down
past
his
arm
to
the
imitation
persian
rug
guiding
himself
in
the
pattern
that
made
an
invisible
checkerboard
of
the
floor
one
two
slide
then
sideways
one
two
slide
the
music
oozed
over
him
as
he
navigated
the
boxes
dancing
and
this
step
so
appropriate
for
him
his
dance
of
life
beeler
snored
the
toilet
tank
drained
feebly
one
two
slide
one
two
slide
they
passed
the
lamp
and
sheryl
deftly
switched
it
off
without
breaking
the
rigid
form
of
his
dance
one
two
slide
he
could
barely
see
the
floor
which
was
now
lit
one
two
slide
one
two
slide
there
was
a
warm
trembling
against
his
body
as
sheryl
laughed
silently
one
two
slide
he
emphasized
the
roots
of
his
hair
planted
in
sweat
so
that
his
head
felt
like
a
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
so
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
the
sadness
of
the
afterward
when
their
loving
was
done
chiara
had
given
a
small
contented
sigh
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
lapsed
immediately
into
sleep
it
was
as
if
she
had
left
him
without
warning
and
without
farewell
to
embark
on
a
private
journey
as
if
having
touched
the
limit
of
love
he
were
left
solitary
to
face
the
darkness
and
the
terrors
of
an
endless
night
the
terrors
were
more
real
than
they
had
ever
been
before
for
so
rich
a
pleasuring
sometime
somehow
a
price
must
be
paid
and
he
knew
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
he
would
be
the
one
to
pay
it
what
he
had
felt
this
night
was
a
springtime
flowering
which
might
never
repeat
itself
because
for
him
it
was
late
summer
late
harvest
with
the
taxman
waiting
at
the
gate
to
claim
his
due
for
chiara
life
was
still
her
debtor
payment
had
been
deferred
too
long
and
her
a
man
on
the
wrong
side
of
forty
the
case
was
far
other
he
knew
where
the
price
tags
were
hidden
he
knew
the
needs
that
followed
the
brisk
satisfaction
of
the
act
of
union
the
need
of
continuity
the
need
of
children
to
be
born
of
the
seed
so
richly
spent
in
lust
or
love
the
need
of
quiet
harbor
and
a
morning
sunlight
after
the
storms
of
the
night
even
as
he
thought
about
it
chiara
stirred
and
turned
toward
him
for
warmth
it
was
a
gesture
made
in
a
dream
but
it
was
more
eloquent
than
words
until
her
marriage
to
calitri
she
had
been
protected
at
every
step
by
rich
and
doting
parents
by
cosseting
nuns
by
the
traditions
of
her
class
when
her
marriage
had
failed
she
had
found
another
refuge
and
now
she
had
come
to
rest
in
his
arms
to
forgetfulness
in
his
practiced
embrace
so
long
as
he
held
her
strongly
and
securely
she
would
stay
but
the
moment
his
grip
slackened
or
his
thing
was
that
she
saw
nothing
one
sided
in
the
bargain
she
had
given
him
her
body
she
had
given
him
her
reputation
what
else
was
there
to
demand
had
he
told
her
she
would
never
have
understood
married
and
the
mother
of
children
she
would
grow
in
the
end
to
maturity
but
in
this
halfway
state
she
would
always
be
the
girl
woman
half
delighted
by
the
adventure
half
afraid
of
its
consequences
but
never
wholly
understanding
that
the
debt
of
love
was
not
all
paid
in
the
coinage
of
the
flesh
for
her
even
tonight
s
encounter
rich
ruinous
and
wonderful
was
a
kind
of
flight
and
he
was
too
old
too
wise
or
too
calculating
to
make
it
with
her
instinctively
he
turned
threw
his
arms
about
her
and
drew
her
to
him
wondering
even
as
he
did
so
why
the
miraculous
oneness
of
the
flesh
should
last
so
short
a
time
and
why
in
the
end
two
lovers
must
lie
so
often
and
so
long
like
across
his
body
her
hair
brushed
his
lips
her
perfume
surrounded
him
but
sleep
would
not
come
and
he
rehearsed
over
and
over
again
their
dinner
table
talk
when
he
had
told
her
of
campeggio
s
advice
and
where
it
might
lead
the
pair
of
them
she
had
listened
attentively
chin
cupped
in
her
hands
her
dark
eyes
bright
with
eagerness
intrigued
by
the
prospect
of
a
plot
of
course
darling
it
s
so
simple
why
did
nt
we
think
of
it
before
there
must
be
twenty
people
in
rome
who
d
be
happy
to
give
evidence
against
corrado
all
we
ve
got
to
do
is
find
them
do
you
know
any
of
them
chiara
not
really
corrado
was
always
fairly
discreet
with
me
still
i
m
sure
if
we
talked
around
we
d
get
a
whole
list
of
names
the
one
thing
we
must
nt
do
he
told
her
firmly
is
talk
around
if
word
finished
do
nt
you
understand
this
is
a
conspiracy
george
darling
do
nt
be
so
melodramatic
all
we
re
trying
to
do
is
get
justice
for
me
you
could
nt
call
that
conspiracy
surely
it
wears
the
color
of
it
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
and
civil
law
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
there
are
only
two
things
we
can
do
employ
a
professional
investigator
or
i
ll
have
to
do
the
investigation
myself
if
we
use
an
investigator
it
will
cost
me
more
money
than
i
can
afford
and
in
the
end
he
could
sell
me
out
to
your
husband
if
i
do
the
job
myself
i
m
immediately
embroiled
up
to
the
neck
she
stared
at
him
wide
eyed
and
innocent
are
you
afraid
george
yes
i
am
of
my
husband
of
his
influence
yes
do
nt
you
want
to
do
but
once
we
re
married
we
have
to
live
if
i
lose
my
reputation
in
rome
i
ca
nt
work
here
any
longer
we
d
have
to
go
back
to
america
i
would
nt
mind
that
besides
what
about
my
reputation
i
did
nt
throw
that
in
your
face
did
i
please
chiara
please
try
to
understand
this
is
nt
a
matter
of
morals
it
s
a
matter
of
authority
professional
status
the
credit
i
live
by
if
i
m
held
up
as
a
common
blackmailer
where
do
i
start
again
this
is
the
double
standard
sweetheart
you
can
sleep
around
as
much
as
you
like
you
can
make
a
million
by
exploiting
the
poor
but
if
you
pass
a
bad
check
for
ten
dollars
or
breach
the
code
of
professional
ethics
you
re
dead
and
buried
and
there
s
no
coming
back
that
s
the
way
the
world
is
rough
as
guts
do
what
you
trip
god
help
you
that
s
what
we
have
to
face
together
if
i
m
not
afraid
george
why
should
you
be
i
ve
got
to
be
sure
was
at
stebbings
and
fanny
met
in
the
drawing
room
for
a
drink
before
dinner
that
always
irked
the
children
they
had
an
aloof
disapproval
but
darrell
liked
to
sit
with
a
whiskey
and
soda
or
a
gin
telling
fanny
about
the
day
or
his
last
journey
and
i
liked
it
too
said
fanny
it
was
adult
a
change
from
those
very
children
then
they
had
dinner
which
gwyneth
used
to
dish
up
for
fanny
after
which
they
waited
on
themselves
it
was
a
three
course
dinner
the
table
properly
laid
with
all
the
panoply
said
to
hugh
and
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
leave
the
table
for
their
private
ploys
no
matter
what
these
were
probably
good
for
them
said
fanny
but
again
it
was
irksome
philippa
chafed
while
some
boy
who
had
called
for
her
sounded
his
horn
outside
you
can
ask
him
to
come
in
and
have
some
coffee
said
darrell
he
does
nt
want
coffee
have
been
sitting
here
an
hour
hugh
had
once
burst
out
a
whole
hour
or
an
hour
and
three
quarters
since
you
started
drinking
and
there
is
an
important
concert
i
need
to
hear
but
darrell
had
forgotten
what
it
felt
like
to
be
young
to
be
passionate
about
things
thought
fanny
can
jazz
be
so
important
he
had
asked
quite
kindly
but
it
was
almost
with
hate
that
hugh
said
this
is
classical
jazz
the
girls
washed
up
or
when
they
were
not
home
fanny
washed
the
silver
and
glass
the
rest
waited
until
the
morning
she
brought
coffee
into
the
drawing
room
darrell
read
the
paper
or
watched
television
while
fanny
watched
too
or
wrote
letters
or
mended
at
ten
o
clock
they
went
tamely
to
bed
usually
to
read
thought
fanny
each
putting
out
their
own
light
with
a
kiss
usually
on
the
cheek
or
forehead
only
now
and
then
something
warmer
again
not
passionate
in
the
world
but
that
october
night
darrell
did
not
settle
down
with
the
paper
did
not
switch
on
a
programme
he
came
over
to
her
and
touched
her
hair
you
re
looking
very
well
tonight
fanny
the
same
as
usual
fanny
tried
to
speak
lightly
presently
she
got
up
and
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
why
go
over
there
i
o
it
s
too
hot
you
feel
beautifully
cool
and
he
asked
is
nt
it
time
for
bed
it
s
only
a
quarter
past
nine
never
mind
why
not
go
when
we
want
to
you
go
i
have
things
to
do
not
now
yes
i
have
to
fanny
got
up
not
now
said
darrell
he
got
up
too
damn
it
all
i
have
been
away
for
weeks
he
put
his
arm
say
fanny
if
we
went
away
just
you
and
i
for
a
few
days
mother
says
you
ought
to
have
a
change
and
i
think
we
deserve
it
this
job
is
brutish
you
have
been
alone
too
long
we
could
go
up
to
town
do
some
shows
or
what
about
madeira
asked
darrell
no
said
fanny
no
but
she
could
not
get
the
words
out
he
bent
his
head
to
kiss
her
again
she
tried
not
to
shrink
but
she
shrank
he
held
her
firmly
closer
darrell
please
do
nt
why
what
s
the
matter
this
thought
fanny
to
herself
is
where
you
use
control
other
women
but
it
was
no
use
thinking
of
other
women
he
was
holding
her
closer
still
and
before
she
could
stop
herself
she
had
cried
out
darrell
please
do
nt
touch
me
do
nt
touch
you
the
again
to
control
herself
this
was
not
darrell
s
fault
and
she
did
not
want
him
to
be
hurt
any
more
than
danny
she
thought
and
caught
herself
back
but
there
was
something
as
simple
and
noble
as
an
animal
about
darrell
not
touch
you
i
m
your
hus
band
she
tried
to
be
still
but
when
that
possessive
hold
tightened
the
panic
came
up
again
i
ca
nt
now
the
struggling
was
growing
frantic
i
ca
nt
perhaps
never
again
what
is
all
this
he
was
still
holding
her
but
now
not
in
his
arms
holding
her
with
his
hands
as
he
felt
her
struggling
fanny
you
are
not
afraid
i
m
your
husband
your
husband
then
help
me
now
fanny
was
clinging
to
him
help
me
help
you
why
how
just
leave
me
for
a
little
while
leave
me
alone
leave
me
then
it
may
be
all
right
what
may
be
all
right
what
s
wrong
do
nt
watch
me
like
that
do
nt
probe
this
is
all
nerves
said
darrell
it
s
not
nerves
darrell
perhaps
i
should
tell
you
but
he
was
too
sure
of
himself
to
listen
he
was
not
angry
he
still
had
not
grasped
what
she
was
trying
though
frantically
to
tell
him
this
is
where
dearest
he
said
you
have
to
let
the
man
know
best
it
s
only
that
somehow
in
the
last
few
months
we
have
lost
one
another
a
little
come
somehow
to
be
almost
strangers
so
he
had
noticed
thought
fanny
it
will
be
all
right
in
a
little
while
said
darrell
no
no
cried
fanny
but
he
turned
her
gently
towards
the
door
and
into
the
hall
i
knew
then
that
i
could
nt
said
fanny
i
had
made
love
with
rob
yes
that
is
what
i
had
made
something
binding
unforgettable
and
private
is
not
a
big
enough
word
a
keep
between
two
people
made
of
minutes
that
last
a
lifetime
until
death
perhaps
past
death
and
for
anyone
else
to
touch
me
was
desecration
it
was
hot
under
the
lavender
sunshade
but
again
fanny
felt
cold
darrell
had
steered
her
to
the
stairs
and
stood
in
the
hall
watching
her
go
up
then
she
heard
him
shutting
up
the
house
in
the
bedroom
she
stayed
still
listening
and
as
cold
as
this
thought
fanny
her
arms
goose
fleshed
but
my
head
and
my
temples
felt
as
if
they
were
in
to
see
shar
on
his
knees
her
loins
his
fingers
were
outstretched
on
her
back
closing
into
fists
in
her
clothing
he
likes
me
he
does
the
girl
cried
hiccuping
in
her
proud
hysteria
he
liked
me
best
all
along
shar
his
eyes
wet
his
face
distorted
pulled
the
girl
over
to
his
unmade
bed
she
was
up
in
that
son
of
a
bitchen
barn
he
said
but
i
had
to
go
back
after
her
she
was
bleeding
she
was
ugly
dirt
on
her
face
on
her
mouth
she
was
ugly
ugly
but
i
i
said
am
i
too
big
for
you
am
i
and
she
did
nt
feel
it
she
was
unconscious
why
did
nt
i
leave
her
there
he
gave
up
on
his
tearing
of
the
girl
s
clothes
and
collapsed
onto
her
suddenly
burying
his
face
against
her
throat
they
could
hear
him
sob
a
bitch
a
filthy
bitch
a
whore
if
mitch
was
able
to
get
shar
away
from
the
girl
though
the
girl
confused
wanted
to
hold
shar
in
her
arms
until
he
makes
sense
again
mitch
knelt
on
the
bed
with
his
hands
on
shar
s
back
as
if
trying
to
brace
shar
s
anguish
for
a
few
minutes
sweating
profusely
mitch
could
not
decide
what
to
do
he
looked
around
marian
stood
crying
pitifully
betrayed
back
against
the
wall
ponzi
stood
in
the
doorway
with
his
hat
askew
and
the
black
feather
curled
up
tight
with
his
astonishment
his
face
had
gone
pale
except
for
his
nose
max
will
know
what
to
do
with
him
mitch
said
hearing
shar
sob
brought
tears
to
his
own
eyes
he
turned
away
and
put
his
arms
around
shar
s
wet
heaving
back
as
if
he
wanted
to
shield
shar
from
the
others
because
of
the
excitement
max
had
his
supper
late
that
evening
around
eight
o
clock
he
had
been
in
a
conversation
with
one
at
his
door
he
opened
it
to
see
with
great
surprise
the
clownish
figure
of
that
man
he
had
had
fired
several
days
before
a
grotesque
young
man
with
filthy
clothes
and
an
imbecile
stare
who
had
reminded
max
uncomfortably
of
a
whimsical
projection
of
himself
jerry
had
begged
for
permission
to
do
something
to
him
first
luring
him
into
the
laundry
room
of
the
motel
out
of
the
sight
and
hearing
of
the
guests
but
max
had
rebuked
him
angrily
for
you
it
s
a
job
for
us
with
responsibility
it
s
a
life
a
man
s
life
his
defense
of
ponzi
irritated
him
since
it
placed
him
on
ponzi
s
side
and
seemed
to
establish
a
peculiar
relationship
between
them
i
am
growing
weary
of
this
life
max
said
there
are
few
things
that
delight
me
shar
he
is
a
delight
but
what
is
happening
to
shar
when
they
arrived
at
shar
s
room
everything
was
quiet
inside
shar
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
ferocious
wind
had
tunneled
through
it
briefly
and
disappeared
mitchie
came
out
of
the
bathroom
with
a
wet
towel
which
shar
accepted
and
held
against
his
forehead
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here
said
shar
is
something
wrong
max
sat
down
shakily
beside
shar
his
heart
was
pounding
his
breathing
came
with
difficulty
he
met
shar
s
cold
stare
with
compassion
the
flurry
of
his
thoughts
his
fears
was
quieted
by
the
admiration
he
felt
for
shar
s
inhuman
control
of
himself
max
could
smell
shar
s
breath
and
he
could
see
the
strain
in
his
face
you
will
never
let
me
help
you
max
said
putting
a
hand
on
shar
s
arm
it
was
a
curiously
kind
gesture
there
s
nothing
to
help
shar
said
he
smoked
his
cigarette
what
the
hell
do
you
want
you
runty
bastard
he
said
to
jerry
are
you
going
to
wave
that
pistol
around
here
you
bastardly
little
coward
i
knew
you
would
nt
you
ca
nt
do
everything
with
a
pistol
jerry
laughed
shortly
and
went
out
into
the
hall
a
man
should
never
make
enemies
max
said
no
man
is
protected
from
his
enemies
what
the
hell
do
i
want
protection
from
shar
said
what
can
hurt
me
what
can
they
do
to
me
that
i
would
nt
want
done
enemies
he
put
the
towel
to
his
eyes
and
sucked
a
long
shuddering
breath
i
do
nt
know
what
the
hell
you
re
worried
about
i
ll
do
the
race
for
you
if
you
do
nt
want
me
you
can
put
mitch
in
mitch
is
good
i
d
stake
my
life
on
him
he
s
a
good
man
but
i
want
to
do
the
race
i
ca
nt
stand
it
until
the
race
this
is
the
worst
waiting
time
i
ve
had
the
time
wo
nt
move
it
drags
along
get
in
there
that
s
very
good
to
hear
max
said
happily
vanilla
jones
shar
said
he
looked
at
max
they
smiled
together
i
ll
run
it
straight
this
time
no
accidents
i
d
run
it
backwards
if
i
could
do
it
today
i
ve
got
a
hell
of
a
long
time
yet
to
wait
tomorrow
you
can
take
it
easy
do
nt
go
out
tomorrow
and
do
nt
drink
let
me
take
care
of
you
you
are
not
imprisoned
in
a
body
like
mine
you
do
nt
feel
the
weight
of
your
own
guts
pulling
at
your
heart
you
do
nt
understand
that
i
need
you
you
will
take
care
of
yourself
shar
stared
at
him
there
was
a
clumsy
silence
as
if
shar
did
not
want
to
answer
yes
he
said
finally
max
leaned
forward
in
his
seriousness
you
will
do
it
for
me
you
will
live
it
for
me
you
wo
you
shar
said
max
sighed
and
got
to
his
feet
he
wiped
his
pale
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
shar
i
know
the
price
you
pay
for
your
self
control
i
am
sensitive
of
your
skill
i
am
sensitive
of
your
being
i
understand
you
you
can
rely
on
me
valuable
trick
of
looking
a
person
straight
in
the
eyes
until
those
eyes
fell
kara
storm
s
eyes
revealed
there
in
the
brightly
lighted
boathouse
were
a
pale
violet
intense
incredible
his
were
the
first
to
fall
she
gave
a
little
laugh
and
turned
taking
philip
s
arm
and
leading
the
way
outdoors
the
scene
as
he
relived
it
now
was
etched
indelibly
on
his
brain
should
he
have
known
that
this
was
no
washington
society
matron
but
a
plotter
direct
from
the
house
of
borgia
no
he
did
not
think
that
even
john
arkwright
would
have
scolded
him
for
misinterpreting
her
and
surely
in
his
habitual
ivory
tower
he
could
not
be
expected
to
know
that
however
corny
this
type
might
seem
in
a
cloak
and
dagger
mystery
here
in
real
life
the
communists
would
necessarily
resort
to
it
we
americans
would
be
impressed
by
nothing
else
captive
as
we
are
to
television
and
who
should
know
this
better
than
our
enemies
he
had
never
seen
anyone
like
her
in
his
narrow
world
from
the
top
of
her
sleek
head
to
her
remarkably
small
feet
red
toenails
in
sandals
in
october
she
was
a
new
phenomenon
to
him
he
thought
of
miss
burton
and
wished
that
he
had
her
by
him
to
tell
him
what
to
do
as
if
she
herself
would
have
known
the
storms
led
him
up
a
winding
path
to
what
philip
humorously
announced
as
the
camp
the
grounds
were
ablaze
with
lights
nestled
comfortably
among
a
stand
of
pines
and
spruce
the
building
reminded
sam
of
the
luxurious
hunting
lodges
he
had
heard
that
new
york
financiers
maintained
in
the
adirondacks
it
was
long
and
rangy
with
a
studied
roughness
of
exterior
and
sat
in
grounds
beautifully
kept
in
their
casualness
this
was
he
supposed
an
expression
of
kara
s
personality
he
felt
that
storm
himself
would
not
have
bothered
rafted
living
room
straight
out
of
an
architectural
magazine
there
were
wicker
lounging
chairs
everywhere
expensive
rugs
cushions
strewn
about
the
floor
in
oriental
fashion
a
massive
fireplace
of
imported
pink
limestone
blocks
was
topped
by
a
huge
monolith
of
some
smooth
dark
rock
into
the
face
of
which
a
single
ceramic
tile
had
been
cemented
blazoned
with
a
coat
of
arms
of
yellow
and
blue
there
was
an
ineffable
sense
of
expensive
repose
here
these
were
aristocrats
of
the
old
world
the
room
insisted
who
fled
occasionally
to
the
maine
wilderness
to
rest
from
their
exploits
charles
remained
by
the
door
obediently
holding
sam
s
bag
there
seemed
no
doubt
that
as
far
as
mrs
storm
was
concerned
he
was
a
menial
you
would
like
to
freshen
up
i
think
dr
bowden
she
told
sam
crisply
and
led
the
way
to
a
bedroom
at
the
end
of
a
long
paneled
hall
it
was
an
apartment
as
sumptuous
as
the
rest
of
the
house
complete
the
bag
and
followed
his
mistress
out
sam
wondered
as
he
opened
the
bag
if
he
had
brought
the
wrong
clothes
from
the
inn
he
had
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
for
a
social
week
he
changed
into
the
best
he
had
a
pair
of
reasonably
well
pressed
slacks
and
a
clean
shirt
and
sallied
forth
on
his
return
to
the
living
room
he
realized
that
he
need
not
have
been
so
careful
storm
had
donned
an
enormous
pair
of
dirty
green
cotton
pants
and
a
turtle
neck
sweater
kara
still
immaculate
stood
out
in
sharp
contrast
to
him
sam
felt
an
invisible
barrier
between
the
two
to
his
surprise
charles
joined
them
correct
and
military
in
his
handsome
pilot
s
uniform
he
was
not
a
servant
then
after
all
as
they
stood
chatting
for
a
moment
before
the
crackling
fire
two
siamese
cats
marched
solemnly
into
the
room
they
came
with
the
air
of
a
royal
guard
the
larger
and
plainer
slightly
behind
the
other
sam
them
in
admiration
this
was
in
deed
a
day
of
surprises
the
cats
ignored
him
and
came
to
a
halt
before
their
mistress
sat
and
stared
up
at
her
unblinkingly
darlings
she
cried
thank
you
she
turned
to
sam
the
kittens
are
announcing
dinner
she
explained
the
cats
reversed
themselves
and
proceeded
slowly
toward
the
dining
room
she
stood
looking
at
the
scientist
expectantly
just
barely
remembering
what
to
do
he
offered
his
arm
and
they
followed
the
cats
in
at
the
entrance
kara
disengaged
her
hand
and
clapped
sharply
nikita
fey
off
to
your
reward
the
two
animals
still
in
perfect
formation
made
an
oblique
turn
and
marched
away
without
a
backward
glance
it
was
an
exhibition
as
unexplainable
to
him
as
she
was
herself
do
nt
you
think
they
are
well
trained
dr
bowden
she
smiled
and
he
realized
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
an
expression
of
her
own
superior
personality
many
intelligent
creatures
can
be
conditioned
to
execute
orders
she
went
on
even
to
the
death
if
one
has
the
power
to
command
them
a
remark
he
thought
afterward
oddly
suggestive
of
what
was
to
come
the
dinner
competently
served
by
a
stolid
foreign
woman
who
was
wordless
went
off
smoothly
and
sam
as
much
as
possible
let
the
others
do
the
talking
storm
and
charles
did
most
of
it
recounting
the
details
of
their
meeting
at
keezar
lake
by
the
end
of
the
meal
which
he
did
nt
really
want
sam
had
begun
to
entertain
a
disquieting
thought
mrs
storm
must
have
known
that
he
was
going
to
be
there
but
he
carefully
said
nothing
of
this
thinking
that
he
must
have
misinterpreted
them
he
was
glad
when
dinner
was
over
and
he
was
permitted
to
turn
in
we
ll
want
to
get
an
early
start
on
the
lake
his
host
explained
and
his
hostess
bid
him
a
cordial
good
night
on
end
they
sailed
he
and
storm
the
wind
held
in
the
north
west
and
the
viking
outdistanced
him
on
every
pass
beating
him
in
every
race
unmercifully
the
more
the
icelander
won
the
more
carl
s
last
class
was
at
three
good
i
ll
arrange
an
appointment
for
three
thirty
he
wrote
the
time
on
a
pad
then
carefully
arranged
the
pencil
on
top
of
the
pad
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
carl
broke
the
silence
i
shall
not
be
able
to
register
for
my
last
year
sir
without
a
tuition
and
textbook
loan
tell
me
do
you
sir
you
were
married
in
the
state
i
take
it
your
child
will
be
born
in
the
state
of
course
and
i
ll
cast
my
first
vote
in
this
state
i
ll
be
twenty
one
the
latter
part
of
next
month
good
i
believe

as
a
state
resident
this
is
a
state
university
i
like
to
believe
we
take
care
of
our
own
tuition
fees
are
lower
for
state
residents
and
i
am
certain
a
loan
can
be
arranged
three
per
cent
interest
and
ten
years
to
pay
carl
s
sudden
relief
made
him
almost
incoherent
in
thanking
the
dean
he
thanked
him
for
putting
him
on
his
list
for
the
cottage
the
doctor
the
loan
for
annie
s
class
the
dean
frowned
and
raised
his
hand
in
a
stop
signal
i
m
told
he
said
that
annie
is
a
great
asset
to
the
class
in
playwriting
i
hope
she
will
be
able
to
said
carl
i
am
pleased
to
know
that
too
bad
she
can
not
forge
ahead
she
seems
to
have
so
many
potentialities
for
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
good
luck
carl
he
said
abruptly
he
picked
up
the
telephone
carl
was
dismissed
carl
chain
smoked
in
the
waiting
room
while
dr
marson
gave
annie
the
preliminary
examination
lungs
heart
blood
pressure
reflexes
and
so
on
when
he
had
finished
the
nurse
took
annie
into
a
cool
cubicle
had
her
undress
and
helped
her
onto
the
table
she
draped
a
sheet
over
annie
s
nakedness
told
her
to
relax
and
left
saying
the
doctor
would
see
her
in
a
few
minutes
annie
had
never
had
a
complete
physical
examination
in
fact
she
had
never
been
to
a
doctor
except
for
something
trivial
a
cinder
in
her
eye
a
wart
to
be
removed
a
vaccination
and
other
minor
things
she
had
never
been
examined
while
naked
she
was
followed
by
the
nurse
now
mrs
brown
he
said
cheerfully
let
s
see
you
slide
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
table
with
your
knees
raised
that
s
it
all
the
way
now
that
s
good
now
put
your
feet
in
the
stirrups
annie
did
nt
know
where
the
stirrups
were
or
what
they
were
for
that
matter
the
nurse
guided
her
feet
into
the
stirrups
suddenly
the
doctor
threw
back
the
sheet
and
spread
her
legs
wide
apart
no
annie
cried
out
no
do
nt
she
put
her
legs
together
and
slid
back
up
the
table
clutching
the
sheet
about
her
now
mrs
brown
now
said
the
doctor
soothingly
maybe
she
ll
be
more
relaxed
with
her
husband
here
said
the
nurse
i
ll
get
him
do
nt
get
him
please
said
annie
she
did
not
want
carl
to
see
her
the
doctor
says
she
assumed
the
position
that
s
a
good
girl
said
the
doctor
the
nurse
handed
him
an
instrument
annie
flinched
at
the
first
impact
of
the
cold
instrument
on
her
inner
flesh
i
know
it
s
a
position
of
great
indignity
said
the
doctor
but
it
s
necessary
indignity
it
was
a
new
word
to
annie
it
sounds
exactly
like
what
it
means
thought
annie
soon
it
was
over
and
the
doctor
left
the
nurse
helped
her
off
the
table
there
that
was
nt
too
bad
now
was
it
said
the
nurse
no
lied
annie
doctor
wants
to
see
you
and
your
husband
in
his
office
when
you
ve
finished
dressing
carl
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
corridor
mutely
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
tight
as
they
went
into
the
office
your
wife
is
in
her
third
month
of
pregnancy
said
the
doctor
cheerfully
nothing
to
worry
about
there
annie
was
alerted
at
the
word
there
of
course
she
has
a
very
narrow
pelvis
annie
felt
a
quiver
of
fear
but
i
do
nt
think
that
will
give
us
too
much
trouble
he
gave
instructions
check
with
the
dentist
lots
of
milk
for
calcium
that
the
baby
takes
away
from
a
mother
do
everything
she
was
accustomed
to
doing
but
at
the
first
sign
of
exhaustion
lie
down
and
rest
diet
as
usual
but
avoid
fattening
foods
we
want
a
small
baby
he
said
again
annie
felt
that
quiver
of
fear
carl
asked
his
fee
my
fee
mr
brown
fifty
dollars
the
doctor
saw
annie
and
carl
exchange
looks
but
do
nt
worry
about
it
pay
as
we
go
along
or
take
a
year
i
can
wait
how
much
for
the
hospital
asked
carl
private
a
gasping
sound
however
i
prefer
my
patients
to
go
to
the
university
hospital
that
ten
dollars
a
day
too
asked
annie
no
charge
except
for
anesthetics

more
at
home
though
doctor
if
you
d
call
me
annie
annie
it
is
then
he
said
i
ll
my
own
wrist
watch
was
stopped
i
had
forgotten
to
wind
it
it
must
have
been
about
four
o
clock
since
it
was
still
early
spring
dawn
was
fairly
late
some
of
the
farmhouses
i
passed
had
lights
in
them
if
the
house
was
very
close
to
the
road
i
could
catch
a
whiff
of
frying
through
the
small
crack
of
my
open
window
then
those
houses
ended
and
the
road
swung
directly
south
through
empty
lumbering
country
there
was
no
traffic
no
house
lights
there
was
nt
anything
except
a
stretch
of
concrete
and
stands
of
timber
there
was
just
a
black
pre
dawn
sky
and
two
jabs
of
my
headlights
the
friendly
glow
of
the
dashboard
and
the
vibration
of
the
heavy
engine
straining
slightly
as
i
climbed
hills
without
lessening
speed
i
ve
always
liked
to
drive
alone
at
night
there
is
a
sentimental
brightness
to
things
it
s
a
good
deal
like
being
drunk
i
always
see
the
world
perfectly
then
see
it
in
all
its
great
pathetic
clarity
i
become
invincible
beyond
life
and
death
with
the
hum
of
wheels
under
me
i
can
love
the
human
race
as
i
never
can
at
any
otherptime
i
can
think
great
cloudy
thoughts
and
tremble
with
the
power
have
a
dozen
children
and
live
forever
it
seems
possible
i
drove
very
fast
i
knew
as
everyone
else
did
that
the
highway
patrols
went
home
at
three
and
did
nt
come
back
until
seven
i
was
making
very
good
time
the
grades
got
steeper
and
i
had
to
push
a
little
on
the
accelerator
to
maintain
speed
i
was
crossing
the
ridge
of
hills
that
separated
the
great
central
valley
from
the
smaller
providence
valley
the
providence
river
was
the
one
you
saw
from
the
front
of
our
house
the
one
that
the
first
william
howland
had
followed
when
he
was
looking
for
a
place
to
settle
the
one
he
had
named
for
his
mother
i
did
nt
believe
i
could
have
gotten
here
so
fast
i
slowed
and
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
pine
trees
neat
rows
neat
fences
then
a
lumber
road
i
slowed
even
more
and
read
the
small
identifying
sign
it
was
the
eastman
halsey
tract
i
was
three
quarters
of
the
way
home
i
closed
had
come
i
really
should
have
looked
at
the
speedometer
john
would
be
furious
if
he
ever
found
out
but
i
did
nt
slow
down
i
came
out
of
the
mountain
ridges
and
zoomed
down
the
straight
level
road
through
madison
city
the
courthouse
street
lights
burning
at
each
of
its
four
corners
post
office
street
lights
broken
in
front
of
it
john
s
office
shuttered
and
empty
and
how
does
the
roll
top
desk
look
in
there
teetering
on
its
too
thin
legs
in
the
dark
i
startled
a
pack
of
dogs
rooting
in
the
garbage
pails
in
front
of
the
happy
chicken
cafe
they
bolted
for
the
shadows
yelping
i
passed
joe
s
place
on
the
outskirts
of
town
closed
and
dark
except
for
the
string
of
small
lights
burning
in
its
parking
lot
just
then
the
radio
went
off
very
suddenly
without
static
without
any
warning
its
sound
stopped
the
lights
still
burned
and
i
pushed
all
the
buttons
and
worked
the
a
new
car
and
it
was
very
annoying
i
do
not
like
to
drive
alone
without
a
radio
what
had
been
fun
turns
into
something
mildly
threatening
the
dark
which
had
been
filled
with
the
pleasant
empty
headed
chatter
of
the
machine
closed
back
and
this
time
it
was
filled
with
its
own
sounds
not
with
yours
the
sounds
of
empty
country
and
empty
roads
depressing
a
little
frightening
i
was
happy
that
i
was
almost
home
and
that
dawn
was
almost
breaking
the
sky
was
already
lightening
you
could
see
that
the
day
would
be
overcast
at
least
until
the
ground
fog
rose
and
burned
away
i
came
to
the
bend
at
thatcher
s
creek
and
slowed
down
no
more
than
a
mile
now
i
should
see
the
house
at
the
next
turn
the
sky
was
silvery
colored
fish
colored
the
color
of
a
swamp
cat
the
wild
azaleas
were
blooming
i
had
nt
realized
how
many
of
them
there
were
their
sweet
wet
perfume
slipped
through
the
crack
of
wet
i
felt
the
wheels
skid
once
slightly
i
slowed
down
still
more
this
valley
often
had
fogs
when
the
higher
drier
mountains
had
none
the
road
curved
up
to
our
pastures
edged
by
a
barbed
wire
fence
covered
with
tight
pink
sweetheart
roses
not
yet
in
bloom
and
then
i
came
to
the
last
turn
and
looked
up
the
slope
of
ground
toward
the
house
somehow
i
had
gotten
the
idea
that
it
would
not
be
there
would
have
disappeared
like
a
ghost
damn
that
radio
i
thought
but
of
course
it
was
there
vague
and
indistinct
in
the
fog
but
there
just
the
way
it
had
been
for
the
last
five
generations
it
looked
very
very
large
in
this
light
and
empty
fog
covered
the
fields
beneath
it
so
that
it
seemed
to
float
without
solid
ground
just
exactly
like
those
fairy
castles
in
a
child
s
story
book
i
turned
in
the
drive
through
the
great
mass
of
azaleas
john
had
planted
these
were
nt
quite
in
bloom
their
wet
leaves
shone
black
in
the
fog
i
drove
faster
the
gravel
rattling
off
my
tires
until
i
came
to
the
end
and
there
was
the
yard
familiar
and
safe
stretching
in
front
of
me
full
of
known
things
a
power
mower
forgotten
and
left
out
overnight
a
rake
leaning
against
the
house
a
bicycle
empty
clothes
lines
cords
frayed
and
fluttering
pat
that
moment
the
radio
went
on
again
very
loud
i
listened
for
a
minute
then
switched
it
off
as
i
walked
to
the
kitchen
door
pulling
the
key
from
my
purse
shivering
a
little
in
the
morning
chill
i
began
to
wonder
and
the
more
i
thought
the
much
i
have
nt
knitted
it
yet
papa
thank
you
for
planning
to
knit
it
oh
now
where
shall
we
go
oh
let
s
just
walk
papa
is
that
all
right
i
love
to
walk
it
ll
make
my
legs
strong
your
legs
are
strong
i
ca
nt
wait
to
get
my
ballet
shoes
that
may
be
entirely
a
matter
of
time
and
you
just
ca
nt
rush
time
you
ve
got
to
nt
wait
i
want
to
put
on
my
ballet
shoes
and
dance
the
way
i
ve
seen
madame
totovskaya
dance
she
s
old
but
she
s
still
very
light
and
when
she
dances
the
way
she
used
to
in
ballet
it
s
very
beautiful
she
must
be
fifty
is
that
so
i
think
so
she
talks
about
dancing
long
ago
i
ca
nt
wait
to
meet
her
you
ll
like
her
she
s
like
a
little
girl
how
many
of
you
are
there
sometimes
six
sometimes
five
but
sometimes
i
m
the
only
one
there
i
have
nt
missed
one
class
yet
and
all
the
others
have
madame
totovskaya
gives
me
my
lesson
for
a
whole
hour
just
the
same
i
like
her
she
s
really
nice
but
when
we
do
something
wrong
oh
boy
watch
out
what
happens
she
stops
the
s
an
old
man
i
guess
he
s
even
older
than
you
are
papa
then
she
just
looks
at
whoever
s
done
something
wrong
and
she
just
waits
then
she
does
the
movement
herself
the
way
it
ought
to
be
done
then
she
nods
at
her
nephew
michael
he
starts
playing
again
and
we
start
practicing
again
i
m
not
old
rosey
giggled
oh

they
walked
on
down
fifth
avenue
he
thought
i
hope
i
m
permitted
to
remember
this
moment
some
day
the
way
i
ve
been
remembering
the
poppy
field
lately
when
they
came
to
the
plaza
he
thought
i
ll

rosey
to

they
went
in
and
of
twelve
or
thirteen
rose
he
said
this
is
my
friend
zak
avakian
zak
i
d
like
you
to
meet
my
daughter
rose
zak
stood
dumbfounded
a
moment
looking
at
the
little
girl
and
then
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
between
both
of
his
hands
as
rosey
curtsied
my
dear
young
lady
zak
said

is

an
honor
i
saw
you
once
years
ago
in
san
francisco

beautiful

he
then
put
his
arm
around
the
boy
and
said
rose

my
son
juan
the
boy
held
out
his
hand
the
little
girl
took
it
and
curtsied
again
what

zak
said
i
was
about
to
take
juan
to
the
ball
game
and
now
all
of
us
can
go
together
but
let
s
have
some
lunch
first
they
went
into
the
dining
room
to
the
same
into
her
chair
as
zak
watched
they
ordered
and
then
zak
said
well
now
i
m
not
a
drinker
but
this
is
a
special
occasion
so
i
m
going
to
have
a
drink
he
turned
to
the
waiter
and
asked
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
the
waiter
went
off
and
zak
said
they
launch
new
ships

a
bottle
of
champagne

nt
they
well
i
want
to

too
a

the
same
month
of
the
same
year

up
together
he
put
his
arm
around
juan
and
squeezed
the
boy
looked
from
zak
to
yep
to
rosey
the
waiter
came
with
the
bottle
and
zak
asked
him
to
fill
the
two
glasses
he
did
so
and
went
off
zak
drank
his
glass
dry
said
the
food
came
and
they
ate
when
the
waiter
placed
the
tab
on
the
table
yep
took
it
quickly
but
zak
snatched
it
out
of
his
hand
oh

the
first
food
i
ve
had
with

son

with

he
brought
out
his
wallet
removed
a
one
hundred
dollar
bill
and
handed
it
to
the
waiter
juan
he
said

me

the
boy
brought
a
wallet
out
of
his
jacket
pocket
what
have
you
got
in
here
the
boy
blushed
may
i
look
okay
zak
poked
his
short
stubby
fingers
into
the
various
compartments
of
the
wallet
in
one
he
found
a
snapshot
which
he
glanced
at
and
then
handed
to
yep
zak
and
a
dark
young
woman
both
smiling
my
father
and
my
mother
juan
said
softly
they
separated
when
again
and
so
did
my
father
this
is
the
first
time
i
ve
seen
my
father
is
your
father
like
what
you
thought
he
d
be
no
sir
no
sir
zak
said
am
i
as
big
a
disappointment
as
all
that
no
sir
the
boy
said
again
yep
noticed
zak
s
eyes
he
filled
zak
s
glass
and
zak
drank
quickly
he
did
nt
empty
the
glass
this
time
though
he
took
a
sip
straightened
pins
and
matches
and
belts
and
shoelaces
and
dirty
looks
will
ellis
beat
the
naked
witness
in
a
locked
seclusion
room
deborah
slid
down
the
wall
to
an
accustomed
place
on
the
floor
among
the
other
statues
watching
the
pictures
in
her
mind
simple
pictures
explicit
and
terrifying
in
the
evening
lucia
a
new
patient
with
a
certain
prestige
for
her
violence
and
the
nine
years
she
had
spent
in
one
of
the
roughest
hospitals
in
the
country
suddenly
said
to
the
small
group
of
perpetually
cold
ones
who
were
huddled
around
the
radiator
enclosure
it
s
different
here
i
been
lotsa
lotsa
wards
what
s
here
there
s
more
scared
more
mad
pissin
on
the
floor
and
yellin
but
it
s
because
of
the
maybe
it
s
because
of
the
little
little
maybe
she
went
off
again
leaping
in
her
long
ostrich
run
down
the
hall
laughing
in
order
to
negate
the
immense
fearful
power
of
her
words
but
they
had
been
given
and
they
were
hanging
in
the
air
like
the
zoo
smell
of
the
ward
itself
everyone
was
afraid
of
the
hope
the
little
little
maybe
but
for
deborah
coming
at
that
moment
the
words
had
a
special
ring
so
that
she
looked
out
into
both
worlds
and
saw
the
imminent
things
the
lowering
cloud
and
the
worms
that
were
dropping
from
it
and
the
law
blowing
like
a
shred
in
the
black
wind
never
mind
the
maybe
it
s
an
administrative
problem
pesther
and
jacob
sat
together
in
the
office
waiting
dr
fried
saw
for
reassurance
that
she
was
not
god
there
were
no
sure
promises
and
she
could
not
be
a
judge
of
what
they
had
done
or
not
done
to
their
daughter
to
bring
her
to
this
battlefield
is
it
wrong
to
want
a
child
like
anyone
else
s
jacob
asked
i
i
mean
is
there
a
cure
really
or
will
she
stay
here
and
have
to
be
placated
and
comforted
always
he
heard
how
cold
his
words
sounded
it
is
nt
a
question
of
love
sick
or
well
it
s
only
that
we
have
to
expect
something
even
to
hope
for
something
can
you
tell
us
what
we
may
hope
for
if
you
want
to
hope
for
a
college
diploma
and
a
box
of
dance
invitations
and
pressed
roses
and
a
nice
clean
cut
young
man
from
a
fine
family
i
do
nt
know
this
is
what
most
parents
hope
for
i
do
nt
know
if
deborah
will
have
these
things
someday
or
if
she
will
even
find
out
and
come
to
terms
with
what
she
really
does
want
may
we
see
her
dr
fried
had
known
that
the
question
would
come
and
here
it
was
it
was
the
one
she
did
nt
want
to
answer
of
course
if
you
decide
to
see
her
you
may
but
i
would
not
advise
it
this
time
she
tried
to
make
the
answer
very
very
calm
why
not
jacob
said
moving
loudly
against
his
fear
because
her
feeling
of
reality
is
quite
shaky
now
the
way
she
looks
might
alarm
you
a
little
and
she
knows
this
and
is
afraid
for
you
and
for
herself
also
jacob
sat
back
dazedly
wondering
why
they
had
ever
done
this
thing
the
old
deborah
as
she
was
might
have
been
sick
as
they
all
said
she
had
been
unsure
and
wretched
but
she
had
been
theirs
unsure
to
be
guarded
and
planned
for
wretched
to
be
cheered
and
the
picture
that
this
doctor
made
was
of
someone
unrecognizable
let
me
say
that
the
symptoms
are
not
the
sickness
the
doctor
was
saying
these
symptoms
are
defenses
and
shields
believe
it
or
not
her
sickness
is
the
only
solid
ground
she
has
she
and
i
are
hacking
away
at
that
ground
on
which
she
stands
that
there
will
be
another
firmer
ground
for
her
after
this
is
destroyed
she
can
only
take
on
faith
imagine
it
for
yourself
for
a
moment
and
you
can
see
why
she
does
nt
pay
attention
to
her
grooming
why
she
gets
so
frightened
and
the
symptoms
proliferate
dr
fried
tried
to
describe
the
feelings
of
someone
who
had
never
known
real
mental
health
in
her
life
we
who
have
never
experienced
this
sickness
firsthand
can
only
guess
what
horror
and
loneliness
there
must
be
you
know
she
is
now
being
called
upon
to
suspend
all
the
years
of
what
she
has
known
as
reality
and
to
take
another
version
of
the
world
on
faith
health
the
world
we
gave
her
was
nt
so
horrible
jacob
said
but
she
never
took
your
world
at
all
do
nt
you
see
she
created
a
robot
that
went
through
the
motions
of
reality
and
behind
it
the
true
person
drew
further
and
further
away
knowing
that
people
feared
the
unknown
person
behind
the
familiar
robot
she
let
the
matter
rest
jacob
said
quietly
i
still
want
to
see
her
no
jacob
it
s
better
es
i
want
to
see
her
it
s
my
right
very
well
the
doctor
said
affably
i
ll
call
and
have
her
brought
down
from
the
ward
and
you
may
see
her
in
the
visitors
room
she
went
to
her
phone
if
you
should
want
to
see
me
again
afterward
please
have
the
attendant
on
duty
call
me
i
will
be
here
until
four
she
watched
them
leave
and
walk
rigidly
toward
they
say
make
her
well
they
say
with
good
table
manners
and
a
future
according
to
our
agreed
on
dream
she
sighed
even
the
intelligent
the
honest
the
good
find
it
too
easy
to
sell
their
children
deceits
and
vanities
and
arrogances
that
they
would
never
stoop
to
for
themselves
they
perpetrate
on
their
children
ach
another
sigh
escaped
from
her
because
she
had
never
given
birth
or
nursed
a
child
and
because
she
wondered
suddenly
if
she
too
would
not
connive
or
be
ambitious
buy
dreams
and
wish
them
impossibly
on
a
deborah
if
the
deborah
were
her
own
she
thought
come
on
he
roared
let
s
go
motioning
for
the
chubby
luther
to
perform
the
painful
role
of
the
girl
candy
now
sidney
maybe
we
d
better
not
get
started
again
luther
observed
apprehensively
you
know
the
doctor
just
told
you
to
take
it
easy
come
on
uncle
jack
bellowed
and
whether
he
was
furious
simply
part
of
the
dance
he
stalked
up
to
his
brother
inlaw
and
slapped
him
smartly
in
the
face
this
was
too
much
for
ida
who
finally
passed
to
the
attack
and
began
pushing
uncle
jack
vigorously
toward
his
bed
hands
off
he
shouted
in
astonished
protest
hands
off
you
sow
i
ca
nt
stand
another
minute
of
this
candy
thought
good
grief
and
she
rushed
blindly
out
of
the
room
to
find
help
she
flew
down
the
hall
and
with
a
little
sob
of
despair
flung
open
the
first
door
she
came
to
but
was
startled
to
find
herself
again
in
the
service
room
full
of
mops
and
buckets
where
she
d
made
the
acquaintance
of
irving
krankeit
s
mother
it
seemed
impossible
she
could
have
sworn
that
the
tiny
room
was
whole
floors
and
corridors
distant
tucked
away
in
some
obscure
corner
of
the
colossal
building
had
nt
it
taken
her
ten
minutes
to
find
her
way
back
from
it
to
daddy
s
room
of
detergent
yes
there
was
the
little
sliding
panel
it
was
still
partially
open
and
as
she
looked
she
heard
someone
in
the
amphitheater
say
something
that
sounded
like
ping
candy
had
an
almost
physical
premonition
warning
her
not
to
look
but
some
still
louder
inner
force
candy
fiercely
compelled
her
to
peer
into
the
vastness
below
chiang
aunt
livia
naked
unconscious
attached
by
the
wrists
to
the
vertical
operating
table
looked
like
a
handsome
animal
offered
for
sacrifice
seated
immediately
behind
her
was
krankeit
the
young
doctor
sat
silently
as
if
meditating
on
the
form
before
him
then
he
took
something
from
a
table
at
his
side
leaned
forward
and
inserted
it
in
livia
s
girlish
right
buttock
moo
he
said
distinctly
settling
back
into
his
seat
this
was
krankeit
s
ancient
chinese
therapy
candy
thought
with
a
tinge
of
reverence
these
were
the
chinese
pins
with
which
he
had
treated
her
that
he
was
now
sticking
in
livia
candy
suddenly
felt
very
tired
and
beyond
the
fatigue
was
an
aching
uneasiness
which
was
nt
due
solely
to
her
resentment
at
seeing
livia
occupy
her
place
on
the
tilting
table
i
feel
as
if
something
were
coming
to
an
end
she
thought
my
childhood
perhaps
tch
ou
krankeit
said
and
sat
back
in
a
minute
though
he
was
forward
again
with
another
pin
back
and
forth
he
went
like
someone
giving
artificial
respiration
very
slowly
and
the
pins
grew
into
clusters
like
two
little
bouquets
one
on
each
of
livia
s
handsome
tushy
moung
how
defenseless
aunt
livia
looked
strapped
to
the
table
naked
and
unconscious
and
a
few
hours
ago
it
had
been
her
of
course
krankeit
was
a
doctor
candy
reflected
but
he
was
also
a
man
and
livia
was
beautiful
it
seemed
so
unfair
somehow
and
things
and
rush
into
the
amphitheater
ping
oh
i
just
wish
that
it
would
stop
happening
she
thought
cross
and
weary
i
just
wish
i
were
someplace
else
meeow
there
was
a
note
of
tense
excitement
in
krankeit
s
voice
now
which
grew
stronger
with
each
pin
someplace
far
from
racine
i
m
tired
of
that
darn
old
college
too
fu
krankeit
cried
feng
jao
putting
in
three
pins
in
quick
succession
i
do
nt
care
candy
said
to
herself
i
do
nt
want
to
see
aunt
livia
anymore
or
dr
krankeit
either
wowee
one
of
krankeit
s
hands
candy
noticed
was
briskly
engaged
in
his
lap
why
why
he
s
abusing
himself
she
thought
her
eyebrows
shooting
up
at
that
precise
moment
she
thought
of
new
york
city
and
decided
to
go
there
yelled
someplace
where
she
knew
no
one
and
where
no
one
knew
her
pow
fang
dang
pow
krankeit
screamed
triumphantly
dropping
forward
from
his
chair
to
lie
utterly
spent
face
down
and
apparently
unconscious
on
the
floor
of
the
great
amphitheater
where
she
could
lose
the
old
candy
in
the
nameless
city
streets
she
thought
where
she
could
finally
be
herself
there
was
only
one
tree
on
grove
street
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
candy
was
quick
to
notice
and
to
love
look
she
would
say
softly
squeezing
someone
s
hand
is
nt
it
too
much
i
could
just
hug
myself
every
time
i
pass
it
and
that
was
where
she
met
the
hunchback
it
was
late
one
airless
summer
day
when
the
sky
over
greenwich
village
was
the
color
of
lead
it
had
just
begun
to
rain
and
candy
was
standing
back
in
a
shallow
doorway
waiting
for
her
bus
dreamily
joyful
in
her
new
mandarin
rain
cloak
hugging
it
to
her
she
saw
him
he
was
out
in
the
midst
of
the
downpour
leaning
against
the
tree
staring
into
the
window
display
of
the
men
s
shop
on
the
corner
he
was
standing
very
still
though
from
time
to
time
there
seemed
to
be
a
slight
movement
of
his
back
as
if
he
might
be
consciously
pressing
his
hump
against
the
tree
candy
s
humming
softened
as
she
watched
him
and
her
heart
beat
a
little
faster
oh
the
fullness
of
it
she
thought
the
terrible
beautiful
fullness
of
life
and
a
great
mass
of
feeling
rose
in
her
throat
at
the
pity
she
felt
for
her
father
so
shut
away
from
it
all
never
to
know
life
never
even
to
suspect
what
it
was
all
about
she
put
her
arms
around
her
delightful
body
and
hugged
herself
so
glad
at
being
alive
really
alive
and
her
eyes
brimmed
with
shimmering
gratitude
just
then
two
boys
passed
the
corner
of
the
rain
one
of
them
noticed
the
hunchback
and
gave
a
derisive
snort
wha
cha
doin
mac
gittin
yer
nuts
off
he
hilary
would
sit
on
the
couch
if
she
did
would
he
sit
next
to
her
hilary
sat
on
the
couch
and
p
s
sat
on
a
chair
opposite
her
he
watched
hilary
lift
a
cigarette
from
a
their
wedding
engraved
upon
it
she
tapped
the
cigarette
on
top
of
the
box
then
picked
up
the
table
lighter
she
flicked
the
lighter
several
times
then
put
it
back
down
on
the
table
p
s
reached
over
and
held
his
lighter
for
her
she
took
the
light
gently
touching
his
hand
as
he
did
so
thanks
she
said
he
watched
hilary
inhale
then
quickly
blow
the
smoke
out
pand
he
said
look

this
is
a
bad
day

wished
he
knew
what
to
do
he
wished
there
were
some
way
he
could
get
her
to
relax
to
be
happy
or
at
least
pleasant
he
hated
not
being
able
to
comfort
her
he
remembered
at
collegewhen
she
and
they
had
made
it
safely
through
another
month
hilary
lifted
her
legs
onto
the
coffee
table
and
leaned
back
on
the
couch
from
the
way
she
was
sitting
her
shorts
were
pulled
tight
around
her
and
he
could
not
help
but
look
p
s
forced
himself
to
look
away
what
do

in
washingtondo

keep
cool

sweetly

he
was
nt
even
conscious
of
it
until

her
forehead
against
his
cheek

her
move
her
head
the
way
she
always
used
to
when
they
had
danced
together
the
slight
tilting
and
lowering
of
her
forehead
to

her
hair
away

nudging

does
nt
like
me
to
keep
the
car
inside
his
property
i
always
leave
it
near
the
road
we
stepped
out
of
the
car
rosencrantz
offering
to
carry
my
grip
i
thanked
him
and
told
him
that
it
was
very
light
and
that
i
could
manage
it
he
saw
me
staring
at
the
fence
nick
he
said
the
fence
is
nothing
it
s
no
more
than
a
marker
he
pointed
to
the
kennels
that
were
placed
in
strategic
positions
all
along
the
fence
the
kennels
had
white
washed
walls
and
neatly
shingled
roofs
there
is
uncle
nate
s
protection
a
bulldog
with
an
enormous
snout
lounged
inside
the
kennel
nearest
rubin
s
general
the
lead
dog
i
could
ram
the
car
into
the
fence
and
it
would
nt
make
any
difference
to
him
he
never
growls
when
i
m
around
he
knows
i
m
harmless
if
you
came
alone
nick
he
would
have
you
pinned
on
the
ground
by
now
with
half
your
head
in
his
jaws
an
intruder
would
not
get
very
far
here
believe
me
but
as
soon
as
he
sees
you
re
with
me
then
shadrach
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
we
both
scrambled
under
the
fence
there
were
several
sheds
behind
the
kennels
most
of
them
had
makeshift
roofs
and
their
chimneys
generally
sagged
each
shed
had
only
one
window
the
barracks
rosencrantz
said
the
boys
live
there
uncle
nate
is
trying
to
simulate
a
military
arrangement
so
he
has
his
own
little
army
and
the
boys
do
nt
mind
they
enjoy
drilling
with
wooden
rifles
we
walked
past
the
kennels
and
the
sheds
the
home
of
the
general
staff
rosencrantz
said
mockingly
they
say
it
used
to
be
one
of
harriman
s
estates
but
i
think
that
s
just
a
rumor
that
uncle
nate
himself
has
propagated
he
enjoys
creating
his
own
histories
folklore
is
his
favorite
subject
if
you
listen
to
him
the
jews
invented
the
world
and
will
have
a
hand
in
destroying
it
he
is
a
great
believer
in
all
sorts
of
messianic
claptrap
every
time
he
hears
the
thunder
crackle
he
convinces
himself
that
his
deliverer
will
come
and
free
him
and
the
home
and
all
the
jews
throughout
the
world
and
the
president
too
he
would
nt
want
to
have
a
world
without
roosevelt
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
gables
nick
you
see
that
window
with
the
boards
over
it
that
s
where
nathanson
keeps
his
little
dungeon
if
you
re
a
nuisance
you
get
a
warning
and
then
maybe
one
of
the
jailers
works
you
over
but
with
a
major
offense
you
get
three
to
tell
you
about
the
dungeon
bullets
is
in
there
now
uncle
nate
gave
him
the
maximum
we
heard
a
repeated
thud
coming
from
the
cellar
of
the
house
i
stopped
and
tried
to
peek
through
one
of
the
tiny
cellar
windows
but
the
glass
was
backed
with
wire
and
all
i
could
make
out
was
a
few
gray
forms
then
i
heard
a
prolonged
shout
ahhhiii
god
i
said
stepping
back
rosencrantz
gripped
my
arm
it
s
nothing
he
said
the
boys
are
drilling
in
the
gym
murdock
is
teaching
them
some
japanese
bayonet
charges
he
used
to
be
a
marine
a
man
came
out
of
the
house
and
stood
on
the
porch
he
had
a
short
thin
body
and
an
unusually
large
head
he
was
wearing
a
black
skullcap
rosencrantz
turned
towards
him
and
dipped
his
cap
knowingly
shalom
rubin
shalom
his
shoulders
drew
together
under
his
black
coat
rabbi
you
now
nick
rosencrantz
said
shaking
my
hand
his
palm
felt
moist
we
ll
talk
later
goodbye
he
boarded
the
porchand
opened
the
screened
door
he
was
at
least
two
headstaller
than
rubin
later
nick
he
said
again
and
ducking
his
head
he
disappeared
behind
the
screen
rubin
walked
towards
the
edge
of
the
porch
he
was
wearing
thick
soled
work
shoes
he
placed
both
thumbs
in
his
mouth
and
whistled
i
noticed
a
stir
in
one
of
the
kennels
then
the
bulldog
that
we
had
seen
before
bounded
past
the
row
of
sheds
leaving
a
ragged
curtain
of
dust
behind
him
and
before
i
had
the
chance
to
turn
around
the
dog
was
already
on
the
porch
nuzzling
rubin
s
knee
with
his
armor
plated
head
salute
nick
rubin
commanded
him
come
on
shad
shadrach
raised
one
forepaw
grudgingly
come
on
up
rubin
said
smiling
i
was
a
little
alarmed
his
smile
back
did
the
rabbi
give
you
his
usual
spiel
he
asked
me
but
there
was
no
indication
of
a
threat
in
his
voice
we
ought
to
hire
him
as
a
guide
i
shifted
the
grip
there
all
day
now
her
last
breath
was
near
her
children
from
the
soft
pallet
lest
contrary
to
christian
custom
she
should
die
upon
a
feather
bed
i
had
given
them
a
thread
out
of
the
martyr
s
robe
to
place
beneath
her
tongue
and
they
had
done
so
although
serena
was
steadfast
in
saying
only
thy
will
be
done
instead
of
praying
that
her
life
be
spared
now
she
lay
dying
on
the
cold
stone
with
her
children
all
about
her
and
the
young
roger
holding
a
cross
for
her
to
see
benedict
hoped
that
still
the
saint
might
intervene
serena
was
a
woman
of
pure
faith
he
crossed
the
line
of
pilgrims
and
made
his
way
to
her
william
sat
staring
after
him
his
sheepish
grin
fading
to
a
look
of
contemplation
he
knew
the
worth
of
the
monk
s
argument
that
formal
recognition
of
the
miracles
was
slow
in
coming
and
that
as
yet
no
dignitary
of
the
land
had
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
the
poor
to
canterbury
he
knew
that
the
de
brocs
still
menaced
travelers
who
spoke
of
miracles
and
devils
in
the
pilgrims
so
that
they
might
cast
them
out
indeed
at
easter
time
after
the
crypt
had
first
been
opened
to
the
populace
ranulf
de
broc
himself
had
come
to
prior
odo
and
drawn
his
sword
and
threatened
that
he
would
carry
off
the
body
from
the
church
that
night
the
monks
in
secret
took
the
corpse
out
of
its
sepulcher
and
hid
it
in
the
dark
behind
the
altar
of
the
virgin
only
the
next
day
crippled
richard
son
of
einold
had
discovered
it
that
was
a
curious
miracle
william
had
witnessed
it
richard
was
hobbling
past
the
altar
where
unknown
to
him
the
body
lay
when
suddenly
he
cast
away
his
staff
and
fell
upon
his
face
then
rose
again
fell
down
again
and
once
again
rose
up
and
gathered
all
his
strength
and
leaped
upon
the
altar
agile
as
a
boy
when
he
jumped
down
it
was
to
stand
upon
the
soles
of
his
two
feet
like
any
healthy
man
william
had
run
to
him
certain
altar
why
he
had
fallen
there
why
he
had
leaped
on
it
and
richard
answered
i
was
constrained
to
by
the
mother
of
god
thus
the
monks
knew
they
could
not
hide
the
body
from
the
world
they
put
it
back
into
its
sepulcher
and
called
the
masons
in
to
build
a
strong
safeguarding
wall
around
it
but
for
the
pilgrims
sake
they
left
small
apertures
through
which
petitioners
might
reach
their
heads
to
kiss
the
tomb
it
was
a
curious
fact
fitzstephen
noted
that
some
could
put
their
heads
through
easily
indeed
a
wild
man
once
had
climbed
right
through
while
others
though
they
were
no
larger
were
unable
to
william
thinking
these
things
let
his
gaze
fall
on
the
little
desk
that
benedict
used
to
keep
his
records
on
he
saw
a
pile
of
parchments
weighted
by
the
dipper
benedict
had
lain
across
them
when
he
rose
to
go
william
took
them
up
and
held
them
to
the
light
to
read
they
were
the
robert
a
smith
of
thanet
cured
of
a
pain
muriel
of
canterbury
two
years
diseased
the
clerk
s
quick
eyes
raced
over
them
curbaran
a
shoemaker
of
dover
absolutely
and
incredibly
simple
enough
his
eye
was
caught
and
held
he
lifted
the
parchment
above
the
others
and
read
on
simple
enough
to
say
the
lord
s
prayer
daily
for
the
soul
of
the
martyr
not
knowing
that
he
who
prays
for
a
martyr
demeans
the
martyr
was
visited
in
a
dream
by
thomas
who
directed
him
to
dig
in
a
certain
place
under
a
mill
and
he
did
so
and
found
a
very
thick
and
rusty
denarius
which
he
tried
with
his
teeth
and
found
to
be
gold
it
was
a
coin
of
the
emperor
diocletian
and
worth
some
forty
silver
pieces
william
stopped
reading
and
smiled
he
felt
a
glow
of
gratitude
at
the
shoemaker
s
good
fortune
simple
though
he
was
musing
he
looked
up
something
more
he
smiled
again
as
realization
struck
him
gratitude
for
brother
benedict
he
shifted
through
the
parchments
and
began
to
read
again
mad
henry
of
fordwich
dragged
by
his
friends
to
the
tomb
all
yes
he
heard
the
wild
commotion
on
the
steps
that
morning
a
heavy
woman
stood
in
front
of
william
ile
looked
up
to
see
the
matron
from
the
money
smithy
with
her
eve
fastened
upon
him
and
in
her
hands
a
little
package
wrapped
in
linen
cloth
william
smiled
cautiously
over
the
months
wulviva
had
become
increasingly
persistent
in
her
visits
to
the
tomb
the
water
which
had
cured
her
daughter
had
become
quite
famous
since
then
the
monks
had
made
great
quantities
themselves
and
with
it
cured
a
wide
variety
of
ills
and
yet
her
own
son
almon
remained
dumb
ever
more
frequently
she
came
with
him
or
alone
bringing
small
offerings
pleading
some
of
the
monks
had
come
to
think
of
her
as
a
reproach
master
william
what
do
you
think
our
thomas
water
s
worked
another
miracle
pride
and
conspiracy
rasped
in
her
voice
she
knew
he
liked
to
be
the
first
to
hear
such
stories
and
william
s
face
lit
as
it
always
lit
when
he
heard
promise
of
exotic
news
i
have
a
neighbor
she
confided
blind
and
now
sees
he
came
today
to
beg
a
drop
of
our
miraculous
water
and
walter
gave
it
to
him
though
he
holds
it
dear
for
his
wife
s
sake
you
know
that
miracle
fitzstephen
nodded
of
course
he
said
the
monks
have
writ
it
down
she
said
with
satisfaction
but
this
blind
man
walter
brought
the
water
and
he
put
his
finger
in
and
with
it
wet
his
eyes
and
straight
away
he
wiped
away
the
darkness
he
had
come
guided
but
he
went
home
unguided
it
was
a
miracle
even
brother
benedict
will
say
it
was
a
miracle
silent
moment
she
boasted
of
it
to
his
father
his
father
gazed
at
him
and
where
is
the
goose
his
father
said
i
could
not
reach
it
the
boy
said
it
came
so
close
and
then
it
drifted
far
away
he
reeled
from
the
bed
and
drifted
to
the
window
but
the
figure
coming
down
the
street
was
gone
again
he
had
missed
some
unknown
chance
the
street
was
void
a
void
avoid
dog
a
vulture
nothing
more
and
thus
we
parted
sang
lenore
singing
somewhere
somewhere
there
was
singing
his
whole
body
shimmered
with
the
chords
the
fountainhead
of
music
overflowing
the
chords
were
multicolored
vaulting
like
rockets
across
his
consciousness
he
could
break
off
pieces
of
the
music
like
pieces
of
meringue
you
re
sleeping
your
life
away
he
told
the
dog
do
you
hear
me
i
said

you
sleepyhead
the
inn
of
the
dog
and
the
vulture
there
are
voices
you
see
then
singing
voices
then
strange
musics
hollowed
out
as
if
drifted
through
a
wind
tunnel
these
followed
by
a
huge
void
of
bleak
silence
suggesting
death
the
story
of
my
life
by
lewis
moon
now
something
has
happened
was
happening
is
happening
but
will
not
happen
do
you
hear
me
i
said
do
you
hear
me
a
softer
tone
please
to
begin
at
the
beginning
my
name
is
meriwether
lewis
moon
or
is
that
the
end
again
i
was
named
meriwether
lewis
moon
after
meriwether
lewis
who
with
lieutenant
william
clark
crossed
north
america
without
killing
a
single
indian
so
said
my
father
my
father
up
on
north
mountain
alvin
moon
still
traps
and
hunts
and
in
world
war
i
when
still
a
despised
non
citizen
exempt
from
service
joined
those
other
indians
as
insane
as
himself
who
volunteered
to
serve
in
world
war
i
alvin
moon
is
half
cheyenne
he
went
down
south
when
he
came
home
and
took
up
with
a
creole
choctaw
woman
named
big
irma
and
brought
her
back
up
to
his
mountain
the
worst
mistake
that
alvin
moon
ever
made
was
trying
to
educate
himself
his
information
about
lewis
and
clark
was
the
only
piece
of
education
he
ever
obtained
and
it
was
wrong
he
used
to
joke
that
he
could
nt
educate
himself
unless
he
learned
to
read
and
how
could
he
learn
to
read
if
he
did
nt
educate
himself
so
he
left
off
hunting
and
trapping
and
came
down
off
his
mountain
and
took
work
near
the
reservation
to
keep
his
children
in
the
mission
school
to
give
them
a
better
chance
in
life
i
ai
nt
got
nothin
said
joe
redcloud
and
the
hell
of
it
is
i
broke
my
back
paid
out
every
cent
to
keep
then
kids
into
that
school
and
now
they
do
nt
know
no
thin
neither
only
jesus
christ
now
ai
nt
that
somethin
they
sit
around
here
thinkin
about
godamighty
i
reckon
while
they
re
waitin
on
their
gover
ment
reliefs
all
but
meriwether
lewis
again
my
name
is
lewis
moon
and
i
am
lying
on
a
bed
deathbed
in
a
strange
country
and
i
hear
eerie
voices
and
a
crack
is
appearing
on
the
wall
wider
and
wider
and
the
bulb
in
the
ceiling
is
growing
more
and
more
bulbous
and
will
surely
explode
a
crack
of
doom
of
lightning
down
the
walls
the
extract
of
b
caapi
is
a
powerful
narcotic
and
hallucinogen
containing
phenol
alkaloids
related
to
those
found
in
lysergic
acid
and
whether
or
not
it
finds
a
respectable
place
in
the
pharmaceutica
of
man
it
has
held
for
unknown
centuries
an
important
place
at
the
time
of
my
experiment
i
was
lying
in
a
narrow
room
with
a
corpse
in
the
next
bed
with
god
a
vulture
and
a
dog
as
witnesses
wishing
that
marguerite
were
here
marguerite
i
wish
to
tell
marguerite
that
the
reason
i
did
not
make
love
to
her
that
time
in
hong
kong
was
not
because
i
did
not
want
her
but
because
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
in
the
late
low
hours
of
the
week
before
i
had
contracted
a
low
infestation
i
did
not
know
marguerite
well
enough
to
give
her
crabs
you
understand
marguerite
had
alabaster
skin
triumphant
hair
and
an
unmuddied
soul
and
a
swinging
little
ass
into
the
bargain
you
listen

you
re
all
your
people
here
got
left
to
count
on
you
go
get
that
education
hear
me
now
and
then
you
come
on
home
and
learn
it
back
to
us
as
best
you
can
because
the
way
things
are
goin
they
ai
nt
no
hope
for
none
of
us
lessen
we
do
nt
get
somethin
learned
here
to
us
pretty
quick
i
have
opened
my
eyes
again
to
shut
off
all
that
blue
color
can
threaten
overwhelm
whirling
like
that
an
ant
in
a
kaleidoscope
might
sense
the
problem
but
out
here
the
bed
shudders
the
chair
sneaks
the
bureau
budges
they
back
and
fill
his
father
he
is
perhapspeven
more
respected
in
one
particular
only
a
kind
of
scar
he
carries
without
pain
and
without
any
clear
memory
of
the
amputation
does
the
man
he
is
differ
from
the
man
he
assumed
he
would
become
he
never
prays
the
man
stood
up
when
the
woman
entered
the
room
or
to
be
exact
door
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
the
room
was
square
and
furnished
in
a
strange
cool
manner
midway
between
a
home
the
pale
detailed
japanese
prints
on
the
wall
the
thick
carpet
whose
blue
seemed
a
peculiarly
intense
shade
of
silence
the
black
slab
sofa
with
its
single
prism
shaped
pillow
of
airfoam
and
an
office
which
it
was
though
no
instruments
or
books
were
on
view
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
the
people
who
could
appropriately
inhabit
this
room
were
they
not
already
here
the
man
and
woman
both
were
impeccably
groomed
the
woman
wore
ar
linen
suit
with
white
shoes
and
a
white
pocketbook
her
silvery
blond
hair
done
up
tightly
in
a
french
roll
she
neverpwore
a
hat
today
she
wore
no
gloves
the
man
wore
a
summer
suit
of
a
may
slightly
lighter
than
the
woman
s
though
perhaps
it
was
merely
that
he
stood
nearer
the
light
of
the
window
in
this
window
like
the
square
muzzle
of
a
dragon
pinched
beneath
the
venetian
blinds
dimmed
the
light
which
since
this
side
of
the
building
faced
away
from
the
sun
was
already
refracted
the
man
had
a
full
head
of
half
gray
hair
rather
wavy
and
scrupulously
brushed
a
touch
vainly
so
that
a
lock
overhung
his
forehead
as
if
he
were
a
youth
the
woman
had
guessed
he
was
about
ten
years
older
than
she
in
addition
to
the
possibility
of
vanity
she
read
into
this
casually
overhanging
forelock
a
suggestion
of
fatigue
it
was
afternoon
he
had
already
listened
to
so
much
and
an
itch
to
apologize
to
excuse
herself
scratched
her
throat
and
made
her
limbs
bristle
with
girlish
nervousness
he
waited
to
sit
down
until
she
had
done
so
and
even
such
a
small
concession
to
her
sex
opened
a
window
in
the
wall
of
impersonality
between
them
she
peeked
through
and
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
he
seemed
neither
handsome
nor
ugly
she
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
or
what
she
was
expected
heavy
and
petulant
it
lifted
and
innocent
expectation
seemed
to
fill
it
the
customary
flutter
of
panic
seized
her
both
bare
hands
squeezed
the
pocketbook
the
purring
of
the
air
conditioner
threatened
to
drown
her
first
words
she
felt
the
lack
in
the
room
of
the
smell
of
a
flower
in
her
own
home
the
sills
were
crowded
with
potted
plants
i
saw
him
only
once
this
week
she
said
at
last
out
of
polite
habit
she
waited
for
a
reply
then
remembered
that
there
was
no
politeness
here
and
forced
herself
to
go
on
alone
at
a
party
we
spoke
a
little
i
began
the
conversation
it
seemed
so
unnatural
to
me
that
we
should
nt
even
speak
when
i
did
go
up
to
him
he
seemed
very
pleased
and
talked
to
me
about
things
like
cars
and
children
he
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
these
days
and
i
told
him
nothing
he
would
have
talked
to
me
longer
but
i
walked
nt
his
voice
so
much
it
was
his
smile
when
we
were
seeing
each
other
i
used
to
think
that
there
was
a
smile
only
i
could
bring
out
in
him
a
big
grin
whenever
he
saw
me
that
lit
up
his
whole
face
and
showed
all
his
crooked
teeth
there
it
was
when
i
walked
up
to
him
that
same
happy
smile
as
if
in
all
these
months
nothing
had
changed
she
looked
at
the
catch
on
her
purse
and
decided
she
had
begun
badly
the
man
s
disapproval
was
as
real
to
her
as
the
sound
of
the
air
conditioner
it
flowed
toward
her
enveloped
her
in
gray
coolness
and
she
wondered
if
it
was
wrong
of
her
to
feel
it
wrong
of
her
to
desire
his
approval
she
tried
to
lift
her
face
as
if
she
were
not
flirting
in
another
room
she
would
have
known
herself
to
be
considered
a
beautiful
woman
here
beauty
ceased
to
exist
and
she
was
disarmed
realizing
how
she
wondered
if
she
should
try
to
express
this
he
sees
through
me
she
said
it
s
what
made
him
so
wonderful
then
and
what
makes
him
so
terrible
now
he
knows
me
i
ca
nt
hide
behind
my
face
when
he
smiles
and
he
seems
to
be
forgiving
me
forgiving
me
for
not
coming
to
him
even
though
i
ca
nt
the
man
readjusted
himself
in
the
chair
with
a
quickness
that
she
took
for
a
sign
of
impatience
she
believed
she
had
an
honest
gift
for
saying
what
he
did
not
want
to
hear
she
tried
to
say
something
that
in
its
frankness
and
confusion
would
please
him
i
m
suppressing
she
said
he
did
say
one
thing
that
if
he
had
nt
been
my
lover
he
would
nt
have
said
he
looked
down
at
my
dress
and
asked
me
in
this
shy
voice
did
you
put
that
on
just
to
hurt
me
it
was
so
unfair
it
many
dresses
and
i
ca
nt
throw
out
all
the
ones
that
that
i
wore
when
i
was
seeing
him
describe
the
dress
when
he
did
speak
the
level
of
his
interest
often
seemed
to
her
disappointingly
low
oh
she
said
an
orangey
brown
one
with
stripes
and
a
round
neckline
a
summer
dress
he
used
to
say
i
looked
like
a
farm
girl
in
it
yes
he
cut
her
short
with
a
flipping
gesture
of
his
hand
his
occasional
rudeness
startled
her
since
she
could
not
imagine
he
had
learned
it
from
any
book
she
found
herself
lately
afraid
for
him
he
seemed
too
naive
and
blunt
she
felt
him
of
his
clothes
by
the
time
the
door
closed
and
he
tugged
jacy
toward
the
bed
pulling
rudely
at
her
skirt
she
shrugged
loose
and
went
to
the
window
to
undress
at
her
own
pace
if
you
ca
nt
wait
you
can
jump
out
this
window
she
said
i
do
nt
think
it
will
work
anyway
duane
was
not
certain
it
would
either
and
waited
nervously
the
room
was
chill
and
jacy
had
goose
bumps
on
her
breasts
as
she
lay
down
she
looked
at
duane
casually
men
were
certainly
strange
all
she
really
expected
was
something
tickly
but
duane
surprised
her
horribly
he
did
nt
tickle
a
bit
but
instead
he
did
something
really
painful
at
first
she
was
too
startled
to
move
and
then
she
yelled
out
loud
someone
in
an
adjoining
room
kicked
the
wall
indignantly
quit
quit
she
said
it
was
intolerable
duane
was
much
to
thrilled
to
quit
but
fortunately
he
did
nt
take
long
jacy
was
got
gingerly
out
of
bed
meaning
to
take
a
hot
bath
and
discovered
that
the
little
room
did
nt
even
have
a
bathroom
in
it
just
a
lavatory
there
must
be
one
down
the
hall
someplace
duane
said
but
she
would
nt
let
him
go
look
for
it
she
felt
strange
and
wanted
to
leave
all
the
way
back
to
the
motel
she
kept
glancing
over
her
shoulder
expecting
to
see
a
trail
of
blood
on
the
sidewalk
behind
her
duane
was
walking
happily
along
infuriatingly
proud
of
himself
oh
quit
prising
jacy
said
you
need
nt
think
i
m
going
to
take
you
back
just
because
of
that
i
do
nt
think
you
did
it
right
anyway
sure
t
did
duane
said
but
he
was
nt
really
positive
and
he
brooded
about
it
during
the
remainder
of
the
trip
they
did
it
twice
more
once
in
the
motel
in
san
francisco
and
once
icc
flagstaff
arizona
on
the
right
but
for
some
reason
jacy
did
nt
swoon
with
bliss
she
only
allowed
it
twice
more
because
she
thought
bobby
sheen
would
like
it
if
she
had
a
little
more
experience
the
whole
business
was
far
from
delightful
but
she
supposed
that
was
probably
because
duane
was
a
roughneck
in
flagstaff
it
went
on
much
too
long
and
she
got
exasperated
and
told
him
off
once
and
for
all
you
never
will
learn
she
said
i
do
nt
know
why
i
went
with
you
so
long
i
guess
we
have
to
keep
on
being
sweethearts
until
we
get
home
but
that
s
gon
na
be
the
end
of
it
we
ll
just
have
to
think
of
something
big
to
break
up
over
duane
just
could
nt
understand
it
he
was
more
dejected
and
more
in
love
than
he
ever
had
been
jacy
was
bending
over
to
slip
her
small
breasts
back
into
their
brassiere
cups
she
had
never
looked
more
lovely
and
he
could
not
believe
she
was
serious
about
breaking
up
he
went
over
to
the
motel
dressing
table
and
combed
her
hair
thoroughly
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
paying
absolutely
no
attention
to
him
the
rest
of
the
way
home
across
arizona
new
mexico
texas
he
tried
to
think
of
ways
to
make
her
realize
that
they
had
to
stay
together
he
was
sure
her
disaffection
would
only
be
temporary
jacy
was
thinking
how
glad
she
would
be
to
get
home
she
had
even
decided
there
was
no
point
in
making
a
big
production
of
breaking
up
she
was
sick
and
tired
of
the
seniors
as
an
audience
they
were
not
worth
bothering
about
when
the
bus
finally
pulled
into
thalia
late
one
june
afternoon
she
did
nt
so
much
as
tell
duane
good
bye
she
was
tired
and
went
right
over
to
her
parents
cadillac
while
her
father
got
her
bags
lois
was
watching
her
shrewdly
i
see
you
got
enough
of
him
she
said
quietly
that
s
that
i
m
just
not
interested
in
saying
one
word
lacy
said
watching
them
drive
away
duane
felt
a
little
sick
at
his
stomach
he
realized
jacy
had
meant
what
she
said
she
was
really
done
with
him
it
was
very
confusing
to
him
because
he
had
always
thought
you
were
supposed
to
get
whoever
you
really
loved
that
was
the
way
it
worked
in
movies
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
carry
his
suitcase
to
the
pickup
sonny
had
merely
endured
the
return
trip
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
bus
watching
the
desert
go
by
he
had
paid
duane
and
jacy
as
little
attention
as
possible
and
it
was
not
until
he
and
duane
got
in
the
pickup
in
thalia
that
he
noticed
his
friend
was
depressed
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
surprised
nothin
duane
said
sonny
knew
better
well
what
is
it
he
persisted
you
feel
bad
for
a
moment
duane
considered
telling
the
truth
but
then
he
decided
not
to
i
m
worn
to
s
hard
on
a
person
they
were
living
over
the
poolhall
billy
with
them
though
genevieve
had
kept
him
while
the
seniors
were
gone
returning
to
the
poolhall
was
a
little
strange
particularly
since
sam
the
lion
was
nt
there
if
he
had
been
there
they
would
have
shot
some
pool
and
had
a
great
time
telling
him
all
about
the
trip
it
would
have
picked
everyone
s
spirits
up
as
it
was
the
poolhall
was
quiet
and
empty
and
there
was
not
a
great
deal
to
do
while
the
seniors
were
in
california
a
great
scandal
rocked
thalia
all
the
mothers
were
agreed
that
it
was
the
very
worst
thing
that
had
ever
happened
in
the
town
john
cecil
was
fired
from
his
teaching
job
for
being
a
homosexual
the
scariest
thing
of
all
the
mothers
thought
was
that
it
was
just
by
a
happenstance
that
he
was
found
out
if
it
had
nt
been
for
coach
popper
s
vigilance
and
his
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
children
nobody
would
have
known
innocents
then
it
happened
giovanni
bruno
lifted
his
hand
mrs
norton
with
a
gasp
stood
rigidly
expectant
marcella
set
the
coffeepot
down
slipped
over
by
the
bed
weak
but
yet
resonant
giovanni
bruno
s
voice
entered
the
still
room
for
the
first
time
the
coming
of
light
mrs
norton
drew
a
quick
sharp
breath
clara
stood
felt
betty
and
elaine
fearful
at
her
side
when
asked
mrs
norton
there
was
a
long
pause
giovanni
s
eyes
moved
among
them
returned
to
stare
upon
mrs
norton
sunday
he
said
week
he
dropped
his
hand
clara
started
to
speak
up
to
ask
what
this
was
about
but
mrs
norton
held
up
her
hand
for
silence
the
coming
of
light
she
repeated
and
giovanni
nodded
sunday
week
again
he
nodded
giovanni
bruno
hear
me
is
there
anything
is
there
something
more
a
pause
and
then
he
shook
his
head
so
the
movement
made
his
hair
splay
out
on
the
pillow
and
clara
was
astonished
to
see
how
really
long
it
had
grown
mrs
norton
relaxed
but
when
she
turned
from
the
bed
to
face
them
clara
saw
tension
and
worry
on
her
face
still
what
is
it
asked
clara
though
she
had
already
begun
to
grasp
it
though
frightened
she
was
ready
she
had
been
tested
she
realized
and
found
true
i
do
nt
know
exactly
mrs
collins
then
may
i
she
fingereda
small
gold
medallion
that
hung
around
her
neck
on
a
chain
may
i
explain
something
to
you
clara
nodded
she
sat
in
awe
but
feeling
ely
close
at
her
side
once
more
vince
bonali
stopped
up
at
the
eagles
one
night
for
a
whiskey
keeping
nothing
at
home
but
beer
these
lean
days
from
the
minute
he
walked
into
the
place
he
was
reminded
of
old
angelo
moroni
and
from
then
on
had
gone
to
school
together
hunted
women
together
broken
into
mining
and
drunk
together

best
men
at
each
other
s
weddings
had
worked
their
ways
up
simultaneously
to
be
facebosses
out
at
number
nine
and
they
had
always
teamed
up
to
play
pitch
and
pinochle

with
his
hat
tipped
down
to
his
nose
vince
deadpan
with
a
mouthful
of
cigar
unbeatable
goddamn
combination
that
was
mainly
what
hit
him
when
he
walked
in
sal
ferrero
was
shooting
pool
with
georgie
lucci
vince
carried
his
whiskey
over
sat
down
on
a
stool
to
watch
they
bandied
sober
hellos
around
sal
and
angie
and
he
used
to
make
a
trio
ever
since
sal
married
ange
s
sister
in
recent
years
sal
only
worked
as
a
repairmanin
the
mine
and
in
a
different
section
at
that
so
they
d
kind
of
split
apart
but
family
functions
always
saw
them
together
again
and
he
and
sal
had
seen
a
lot
of
each
other
since
the
disaster
sal
was
a
small
wiry
man
knew
how
to
joke
around
with
the
best
of
them
always
on
hand
when
help
was
needed
he
was
one
of
the
first
guys
down
into
the
mine
after
the
explosion
told
vince
later
he
d
mainly
gone
down
to
look
for
him
and
ange

d
found
ange
okay
lucci

one
of
the
four
guys
in

blast
and
run
out
without
knowing
where
they
were
going

and
his
buddy

georgie
down
the
length
of
his
cue
pair
of
clicks
he
pocketed
both
the
nine
and
the
fifteen
then
proceeded
to
clean
the
table
sal
plunked
a
half
dollar
on
the
table
while
georgie
was
still
lining
up
the
last
ball

he
said
so
it
was
friday
the
thirteenth

asked
georgie
leaning
into
his
shot
not
yet
vince
had
found
himself
caught
up
in
an
odd
sense
of
nervous
exhilaration
the
past
week
or
so
but
it
was
starting
to
fade
on
him
what
kicked
it
off
was
saying
out
loud
what
he
d
wanted
to
say
for
thirty
years
he
was
through
with
coalmining
he
d
put
in
a
couple
applications
around
town
talked
to
different
people
boasted
how
he
was
commencing
the
new
life
fifty
years
or
no
everybody
d
agreed
that
yes
by
god
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
took
a
lot
of
nerve
to
try
to
learn
new
tricks
when
you
were
appreciated
that
in
fact
they
sometimes
harped
on
it
so
much
vince
would
get
a
little
jittery
just
what
the
hell
could
he
learn
to
do
he
d
ask
himself
then
just
as
quickly
he
d
shove
the
dumb
question
aside
let
s
see
what
they
ask
him
to
learn
first
georgie
plucked
the
coin
off
the
felt
emptied
the
far
pockets
as
sal
racked
i
hear
guido
mello
got
on
at
the
garage
where
lem
filbert

working
he
said
and
chalked
his
cue
yeah
that
s
right
vince
said
he
d
tried
there
asked
too
late
awful
lot
of
guys
seemed
to
have
the
same
idea
he
had
vince
s
kids
the
two
still
at
home
charlie
and
angie
had
showed
right
off
they
were
pleased
had
talked
up
the
change
they
made
big
plans
for
the
future
charlie
actually
getting
halfway
friendly
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
the
kid
s
useless
life
would
flash
had
turned
up
vince
always
returned
the
boy
a
healthy
line
give
the
kid
a
little
ambition
by
example
began
to
consider
taking
him
fishing
when
spring
came
on
charlie
had
never
taken
an
interest
like
the
other
boys

upstatefor
a
couple
days
maybe
sleep
out
warmish
and
slippery
poor
season
there
was
nt
much
juice
too
little
rain
and
the
fruit
should
have
been
laced
with
kirsch
or
drowned
in
white
wine
his
name
was
tott
remember
something
bester
telegrapher
ticket
taker
grocery
clerk

maybe
or
real

others
enclosed
pools
of
green

where
pickles
drowsed
like

still
others
held
up
mounds
of

among
conserves
and

and
bowls
of
candied
carrots
scalloped
potatoes
and
baked

bulged
above
the

scraping

while
baskets
heaped
with

were
set
among

of

an

lips
have
lettuce
like

there
was
a
little
embarrassment
at
the
platform
when
he
went
so
briskly
off
to
pee
but
really
it
was
all
right
because
he
was
in
a
sweat
to
see
the
tower
of
god
the
spike
that
was
to
spit
him

he
covered
his
eyes
his
stomach
gurgled
he
still
heard
the
train
he
d
seen
everything
through
a
haze
the
stack
spitting
cinders
the
dirt
smears
dancing
the
impatient
flies
there
was
a
landscape
of
flaws
in
the
glass
footprints
of
fingers
and
he
found
himself
traveling
along
them
ticking
each
off
carefully
as
though
they
were
squares
composing
the
perilous
wandering
path
of
a
children
s
game
it
wound
over
blue
gray
wastes
and
sticky
rivers
the
mirror
bleary
the

he
shook
as
though
riding
dust
on
the

boot
marks
in
the
aisles
the

close
and
still
the
heat
profound
a
passage
to
hell
here
under
the
rose
smiling
slope
and
the
shoe
creaking
stair
in
company
with
the
sound
of
water
and
the
oppressive
smell
of
his
his
image
and
he
bent
above
the
basin
proposing
to
purify
himself
in
preparation
for
a
feast
of
love
he
began
to
understand
the
nature
of
his
destination
and
the
extent
of
his
punishment
so
far
there
were
significant
absentees
the
husband
of
the
ledge
chested
lady
for
instance
and
the
husband
of
the
woman
with
the
fatuous
first
name
neither
was
present
undoubtedly
they
scorned
him
they
hated
his
appointment
his
having
been
so
hastily
thrust
upon
them
so
immoderately
squeezed
between
the
rails
of
their
objections
and
he
was
cityish
too
quite
plainly
sour
and
runty
with
a
handshake
far
from
hearty
even
one
might
say
unmanly
better
that
a
preacher
stutter
and
he
had
a
noticeable
general
shiver
though
these
seizures
seemed
infrequent
and
he
was
pale
truly
pale
like
one
whom
caves
have
shaded
yes
overall
he
gave
the
impression
of
something
unwholesome
and
hidden
he
was
the
same
species
as
the
spider
bat
or
beetle
companions
who
a
class
which
he
was
a
determined
gabbler
who
knew
what
else
or
they
were
not
scorners
but
the
scorned
themselves
or
rather
being
husbands
who
no
there
was
hanky
panky
somewhere
certainly
and
rancor
you
could
count
on
it
petty
local
pride
and
fancied
injuries
little
intrigues
like
snarls
of
twine
well
his
host
was
pleased
with
his
ah
dear
me
his
divers
lavers
better
make
no
mention
that
direction
wit
and
pedantry
were
out
of
place
among
these
dreary
villagers
trees
hills
river
yet
life
was
monotonously
flat
straight
plankish
with
a
dreadful
sameness
everywhere
like
dust
a
climate
without
any
real
extremes
deprived
of
virtue
even
in
its
mean
though
there
were
trees
the
sloping
fields
the
river
still
life
was
hard
level
wooden
inevitable
and
moments
ran
on
mindlessly
like
driven
cattle
and
young
men
struggled
in
the
for
a
while
like
dripping
fish
before
wearing
out
their
wills
and
settling
down
to
live
with
the
rest
of
the
gently
poor
their
pets
and
their
obsequious
diseases
where
bitterness
grew
up
on
everything
like
ivy
yet
the
fact
was
he
wanted
their
good
opinion
lord
lord
he
was
a
dreadful
creature
why
did
he
mind
they
were
such
small
potatoes
how
could
they
nourish
him
furber
grasped
the
chain
gather
not
my
soul
with
sinners
nor
my
life
with
bloody
men
bowels
up
bladders
down
where
had
they
got
their
money
another
happy
consequence
of
papa
s
passing
on
turreted
scalloped
the
clapboards
patterned
the
roof
tree
edged
with
iron
tracery
the
house
was
huge
with
wide
curving
porches
and
a
stained
glass
minute
in
which
to
catch
the
room
unawares
to
see
a
strange
room
with
a
stranger
s
eyes
but
this
was
play
acting
and
slightly
pompous
not
a
role
blix
could
maintain
for
long
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
smiled
at
me
where
s
the
ice
cream
melted
of
course
i
thought
that
she
who
never
shed
a
tear
because
of
pain
might
cry
now
for
lack
of
what
she
d
counted
on
there
s
more
i
told
her
lots
more
a
half
gallon
we
can
eat
all
night
will
you
eat
too
a
usual
night
i
do
nt
intend
just
to
watch
you
she
had
cried
once
from
pain
i
thought
in
the
kitchen
stirring
the
powdered
coffee
into
ice
cream
i
remembered
what
blix
had
told
me
on
the
evening
i
had
persuaded
her
that
her
hand
would
know
when
the
time
came
to
reach
for
that
plastic
container
she
had
cried
the
afternoon
before
some
fierce
pang
unaffectedby
shots
or
pills
had
gripped
her
she
had
gotten
out
of
bed
and
folded
herself
crying
into
the
position
knees
and
cheek
to
floor
that
newborn
babies
remembering
a
lost
ease
take
when
sleeping
she
had
stayed
there
without
ease
unsleeping
silently
crying
when
she
did
get
up
a
tear
damp
spot
large
as
a
puppy
s
wetting
was
left
to
gray
the
white
carpet
the
next
day
persuaded
that
her
hand
would
be
knowledgeable
she
said
tassie
do
you
know
why
i
cried
yesterday
after
noon
because
was
hurting
but
that
was
nt
why
i
cried
i
cried
because
i
was
happy
i
was
glad
to
feel
the
pain
get
fierce
it
would
help
me
to
want
to
do
what
i
had
to
do
i
did
nt
know
about
trusting
my
hand
then
i
thought
i
d
have
to
be
given
a
shove
and
this
was
the
shove
i
needed
the
pain
did
nt
make
me
cry
the
happiness
did
i
thanked
god
for
the
pain
blix
was
still
in
the
living
room
when
i
came
back
from
the
kitchen
with
the
food
she
surprised
me
by
saying
let
s
eat
in
here
i
put
the
tray
on
the
coffee
table
the
ice
cream
was
good
strong
and
bittersweet
blix
i
asked
do
you
remember
the
funny
ice
cream
fad
you
brought
to
brenner
the
summer
you
stayed
with
me
and
everett
ice
cream
fad
i
remember
a
lot
about
brenner
that
summer
but
if
there
was
a
funny
ice
cream
been
anything
funny
about
it
at
the
time
not
to
us
involved
in
it
anyway
something
ludicrous
yes
but
that
only
added
to
the
misery
to
know
that
what
you
re
doing
is
ludicrous
to
hate
being
ludicrous
but
unable
to
stop
talking
to
blix
all
those
years
later
the
whole
summer
was
funny
too
sad
for
tears
the
ice
cream
episode
funny
as
a
crutch
exactly
that
funny
a
story
of
accidents
and
cripplings
some
of
the
story
which
started
with
melon
a
la
mode
blix
had
never
heard
before
i
told
her
partly
to
make
her
laugh
partly
since
she
was
short
changed
on
future
to
give
her
more
past
do
nt
you
remember
i
asked
her
that
you
took
cleaned
cantaloupes
to
the
tahquitz
confectionery
that
summer
and
had
ice
cream
put
in
them
no
i
think
you
re
making
it
up
how
could
i
make
up
anything
like
that
what
i
i
remember
is
manuel
but
your
cantaloupe
caper
was
what
gave
me
a
chance
to
be
with
him
so
i
remember
the
cantaloupes
too
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
stepped
out
of
my
role
of
elder
sister
to
blix
admitted
i
was
no
example
mentioned
the
name
of
a
man
not
my
husband
mentioned
manuel
s
name
a
kind
of
sick
emptiness
filled
me
as
i
did
so
i
was
saying
good
by
to
a
part
i
had
played
for
so
long
that
without
it
i
did
nt
know
who
i
was
no
i
knew
who
i
was
but
i
did
nt
know
how
publicly
to
be
the
person
i
was
face
to
face
i
knew
my
own
self
but
i
had
never
let
blix
face
me
the
craze
that
blix
introduced
to
brenner
that
summer
was
a
mild
one
well
suited
to
a
pilgrim
campus
where
it
had
started
there
the
college
kids
had
taken
cleaned
cantaloupe
halves
to
the
local
ice
cream
parlor
and
enjoyed
cantaloupe
patch
of
small
but
flavorsome
melons
out
beyond
the
chicken
houses
blix
cleaned
a
half
a
dozen
of
these
one
morning
kept
them
in
the
cooler
all
day
and
when
milt
came
over
that
evening
proposed
a
trip
to
town
to
get
them
filled
milt
was
nt
able
that
summer
to
deny
blix
anything
not
even
her
request
that
blackie
and
i
go
along
can
manuel
come
too
blackie
asked
who
s
manuel
milt
wanted
to
know
everett
s
sulphur
foreman
a
mexican
sure
he
wo
nt
want
to
go
then
milt
said
but
he
did
and
milt
with
his
twosome
already
ruined
did
nt
really
care
how
many
more
crowded
into
the
back
seat
of
his
packard
blix
was
up
front
with
him
blackie
manuel
and
i
and
the
twelve
melon
halves
were
in
back
i
sat
in
the
middle
between
blackie
and
manuel
i
did
nt
have
to
talk
blackie
took
shoulder
to
knee
to
ankle
there
was
no
possible
way
i
could
avoid
touching
manuel
fate
does
nt
often
make
you
gifts
like
that
the
trip
to
town
was
over
in
a
minute
of
course
and
the
melon
eating
did
nt
take
much
longer
manuel
paid
milt
would
have
except
that
he
saw
that
to
do
so
would
hurt
manuel
s
pride
besides
leaving
manuel
tied
up
with
change
making
and
blackie
eating
his
last
half
melon
to
the
rind
and
me
waiting
for
the
two
of
them
gave
him
the
opportunity
he
wanted
when
manuel
blackie
and
i
stepped
outside
the
confectionery
the
packard
was
school
if
he
borrowed
from
his
mother
and
if
he
to
do
with
the
money
there
are
good
questions
about
her
finances
did
he
support
her
before
he
died
if
he
did
we
ll
know
that
he
was
more
involved
with
her
than
he
let
you
know
maybe
he
called
her
from
his
office
i
do
nt
think
so
she
said
i
think
it
was
as
he
said
he
did
nt
have
anything
to
do
with
her
did
you
look
at
his
office
telephone
bills
no
i
will
maybe
he
did
borrow
from
her
for
the
divorce
she
said
that
would
explain
why
she
was
so
against
it
and
why
she
s
been
friendly
with
betty
he
did
nt
answer
he
had
steered
her
away
from
the
night
maciverhad
declined
to
be
photographed
spending
money
he
had
intended
to
conceal
leland
could
nt
help
wondering
himself
it
was
too
interesting
as
a
public
accountant
maciver
had
moved
in
business
circles
and
there
was
no
telling
how
law
he
had
done
his
clients
taxes
mike
did
leland
s
and
karen
s
and
the
law
was
that
the
accountant
was
as
responsible
for
errors
as
the
man
whose
name
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
form
pleland
sat
up
as
he
felt
himself
trying
to
move
ahead
and
gather
together
what
he
had
learned
somehow
maciver
had
made
his
start
and
acquired
the
money
for
the
divorce
settlement
and
from
there
he
had
gone
on
to
accumulate
a
quarter
of
a
million
he
could
have
been
made
a
loan
by
his
mother
it
supported
the
things
norma
had
just
said
about
the
mother
s
attitude
toward
her
son
but
leland
did
nt
care
about
that
maciver
had
been
an
accountant
nothing
more
and
in
five
years
and
some
months
he
had
earned
enough
to
save
two
hundred
and
thirty
two
thousand
dollars
no
one
had
said
that
he
had
worked
very
hard
he
had
gone
out
courted
a
second
wife
married
her
set
up
a
new
home
he
had
gone
to
have
won
all
his
money
he
would
have
been
paying
taxes
on
it
right
along
or
his
estate
would
be
tied
up
at
this
moment
while
back
taxes
were
being
determined
how
maciver
had
made
his
money
and
why
he
had
died
if
indeed
his
death
had
had
anything
to
do
with
his
money
remained
as
veiled
as
they
had
been
yesterday
when
norma
had
entered
leland
s
office
seeing
it
all
in
these
terms
leland
could
feel
the
despair
of
which
she
had
spoken
they
would
get
so
close
and
no
more
they
would
have
to
give
it
up
concerned
with
other
issues
leland
hoped
norma
drove
her
late
husband
s
car
with
sureness
and
visible
enjoyment
across
the
county
line
into
the
city
of
port
smith
the
sky
was
black
now
and
the
roads
were
still
jammed
with
people
going
home
to
dinner
port
smith
was
no
place
for
the
scant
pleasures
of
late
autumn
it
was
gray
and
damp
in
the
days
and
in
the
nights
it
became
so
and
turned
toes
and
fingers
yellow
green
for
lack
of
circulation
every
patrolman
in
port
smith
knew
the
trick
of
ten
deep
breaths
the
streets
averaged
six
feet
above
the
water
table
where
the
land
was
soft
most
of
new
port
smith
was
mounted
on
a
black
glacier
scored
rock
but
that
provided
no
better
insulation
against
the
weather
one
of
the
results
of
the
winter
cold
was
that
the
people
of
port
smith
a
sophisticated
and
comfort
conscious
lot
were
hardier
and
less
vulnerable
than
most
americans
expected
at
this
point
in
his
life
leland
both
disliked
and
was
concerned
with
this
city
the
cynicism
that
was
the
product
of
the
sophistication
and
toughness
was
enough
to
keep
the
people
from
demanding
a
direction
from
the
government
and
the
increase
in
the
numbers
of
colored
people
creating
the
division
of
rich
from
poor
along
the
color
line
was
building
a
half
rational
dissatisfaction
that
was
now
of
subcrisis
proportions
since
the
beginning
of
history
cities
had
built
on
top
of
themselves
layer
upon
layer
and
port
smith
was
no
exception
stood
buildings
whose
construction
no
one
remembered
port
smith
was
rife
with
citizens
committees
study
groups
and
action
teams
composed
of
people
who
had
not
taken
part
in
civic
affairs
before
it
was
leland
s
own
port
smith
upbringing
that
made
him
wish
them
well
but
made
him
wonderabout
the
sort
of
people
who
ran
out
nightly
to
meetings
that
accomplished
nothing
that
which
he
thought
was
most
sane
inside
him
considered
those
people
and
their
meetings
as
the
city
s
best
hope
leland
lived
in
manitou
now
legitimately
none
of
it
was
his
business
that
most
sane
thing
inside
him
had
to
view
his
concern
as
only
an
extension
of
the
satisfaction
he
felt
when
he
read
that
port
smith
college
won
a
baseball
game
or
two
in
the
course
of
a
full
season
now
norma
said
what
i
ca
nt
understand
is
why
he
married
her
that
s
something
we
ll
never
know
we
d
better
just
forget
about
it
he
was
young
she
said
he
needed
someone
kaminsky
told
me
that
his
wife
thought
that
your
husband
was
a
terrific
character
i
took
it
to
mean
that
he
was
impressive
polished
and
mature
it
was
college
but
she
was
twenty
two
at
the
time
maturity
is
something
college
women
look
for
i
think
he
was
quiet
she
said
vehemently
women
mistake
quietnessfor
maturity
he
could
have
been
mature
yes
but
he
could
have
been
lonely
too
your
dr
roberts
is
the
one
to
see
on
that
leland
said
are
you
angry
with
me
you
re
not
waiting
for
the
facts
norma
now
we
might
just
catch
something
on
the
state
of
his
mind
in
those
days
his
wingman
could
give
us
some
ideas
if
all
else
fails
that
s
something
to
think
about
for
later
on
in
the
meantime
stop
thinking
leave
that
to
me
the
others
ventured
to
ask
his
majesty
for
whom
this
special
prayer
was
intended
my
new
privado
is
the
queen
he
replied
and
dropping
on
one
knee
he
kissed
her
hand
pand
now
how
much
further
to
agreda
not
more
than
a
league
or
so
sire
there
have
been
days
when
we
have
gone
no
further
than
that
from
sunrise
to
sunset
and
it
is
my
hope
that
we
may
cross
the
provincial
frontier
from
castile
into
aragon
before
nightfall
however
if
we
are
late
in
reaching
agreda
or
if
we
are
detained
there
longer
than
i
expect
that
will
be
impossible
we
shall
not
be
late
in
reaching
agreda
sire
and
we
need
be
detained
there
no
longer
than
your
observed
true
but
they
may
be
kept
to
the
minimum
the
king
sighed
without
answering
and
the
second
speaker
don
luis
de
haro
true
to
his
role
of
el
discreto
saw
no
point
in
pursuing
the
question
though
word
had
already
reached
them
that
town
and
gown
were
preparing
special
festivities
in
honor
of
the
royal
visit
by
his
own
fatigue
he
could
easily
gauge
the
king
s
and
the
latter
s
longing
to
reach
the
end
of
their
travels
it
was
more
than
five
weeks
since
they
had
left
madrid
for
zaragoza
and
the
journey
over
rough
roads
even
though
it
had
been
made
in
a
superb
state
coach
lined
in
crimson
brocade
and
provided
with
a
couch
on
which
the
king
could
recline
instead
of
having
been
made
on
horseback
had
been
a
hard
one
indeed
don
luis
was
disposed
to
think
that
the
other
method
would
have
been
easier
as
well
as
quicker
unfortunately
that
was
contrary
to
the
rules
of
etiquette
not
with
equerries
and
outriders
and
a
suitable
suite
though
in
this
instance
the
size
of
the
suite
had
been
greatly
reduced
simplicity
like
economy
according
to
philip
was
now
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
don
luis
would
have
been
perfectly
content
if
the
retrenchment
were
such
that
he
need
not
be
included
among
those
chosen
to
accompany
the
king
especially
as
there
had
never
previously
been
such
prolonged
stops
at
all
the
convents
monasteries
and
churches
along
the
way
alcala
de
henares
guadalajara
siguenza
medinaceli
almazan
tajahuercedel
campo
villar
del
campo
pompous
bishops
drowsy
priors
garrulous
abbesses
it
seemed
the
prayers
of
all
these
were
needed
for
the
remission
of
his
majesty
ssins
and
the
redemption
of
prostrate
spain
luis
de
haro
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
every
time
the
king
committed
adultery
and
despite
his
pallor
and
his
languor
he
must
be
possessed
of
extraordinary
virility
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
were
to
be
elicited
they
would
have
time
for
nothing
else
if
the
defenders
at
rocroy
those
world
famous
tercios
were
not
powerful
enough
to
end
the
long
siege
of
the
one
and
prevent
the
crushing
defeat
of
the
other
how
could
it
be
hoped
that
the
mumbling
patter
of
cloistered
monks
would
have
more
effect
and
then
there
had
been
that
inexplicable
change
of
plan
after
leaving
guadalajara
don
luis
knew
that
the
king
had
intended
to
make
the
convent
of
valfermoso
de
las
monjas
near
utande
one
of
his
stops
and
there
had
been
much
speculation
among
his
attendants
as
to
what
this
might
portend
and
a
good
many
whispered
opinions
and
surreptitious
winks
not
to
mention
wagers
had
been
exchanged
although
fourteen
years
had
passed
since
la
calderona
had
insisted
on
the
rupture
of
her
relations
with
the
king
despite
his
vehement
and
brokenhearted
protests
and
had
entered
a
convent
in
the
remote
badiel
valley
none
of
them
had
forgotten
her
charm
her
grace
her
gentleness
she
was
only
a
little
past
thirty
now
in
short
she
should
barely
have
reached
the
zenith
luis
and
the
others
to
believe
that
in
seeking
her
out
the
king
intended
to
ask
only
for
her
prayers
oh
doubtless
the
visit
would
begin
correctly
enough
as
philip
himself
put
it
the
traditional
courtesies
must
be
observed
the
nun
two
nuns
would
be
on
one
side
of
the
grille
and
the
king
with
an
at
tendant
nobleman
on
the
other
but
philip
would
soon
find
a
pretext
for
dismissing
both
her
companion
and
his
then
he
would
give
her
news
of
their
son
the
namesake
of
the
king
s
famous
great
uncle
don
juan
of
austria
such
a
promising
boy
so
handsome
so
intelligent
so
manly
that
everyone
in
the
palace
of
the
zarzuela
where
he
was
established
in
princely
fashion
was
loud
in
his
praises
after
assuring
her
of
the
boy
s
welfare
and
progress
the
king
would
go
on
to
describe
the
ceremony
which
had
taken
place
when
their
don
juan
at
the
age
of
twelve
was
brought
to
madrid
and
by
decree
the
son
of
charles
v
sor
dolores
was
that
what
she
called
herself
now
could
not
help
but
be
moved
by
such
a
recital
and
when
his
majesty
told
her
that
he
would
require
lodging
for
the
night
for
himself
and
his
attendants
could
she
refuse
to
give
it
to
him
to
be
sure
she
was
not
another
sor
margarita
who
must
have
been
a
hussy
at
heart
or
she
would
have
found
a
way
with
the
help
of
her
abbess
to
make
herself
inaccessible
to
the
king
despite
the
tunnel
leading
from
villanueva
s
basement
to
the
cloister
of
san
placido
there
had
never
been
anything
of
the
hussy
about
la
calderona
the
king
had
been
her
one
and
only
love
as
don
luis
himself
and
a
number
of
others
who
had
tried
in
vain
to
prevail
against
her
chastity
could
testify
and
she
had
loved
the
king
as
a
man
and
not
as
a
monarch
but
had
she
ever
ceased
to
love
him
despite
her
flight
and
her
vows
and
the
at
the
hands
of
giovanni
battista
pamfili
the
papalnuncio
had
the
king
ever
ceased
to
love
her
despite
his
weakness
and
his
profligacy
and
his
futility
don
luis
did
not
think
so
and
neither
did
and
for
the
love
of
christ
said
higgins
are
you
saying
he
took
an
involuntary
step
backward
when
you
told
me
about
that
name
plate
art
i
suddenly
thought
about
that
room
on
the
fourth
floor
and
also
what
little
oscar
said
that
morning
we
broke
the
news
to
quiet
here
they
come
let
s
give
them
a
little
surpriseparty
reluctantly
hackett
and
higgins
joined
him
in
the
room
on
either
side
of
the
door
faint
voices
an
upset
all
because
of
ellie
bringing
the
police
down
on
us
when
that
mexican
one
said
that
about
a
search
warrant
i
really
thought
i
should
be
sick
and
if
you
da
told
me
about
it
then
ben
i
coulda
told
you
silly
damn
idea
go
knock
him
on
the
head
would
nt
stop
the
rest
of
em
i
will
be
glad
when
this
is
all
over
just
like
ellie
to
poor
woman
pencil
thin
beam
of
light
pausing
in
the
doorway
vague
dark
outlines
of
the
three
of
them
there
one
figure
bending
tugging
i
rather
think
this
must
be
earl
it
s
lighter
poor
earl
so
young
to
hackett
felt
the
hair
was
standing
straight
up
on
his
head
a
second
figure
was
just
bending
over
the
first
when
mendoza
switched
on
his
own
powerful
flashlight
have
you
got
a
client
at
last
mr
mclaughlin
he
asked
suavely
and
from
pinpointing
oscar
rapidly
swung
the
light
around
to
show
hackett
and
higgins
we
would
be
so
interested
to
hear
all
about
it
oscar
uttered
a
high
pitched
scream
and
fainted
across
the
coffin
before
him
but
in
the
end
it
was
oscar
who
was
most
voluble
they
carted
the
three
of
them
off
to
headquarters
where
ben
kelly
just
glowered
at
them
and
refused
to
answer
any
questions
at
all
and
henry
s
burden
was
i
said
much
better
to
leave
them
what
he
s
got
me
into
but
revived
oscar
was
almost
pathetically
eager
to
talk
his
hot
little
brown
eyes
pleaded
for
understanding
he
gestured
emotionally
you
do
nt
understand
how
it
was
of
course
i
know
what
the
law
says
about
bodies
but
does
nt
any
of
you
remember
how
it
was
the
depression
you
ve
got
to
see
how
it
happened
earl
poor
earl
he
was
only
thirty
four
that
was
back
in
nineteen
thirty
two
and
it
s
just
terrible
to
have
to
tell
you
we
were
brought
up
strictly
but
the
times
and
living
down
here
such
awful
people
some
of
them
were
and
i
m
afraid
he
got
into
bad
company
justa
tiny
bit
drunk
and
fell
down
the
front
stairs
and
i
saw
at
once
his
neck
was
i
was
just
qualified
then
and
my
goodness
do
nt
you
see
a
funeral
would
have
cost
well
there
simply
was
nt
any
money
for
it
i
had
actually
been
put
every
spare
penny
into
my
schooling
because
we
thought
a
regular
business
but
i
had
nt
had
any
clients
at
all
and
there
were
the
taxes
on
the
hotel
not
much
and
ellie
usually
managed
to
help
with
her
store
we
had
to
keep
the
taxes
up
or
we
would
nt
have
had
a
roof
over
our
heads
you
see
that
and
the
cost
of
a
funeral
even
then
those
times
well
we
talked
it
all
over
you
see
the
family
i
mean
and
we
did
nt
see
any
reason
why
not
the
whole
problem
solved
so
easily
and
the
money
saved
for
the
taxes
quite
practical
really
except
of
course
for
the
body
but
i
thought
of
the
top
story
and
i
do
assure
you
everything
was
always
done
according
to
law
except
for
actual
burial
absolutely
hygienic
i
m
a
good
undertaker
i
know
my
job
the
coffins
were
lined
with
lead
and
just
in
case
i
lined
that
room
with
simply
told
people
earl
had
gone
you
see
how
it
was
and
you
just
went
on
the
same
way
asked
mendoza
unwillingly
fascinated
oh
well
ellie
had
nt
believed
in
doctors
said
oscar
vaguely
jane
was
different
but
they
could
nt
ever
afford
and
dorothy
had
nt
been
going
to
a
doctor
either
that
had
looked
very
much
like
a
heart
attack
to
him
we
do
have
to
know
some
medicine
you
know
and
besides
stephen
and
william
were
both
gone
by
then
stephen
had
liver
trouble
and
willie
oscar
thought
had
had
a
stroke
and
each
time
it
had
all
gone
off
without
any
trouble
of
course
i
had
everything
to
hand
and
really
i
assure
you
we
held
a
nice
little
service
for
all
of
them
not
that
we
were
raised
in
any
sect
father
was
a
lifelong
agnostic
but
the
proper
respect
due
the
poor
dead
clay
was
who
oh
well
oscar
floundered
into
long
winded
explanations
first
there
had
been
an
old
woman
amanda
tucker
who
d
lived
at
the
hotel
gone
out
cleaning
for
her
living
found
dead
in
bed
one
day
when
no
one
had
seen
her
for
a
while
and
someone
looked
and
she
had
nt
had
any
money
and
well
yes
i
did
know
that
the
authorities
would
take
care
of
it
if
i
but
after
all
i
am
an
undertaker
and
really
it
seemed
easier
and
besides
one
likes
to
keep
one
s
hand
in
and
so
i
just
mendoza
looked
at
hackett
the
routine
oscar
had
fallen
into
in
lieu
of
legitimate
clients
mr
brown
it
emerged
had
been
another
roomer
died
only
three
months
ago
and
now
oscar
was
chatteringabout
ben
s
brother
if
i
can
make
you
understand
all
done
with
respect
and
taste
but
of
course
i
did
know
how
the
law
reads
but
so
narrow
well
i
was
so
upset
when
i
heard
you
say
about
searching
and
i
only
thought
you
attacked
me
that
night
mr
mclaughlin
i
m
very
very
sorry
said
oscar
earnestly
i
see
now
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
do
henry
said
so
and
i
m
not
a
violent
there
was
every
evidence
that
name
to
go
into
the
new
hampshire
primary
and
had
soundly
trounced
both
orrin
and
ted
each
of
whom
had
maintained
that
their
backers
had
acted
without
their
permission
of
course
the
president
had
maintained
the
same
thing
and
undoubtedlyeach
of
the
three
had
been
convinced
that
his
own
desire
to
remain
aloof
had
been
quite
genuine
nonetheless
there
they
all
were
in
the
contest
and
the
president
had
won
by
a
landslide
then
he
had
again
permitted
his
name
to
go
into
the
wisconsin
primary
this
time
by
dint
of
vehement
insistence
and
threats
of
all
sorts
of
dire
reprisals
against
their
overeager
lieutenants
both
orrin
and
ted
had
managed
to
stay
out
and
give
him
a
clear
field
and
again
he
had
won
by
a
landslide
meanwhile
at
his
press
conferences
he
had
played
a
game
of
half
answer
and
jocular
sidestep
worthy
of
his
predecessor
at
his
peak
nobody
had
pinned
him
down
yet
though
many
skilled
people
had
tried
and
always
for
the
record
he
had
firmly
and
without
equivocation
reiterated
the
statement
succession
a
year
ago
he
would
not
be
a
candidate
for
re
election
with
this
combination
of
noble
purpose
on
the
one
hand
and
political
flirtation
on
the
other
he
had
successfully
kept
the
matter
in
his
own
hands
and
had
as
orrin
told
him
paralyzed
the
two
potential
contenders
who
were
so
anxious
to
succeed
him
the
secretary
of
state
who
was
certainly
not
one
to
be
let
alone
by
walter
dobius
and
his
capable
of
honorworld
in
such
a
personally
embarrassing
situation
found
himself
subjected
to
a
constant
barrage
of
questioning
whenever
he
exposed
him
self
to
the
press
be
it
at
formal
press
conference
or
in
one
of
those
hur
ried
running
interrogatories
that
always
accompany
the
arrival
and
departure
of
a
secretary
of
state
before
the
committees
of
the
con
congress
this
was
an
old
game
and
both
he
and
his
questioners
played
it
with
a
certain
humor
but
the
constant
necessity
to
deny
his
own
ambitions
and
maintain
with
a
straight
face
that
he
saw
no
evidence
of
the
president
s
would
sometimes
in
little
mood
for
jovial
chitchat
this
put
an
extra
burden
on
beth
but
fortunately
her
long
experience
as
an
old
campaigner
s
wife
usually
came
to
the
rescue
in
time
the
more
he
thought
about
it
now
as
the
limousine
crossed
wis
cousin
avenue
passed
ward
circle
and
made
the
final
run
into
spring
valley
the
less
patient
and
less
tolerant
he
felt
about
the
president
harley
was
obviously
about
to
be
confronted
by
a
major
demarche
on
the
part
of
the
jasons
in
this
speech
by
walter
dobius
a
dramatic
rallying
behind
ted
of
all
the
psychological
and
actual
forces
walter
could
command
the
president
could
still
act
but
apparently
he
was
unable
to
see
that
his
area
of
action
would
inevitably
be
restricted
to
some
degree
as
soon
as
all
of
walter
s
friends
and
sup
porters
came
out
on
saturday
with
their
columns
and
editorials
their
news
reports
and
their
special
television
and
radio
playbacks
that
would
the
secretary
knew
flood
the
country
over
the
weekend
a
massive
barrage
of
public
formed
in
the
wake
of
walter
s
speech
the
longer
the
president
waited
the
more
difficult
it
would
be
for
him
to
escape
its
oppressive
and
hampering
confines
as
for
his
own
position
the
secretary
decided
as
the
car
drew
up
at
his
door
and
he
bade
the
driver
good
night
with
wishes
for
a
safe
journey
back
downtown
it
inevitably
would
have
to
be
just
what
he
had
told
beth
earlier
in
the
day
he
would
have
to
announce
his
own
candidacy
whether
the
president
liked
it
or
not
and
he
would
have
to
plunge
immediately
into
his
campaign
he
had
a
reasonably
good
organization
in
most
of
the
states
party
leaders
who
had
supported
him
twice
before
in
his
unsuccessful
tries
for
the
nomination
and
had
given
active
indication
they
would
again
he
had
a
modest
amount
of
money
and
a
few
substantially
moneyed
backers
he
had
his
name
and
his
record
he
had
beth
he
had
himself
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
future
but
as
he
stamped
the
snow
from
his
boots
hall
closet
and
went
along
to
the
comfortable
living
room
where
he
knew
she
would
be
reading
in
front
of
the
fire
he
could
have
wished
that
it
were
arriving
a
little
more
on
his
terms
well
she
said
closing
the
book
new
myths
and
old
realities
by
one
of
walter
s
more
outspoken
competitors
in
the
great
seesaw
of
american
opinion
and
looking
up
with
a
smile
how
did
it
go
he
wants
to
run
but
he
wants
someone
to
tell
him
to
and
did
you
the
secretary
made
a
quizzical
sound
i
certainly
did
and
is
he
he
shook
his
head
in
an
impatient
way
oh
of
course
not
it
will
have
to
be
done
over
and
over
and
all
the
while
he
ll
be
inching
closer
and
closer
suddenly
one
day
he
ll
find
himself
in
it
he
frowned
meanwhile
walter
will
have
made
his
speech
and
it
will
all
end
up
in
a
very
embarrassing
tangle
but
that
s
what
happens
when
you
have
conscience
in
the
white
house
the
white
house
always
wins
but
conscience
has
to
have
its
day
i
m
sure
he
has
other
motives
than
just
ego
beth
said
and
the
secretary
nodded
quickly
oh
certainly
i
m
not
denying
harley
s
integrity
or
good
heart
but
it
puts
me
on
the
spot
right
enough
all
right
then
she
said
briskly
when
do
we
hit
the
road
he
gave
her
a
humorously
grateful
smile
and
immediately
looked
more
relaxed
hank
he
said
i
think
you
re
more
bloodthirsty
about
this
than
i
am
when
do
you
want
to
hit
the
road
it
would
be
a
little
premature
before
walter
s
speech
would
nt
it
he
called
by
each
of
them
above
the
co
hong
is
the
emperor
s
personal
squeeze
chief
we
callhim
the
hoppo
he
s
responsible
for
squeezing
the
mandarins
at
canton
the
co
hong
and
he
s
the
biggest
trader
of
opium
by
the
way
and
makes
a
fortune
out
of
it
so
if
you
allow
one
mandarin
on
hong
kong
you
allow
the
whole
tai
pan
book
system
the
mandarin
will
be
a
hoppo
every
chinese
will
be
subject
to
him
every
chinese
trader
who
comes
to
trade
will
be
sold
licenses
and
squeezed
and
in
turn
they
ll
squeeze
us
the
hoppo
will
destroy
those
who
will
help
us
and
help
those
who
hate
us
and
they
ll
never
give
up
until
they
drive
us
out
why
because
they
re
chinese
struan
stretched
to
ease
his
shoulders
feeling
the
tiredness
creeping
over
him
then
walked
over
to
the
sideboard
and
poured
another
brandy
i
wish
i
could
be
chinese
for
an
hour
or
so
he
thought
wearily
then
i
d
be
able
to
finesse
a
million
taels
from
somewhere
with
nae
trouble
if
that
s
the
answer
he
told
himself
then
try
to
think
barbarians
the
mandarin
with
unlimited
power
what
s
the
point
of
power
if
you
dinna
use
it
to
twist
joss
to
help
yoursel
how
can
you
use
your
power
who
has
a
million
taels
whom
can
you
pressure
to
get
it
who
owes
you
favors
what
should
we
do
dirk
i
mean
i
quite
agree
longstaff
said
you
d
better
send
ti
sen
an
immediate
dispatch
tell
him
no
order
him
struan
stopped
abruptly
as
his
brain
cleared
his
fatigue
vanished
you
re
a
stupid
blathering
half
witted
billy
ti
sen
ti
sen
s
your
key
one
mandarin
that
s
all
you
have
to
arrange
two
simple
steps
first
cancel
longstaff
s
agreement
as
it
must
be
canceled
anyway
second
in
a
week
or
two
make
a
secret
offer
to
ti
sen
that
in
return
for
a
million
in
bullion
you
ll
make
longstaff
reverse
his
stand
and
allow
one
mandarin
into
hong
kong
ti
sen
will
leap
at
forced
him
to
concede
he
ll
squeeze
the
co
hong
for
the
million
and
they
ll
be
delighted
to
pay
because
they
ll
immediately
add
it
onto
the
cost
of
the
tea
they
re
dying
to
sell
us
and
we
re
dying
to
buy
poor
little
willie
s
nae
problem
and
none
of
the
other
traders
will
object
to
one
mandarin
we
will
na
call
the
man
mandarin
we
ll
invent
a
new
name
to
throw
the
cleverest
off
the
scent
trade
commissioner
the
traders
will
na
object
to
the
chinese
trade
commissioner
because
he
ll
assist
trade
and
simplify
the
paying
of
customs
now
who
to
make
the
secret
offer
obviously
old
jin
qua
he
s
the
richest
and
the
most
cunning
of
the
co
bong
and
your
major
supplier
and
you
ve
known
him
twenty
years
he
s
the
one
wi
out
a
doubt
one
mandarin
will
guarantee
the
future
of
the
noble
house
aye
but
he
will
wreck
hong
kong
and
destroy
the
plan
do
you
gamble
to
outsmart
them
later
that
s
a
terrible
risk
you
know
one
mandarin
means
the
whole
system
you
canna
leave
that
devil
legacy
for
robb
or
for
culum
or
for
their
children
but
wi
out
the
bullion
there
s
nae
noble
house
and
nae
future
you
were
saying
dirk
order
ti
sen
in
the
queen
s
name
to
forget
a
mandarin
on
hong
kong
my
thought
entirely
longstaff
happily
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
picked
up
the
quill
what
should
i
say
tai
pan
book
iand
what
should
i
do
poor
willie
about
the
second
step
struan
asked
himself
does
the
end
justify
the
means
write
this
to
ti
sen
at
canton
a
special
proclamation
only
her
britannic
majesty
queen
victoria
has
the
authority
to
appoint
officials
in
the
british
island
of
hong
kong
there
will
be
no
chinese
officials
here
and
no
customshouses
whatsoever
he
hesitated
then
continued
deliberately
sensing
that
the
timing
was
right
colony
of
hong
kong
will
henceforth
be
british
subjects
and
subject
only
to
the
laws
of
england
but
that
exceeds
my
authority
it
s
custom
for
plenipotentiaries
to
exceed
their
authority
that
s
why
they
re
so
carefully
selected
will
that
s
why
we
ve
an
empire
raffles
hastings
clive
raleigh
wellington
you
have
the
plenipotentiary
authority
of
her
majesty
s
government
to
arrange
a
treaty
with
china
what
do
they
know
or
care
about
china
at
home
but
you
re
an
innovator
a
maker
of
history
will
you
re
ready
to
accept
one
tiny
barren
almost
uninhabited
island
when
it
s
a
world
custom
to
grab
whole
continents
when
you
could
take
all
china
if
you
wanted
you
re
so
much
smarter
longstaff
wavered
and
sucked
the
top
of
the
quill
yes
but
i
ve
already
agreed
that
chinese
on
hong
kong
would
be
subject
to
chinese
law
all
forms
of
torture
excepted
a
bead
of
sweat
gathered
on
treaty
and
i
issued
a
special
proclamation
you
ve
changed
your
mind
will
just
as
ti
sen
changed
his
there
was
no
clause
to
appoint
a
mandarin
but
it
was
understood
not
in
your
mind
or
mine
he
s
trying
to
dupe
you
as
he
did
over
chushan
quite
longstaff
agreed
happy
to
be
convinced
you
re
right
dirk
absolutely
if
we
allow
any
control
you
re
right
they
ll
go
back
to
their
old
devilment
what
yes
and
it
s
time
the
chinese
saw
what
justice
really
is
law
and
order
yes
you
re
right
end
the
letter
like
the
emperor
would
fear
this
and
tremblingly
obey
and
sign
it
with
your
full
title

and
opened
the
cabin
door

at

little
blunt

edict
that
would
inhabit
in
the
days

be
nicer

to
persuade
the

branch
of
the
family
to
spend
the
night
in
new
york
as
guests
of
the
goulds
but
with
thanks
nat
rothenberg
declined
he
had
to
be
in
the
market
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
they
had
their
chevy
a
couple
of
hours
and
they
were
in
hartford
the
pragers
wanted
solomon
and
jonas
to
come
to
their
house
which
was
not
far
and
now
it
was
solomon
s
these

norman

them
to

where
they
took
a
subway
home
the
eleven
o

nt
good
the
germans
had
bombed
the
british
north
sea
fleet
german
aircraft
had
sown
so
many
mines
around
the
approaches
to
london
s
port
that
all
shipping
had
to
be
rerouted
currents
of
silence
flowed
from
that
corner
of
the
apartment
which
was
debbie
s
room
solomon
and
jonas
sat
in
the
living
room
and
listened
to
that
silence
and
to
the
news
of
war
pabits
continue
the
cleaning
woman
continued
to
come
once
a
week
and
solomon
and
jonas
continued
in
their
practice
of
dusting
and
vacuuming
between
times
dishes
were
not
left
in
the
sink
solomon
brought
home
fruits
in
season
as
debbie
had
done
and
although
some
of
them
rotted
he
replenished
the
supply
as
though
not
to
do
so
would
open
a
door
to
the
kind
of
dereliction
debbie
had
feared
jonas
even
continued
to
set
mousetraps
but
he
often
forgot
to
look
to
see
if
he
had
since
returning
from
her
honeymoon
she
found
things
quite
satisfactory
recommending
only
that
the
bed
sheets
be
changed
every
week
fresh
sheets
gave
a
fresh
turn
to
each
week
a
psychological
necessity
fresh
sheets
and
fresh
fruits
and
a
regimen
of
cleanliness
maintaineda
semblance
of
the
life
jonas
had
known
he
was
nt
lonely
indeed
he
was
more
occupied
than
he
had
ever
been
before
but
each
time
he
entered
the
apartment
there
came
at
him
along
with
the
ghost
of
debbie
s
appleblossom
which
he
could
nt
be
sure
he
actually
smelled
or
conjured
seance
like
in
his
imagination
a
quality
of
silence
that
brushed
his
senses
so
teasingly
that
he
often
slipped
in
quickly
and
noiselessly
listening
intently
as
though
to
take
it
unawares
and
perhaps
discover
its
meaning
it
was
the
most
evanescent
of
surface
tensions
breaking
at
the
whisper
of
his
own
breathing
leaving
him
with
the
blank
familiarity
of
furniture
that
had
hurriedly
conspired
to
keep
its
secret
the
secret
was
one
he
learned
in
time
at
odd
moments
when
he
was
doing
some
routine
thing
reading
or
passing
through
the
rooms
on
his
way
out
then
out
of
apcorner
of
his
mind
s
eye
he
would
catch
a
spectral
glitter
of
that
surface
tension
hovering
over
a
chair
or
a
table
or
a
whole
room
and
a
hollowness
would
carve
itself
in
his
heart
he
thought
at
first
he
was
only
being
reminded
of
debbie
but
reminders
of
debbie
had
their
own
solid
impacts
easily
recognized
and
easily
rationalized
this
was
different
the
message
was
from
the
objects
themselves
a
plaintiveness
seemed
to
emanate
from
a
chair
a
table
as
if
they
had
lost
contact
with
that
continuity
which
makes
the
things
of
a
home
part
of
the
mortal
rhythm
separated
from
that
continuity
they
had
become
mere
pieces
of
wood
he
had
consigned
them
to
that
fate
and
their
secret
was
no
more
than
his
realization
that
he
had
done
so
the
element
that
had
made
these
objects
a
part
of
time
was
drawn
from
them
when
debbie
left
will
or
interest
or
love
or
whatever
was
required
to
restore
that
element
several
times
during
the
autumn
months
while
the
weather
still
permitted
jonas
had
played
handball
and
while
playing
had
spotted
ira
s
head
above
the
parapet
after
the
games
they
had
walked
along
the
wide
street
then
empty
of
sunning
citizens
and
had
talked
of
the
war
its
coming
seemed
to
have
settled
some
of
the
ferment
in
ira
he
told
jonas
that
clowning
around
had
to
stop
somewhere
short
of
universal
disaster
besides
he
had
said
the
woods
are
full
of
third
rate
comedians
jonas
had
refrained
from
saying
that
ira
was
not
third
rate
although
he
suspected
that
the
other
would
even
now
listen
with
glum
gladness
to
what
needed
no
telling
they
did
nt
go
into
manhattan
during
those
few
smoky
deciduous
afternoons
in
october
and
november
but
stayed
rather
in
the
gould
apartment
which
ira
liked
to
do
listening
to
the
philharmonic
drinking
coffee
talking
once
the
theatre
crowd
all
those
hopeful
and
hopeless
ones
you
do
nt
ever
see
them
do
you
he
asked
which
ones
jonas
asked
taken
with
a
sudden
strong
need
to
talk
of
himself
oh
any
of
them
ira
returned
no
you
would
nt
you
have
no
interest
in
that
crowd
do
you
in
the
crowd
no
jonas
said
i
see
ruth
ruth
ruth
klein
yes
ira
regarded
him
in
puzzlement
for
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
he
gave
a
little
snort
of
laughter
when
did
that
begin
he
asked
way
back
jonas
told
him
seems
like
way
back
july
and
it
s
still
going
strong
seems
to
she
want
to
divorce
but
because
of
the
perilous
conditions
of
transportation
deep
fords
fallen
trees
and
washed
out
roads
making
intercourse
between
the
various
tidewater
estates
in
each
case
a
major
venture
not
to
be
considered
lightly
in
a
great
while
however
every
two
years
or
so
usually
in
the
late
summer
when
the
crops
were
laid
by
marse
samuel
would
decide
to
have
what
he
called
humorously
an
assemblage
and
a
score
of
people
would
come
from
miles
around
planters
and
their
families
from
the
james
and
chickahominy
rivers
and
from
down
in
north
carolina
people
with
names
like
carter
and
harrison
and
byrd
and
clark
and
bonner
arriving
in
elegant
coaches
and
accompanied
by
a
hustling
noisy
entourage
of
black
nursemaidsand
body
servants
they
would
stay
for
four
or
five
days
sometimes
as
long
as
a
week
and
daily
there
would
be
fox
hunts
with
the
hounds
of
major
vaughan
whose
plantation
was
not
far
away
and
turkey
shoots
and
contests
in
horsemanship
pistol
matches
and
picnics
and
a
great
deal
of
contented
somnolent
easy
palaver
among
the
ladies
on
the
veranda
and
at
least
two
fancy
balls
in
the
great
hall
bedecked
for
each
evening
s
merriment
in
yards
of
pink
and
blue
bunting
i
had
reached
the
age
of
sixteen
or
thereabouts
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
chief
usher
a
title
which
marse
samuel
bestowed
upon
me
and
which
involved
my
supervision
of
all
the
negro
help
outside
of
the
kitchen
it
is
possibly
a
measure
of
marse
samuel
s
confidence
in
me
that
he
entrusted
me
with
this
position
as
young
as
i
happened
to
be
doubtless
on
the
other
hand
i
simply
was
quicker
and
smarter
than
all
the
rest
caparisoned
for
a
week
in
purple
velvet
knee
length
pantaloons
a
red
silk
jacket
with
buckles
of
shiny
brass
and
a
white
goat
s
hair
wig
which
culminated
behind
in
a
saucy
queue
i
must
have
presented
an
exotic
sight
to
the
carters
and
the
byrds
but
i
reveled
in
my
role
and
took
great
pleasure
in
bustling
about
and
lording
it
over
the
other
black
boys
most
of
them
enlisted
from
the
fields
dumb
callow
kids
all
thumbs
and
knobby
knees
and
popping
eyes
even
though
each
day
i
was
kept
feverishly
busy
from
dawn
to
dusk
it
the
ladies
dismount
i
too
who
rode
herd
on
lucas
and
todd
and
pete
and
tim
making
certain
that
they
polished
each
night
each
gentleman
s
boots
that
they
cleaned
up
the
litter
on
the
lawn
that
they
hurried
about
ceaselessly
fetching
ice
from
the
ice
cellar
retrieving
a
lady
s
lost
fan
tethering
horses
untethering
them
doing
this
undoing
that
i
was
the
first
to
arise
long
before
dawn
to
help
little
morning
prepare
daily
a
stirrup
cup
of
whiskey
for
the
fox
hunt
was
one
of
my
most
important
chores
and
nearly
always
the
last
to
retire
and
the
fact
that
i
was
up
and
about
at
a
truly
unearthly
hour
was
the
only
reason
that
caused
me
one
morning
between
ball
and
hunt
to
nearly
stumble
over
miss
emmeline
and
someone
else
in
the
moonless
and
murky
dark
it
was
not
the
loud
whisper
of
her
voice
that
shocked
me
so
much
though
i
instantly
distinguished
it
but
the
lord
s
name
in
her
mouth
uttered
in
a
heard
blasphemy
on
a
woman
s
tongue
and
so
astonished
was
i
by
the
words
that
as
i
stood
there
rooted
in
the
dark
it
did
not
just
then
occur
to
me
to
consider
the
event
which
occasioned
them
and
i
thought
she
was
in
some
great
and
nameless
peril
oh
mercy
oh
god
oh
jesus
wait
oh
jesus
now
wait
quick
put
it
back
now
then
slowly
oh
jesus
christ
slowly
wait
a
man
s
soft
groan
from
the
lawn
behind
the
hedge
now
made
me
aware
of
the
other
presence
and
i
remained
half
paralyzed
fascinated
yet
suddenly
sick
nearly
unto
death
at
the
sound
of
the
saviour
s
name
spoken
thus
as
if
he
had
been
stripped
shamelessly
naked
by
the
hot
urgency
of
her
lips
wait
wait
she
again
implored
and
a
gentle
sigh
came
from
the
man
s
throat
and
mercy
mercy
wait
now
slowly
oh
jesus
oh
christ
oh
christ
oh
yes
now
oh
mercy
mercy
mercy
abruptly
then
in
a
prolonged
and
dwindling
little
sob
the
voice
died
and
all
was
silent
and
i
could
hear
nothing
but
the
piping
of
frogs
in
the
millpond
and
a
dull
thumping
of
horses
against
the
stable
stalls
and
the
sound
of
my
own
heart
racing
madly
so
loud
that
i
thought
surely
it
must
be
heard
above
the
soughing
of
a
night
wind
in
the
sycamore
trees
i
stood
there
unable
to
move
my
spirit
a
shambles
from
chagrin
and
shock
and
fear
and
i
recall
thinking
wretchedly
this
is
what
comes
of
being
a
nigger
it
ai
nt
fair
if
i
was
nt
a
nigger
i
would
nt
find
out
about
things
i
do
nt
want
to
find
out
about
it
ai
nt
fair
then
impassioned
tremulous
oh
my
love
em
my
love
my
love
em
my
love
but
there
was
no
reply
from
miss
emmeline
and
time
crept
by
slowly
and
painfully
like
something
crippled
and
old
causing
my
mouth
to
go
dry
and
a
numbness
premonitory
with
the
clammy
touch
of
death
to
spread
a
tingling
chill
through
my
legs
and
thighs
at
last
i
heard
her
voice
again
placid
now
composed
but
edged
with
contempt
and
bitterness
finally
you
ve
accomplished
what
you
ve
been
after
for
ages
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
oh
em
my
love
my
love
he
whispered
let
me
stay
away
from
me
she
said
her
voice
rising
now
in
the
darkness
stay
away
from
me
do
you
hear
if
you
touch
me
if
you
say
another
word
to
me
i
ll
tell
papa
i
ll
tell
papa
and
he
ll
shoot
you
for
ravishing
your
own
cousin
protested
you
consented
to
oh
butler
to
a
bookstore
in
town
to
procure
a
complete
english
translation
of
xenophon
s
banquet
the
university
greek
faculty
to
locate
one
she
wondered
whether
her
reading
of
the
dialogue
helped
her
to
grasp
at
least
partially
the
goings
on
that
then
occurred
in
her
house
galled
by
reuben
s
neglect
and
wearied
with
the
interminably
long
evenings
amos
had
a
diabolical
inspiration
he
remembered
the
swedish
gardener
whose
principal
task
was
to
keep
the
rooms
of
the
great
house
supplied
with
flowers
from
his
nursery
recently
a
widower
he
lived
alone
in
servants
quarters
a
short
distance
down
the
ravine
and
his
appearance
was
striking
enough
that
amos
felt
he
would
have
graced
a
banquet
at
which
socrates
was
a
guest
more
becomingly
than
aristocratic
reuben
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
night
disturbing
mrs
masterson
who
took
the
boy
s
exiting
steps
for
those
of
her
grandson
s
return
from
carousing
amos
an
indian
bathrobe
thrown
over
his
pure
silk
scarlet
pajamas
carefully
adjusting
his
usual
nocturnal
erection
walked
confidently
to
the
swede
s
cottage
whistling
a
little
tune
at
the
door
he
knocked
loudly
and
waited
still
whistling
the
knocking
and
admitted
his
guest
through
sheer
astonishment
once
inside
amos
had
no
intention
of
leaving
again
for
he
had
got
chilled
through
and
through
from
the
raw
air
and
the
sight
of
bootes
rising
in
the
east
had
made
his
teeth
chatter
when
reuben
did
not
answer
her
imperious
is
that
finally
you
mrs
masterson
rose
threw
a
quilt
about
her
shoulders
and
opened
the
door
of
her
grandson
s
bedroom
surprised
at
the
absence
of
both
reuben
and
his
favorite
and
feeling
now
suddenly
a
bit
light
headed
she
sat
down
at
amos
s
desk
her
eyes
fell
on
a
half
finished
letter
the
boy
had
written
to
cousin
ida
under
this
letter
lay
a
handful
of
others
opened
and
thumb
printed
by
his
reading
bearing
an
indecipherable
illinois
postmark
with
the
sender
s
name
ida
henstridge
mrs
masterson
struggled
with
her
conscience
only
briefly
then
she
read
avidly
not
only
amos
s
unfinished
epistle
but
with
even
more
rapt
attention
all
those
cousin
ida
had
written
her
of
warm
air
brought
her
immediately
back
to
long
forgotten
thoughts
and
feelings
and
relationships
before
her
marriage
she
read
of
cousin
ida
blaming
herself
defending
herself
and
at
last
crying
out
against
amos
s
unjust
bitterness
and
accusations
against
his
lot
cousin
ida
begged
him
to
have
patience
trust
hope
to
thank
his
benefactors
even
though
he
could
not
stand
the
rich
as
exemplified
at
any
rate
by
reuben
and
the
old
lady
of
the
castle
she
begged
amos
to
put
up
with
the
shows
of
wealth
now
as
he
had
with
poverty
and
going
without
and
to
remember
he
was
a
man
and
that
meant
he
could
be
free
i
would
give
anything
sometimes
if
i
had
been
born
a
man
for
then
i
would
not
have
to
sit
here
and
wonder
where
my
next
dollar
was
coming
from
but
on
the
other
hand
i
would
not
be
the
mother
of
a
fine
son
like
you
and
that
makes
up
for
all
the
rest
dearest
amos
she
day
and
she
and
ida
had
told
the
tea
leaves
to
see
what
lay
in
store
for
amos
and
then
they
had
got
down
together
on
the
rag
rug
in
the
kitchen
and
prayed
that
things
would
go
better
for
him
in
the
future
but
if
they
do
nt
dear
amos
come
home
remember
the
welcome
sign
is
always
out
there
were
other
details
the
canary
had
died
and
she
would
nt
get
another
but
would
leave
the
cage
in
its
old
place
widow
martin
down
the
alley
had
taken
away
her
membership
in
the
church
because
of
her
disliking
the
new
preacher
s
wife
the
refinery
was
being
sued
by
the
town
for
its
failure
to
control
the
suffocating
fumes
and
bad
odors
it
let
loose
i
am
glad
she
concluded
mr
masterson
shows
you
such
strong
affection
and
interest
for
there
never
is
any
word
from
your
father
and
i
wonder
amos
if
maybe
he
is
nt
dead
having
read
all
the
letters
foreboding
and
sudden
extreme
giddiness
she
desperately
hoped
reuben
might
come
in
for
she
felt
too
weak
to
call
out
for
the
servants
then
her
eye
fell
on
a
slender
sheaf
of
pages
over
which
was
scrawled
visits
from
a
sleepwalker
she
read
uninterrruptedly
absorbed
for
an
hour
more
still
yawning
in
huge
paroxysms
the
swedish
gardner
sven
studied
his
late
caller
his
command
of
english
being
negligible
and
a
man
of
few
words
in
his
own
tongue
he
took
off
his
thick
slippers
and
curled
up
beside
his
self
invited
visitor
he
recognized
amos
as
the
guest
of
mr
masterson
and
in
his
bewildered
way
decided
that
owing
to
an
influx
of
guests
at
the
great
house
either
the
old
lady
or
master
reuben
himself
had
sent
the
boy
to
ease
the
overflow
after
the
light
was
extinguished
he
was
soon
put
to
a
different
view
of
matters
at
the
floodgate
of
affection
which
amos
stung
by
his
having
lost
daniel
haws
and
being
shut
up
away
from
everything
in
the
country
poured
out
love
by
his
wife
s
death
yielded
too
easily
after
the
first
appeasement
of
feeling
the
gardener
was
bold
enough
to
ask
why
amos
s
feet
were
so
hard
and
horny
for
he
could
not
help
comparing
them
to
his
wife
s
whose
toes
had
been
like
cotton
when
pressed
against
him
amos
explained
that
he
was
an
inveterate
walker
from
his
earliest
childhood
in
the
country
and
had
spent
most
of
his
time
in
chicago
on
the
streets
exploring
every
inch
of
the
city
afoot
at
this
the
gardener
with
a
certain
uneasy
superstitious
dread
in
his
voice
asked
if
the
boy
would
show
him
his
feet
amos
willingly
obliged
and
placed
his
toes
on
a
white
rug
that
lay
by
the
bed
the
gardener
who
slept
up
to
the
shan
as
the
evening
wore
further
on
subsequent
to
the
dessert
the
shan
grew
more
and
more
inclined
to
close
his
eyes
and
let
his
head
slump
forward
for
longer
and
longer
periods
of
time
good
party
he
muttered
between
snores
and
finally
elephants
are
no
damn
good
at
all
and
so
passed
to
sleep
and
could
not
be
awakened
his
kinsmen
did
not
see
fit
to
escort
him
home
at
this
time
because
of
the
fact
that
the
prince
s
physician
had
added
chloral
hydrate
to
their
wine
and
they
were
at
that
moment
sprawled
upon
the
floor
snoring
the
prince
s
chief
courtier
arranged
with
hawkana
for
their
accommodation
and
the
shan
himself
was
taken
to
siddhartha
s
suite
where
he
was
shortly
visited
by
the
physician
who
loosened
his
voice
tomorrow
afternoon
he
was
saying
you
will
be
prince
siddhartha
and
these
will
be
your
retainers
you
will
report
to
the
hall
of
karma
in
their
company
to
claim
there
the
body
which
brahma
has
promised
you
without
the
necessity
of
prior
judgment
you
will
remain
siddhartha
throughout
the
transfer
and
you
will
return
here
in
the
company
of
your
retainers
to
be
examined
by
me
do
you
understand
yes
whispered
the
shan
then
repeat
what
i
have
told
you
tomorrow
afternoon
said
the
shan
i
will
be
siddhartha
commanding
these
retainers
bright
bloomed
the
morning
and
debts
were
settled
beneath
it
half
of
the
prince
s
men
rode
out
of
the
city
heading
north
when
they
were
out
of
sight
of
mahartha
they
began
circling
to
the
southeast
working
their
way
through
the
hills
stopping
only
to
don
their
battle
gear
half
a
dozen
men
were
dispatched
to
the
street
of
the
contents
of
which
were
divided
into
the
pouches
of
three
dozen
men
who
departed
after
breakfast
into
the
city
the
prince
took
counsel
with
his
physician
narada
saying
if
i
have
misjudged
the
clemency
of
heaven
then
am
i
cursed
indeed
but
the
doctor
smiled
and
replied
i
doubt
you
misjudged
and
so
they
passed
from
morning
into
the
still
center
of
day
the
ridge
of
the
gods
golden
above
them
when
their
charges
awakened
they
ministered
to
their
hangovers
the
shan
was
given
a
posthypnotic
and
sent
with
six
of
siddhartha
s
retainers
to
the
palace
of
the
masters
his
kinsmen
were
assured
that
he
remained
sleeping
in
the
prince
s
quarters
our
major
risk
at
this
point
said
the
physician
is
the
shan
will
he
be
recognized
the
factors
in
our
favor
are
that
he
is
a
minor
potentate
from
a
distant
kingdom
he
has
only
been
in
town
for
a
short
period
of
time
has
spent
most
of
that
himself
for
judgment
the
masters
should
still
be
unaware
of
your
own
physical
appearance
unless
i
have
been
described
to
them
by
brahma
or
his
priest
said
the
prince
for
all
i
know
my
communication
may
have
been
taped
and
the
tape
relayed
to
them
for
identification
purposes
why
though
should
this
have
been
done
inquired
narada
they
should
hardly
expect
stealth
and
elaborate
precautions
of
one
for
whom
they
are
doing
a
favor
no
i
think
we
should
be
able
to
pull
it
off
the
shan
would
not
be
able
to
pass
a
probe
of
course
hut
he
should
pass
surface
scrutiny
accompanied
as
he
is
by
your
retainers
at
the
moment
he
does
believe
he
is
siddhartha
and
he
could
pass
any
simple
lie
detection
test
in
that
regard
which
i
feel
is
the
most
serious
obstacle
he
might
encounter
so
they
waited
and
the
three
dozen
men
returned
with
empty
pouches
gathered
their
belongings
mounted
town
as
though
in
search
of
revelry
but
actually
drifting
slowly
in
a
southeasterly
direction
good
bye
good
hawkana
said
the
prince
as
the
remainder
of
his
men
packed
and
mounted
i
shall
bear
as
always
good
report
of
your
lodgings
to
all
whom
i
meet
about
the
land
i
regret
that
my
stay
here
must
be
so
unexpectedly
terminated
but
i
must
ride
to
put
down
an
uprising
in
the
provinces
as
soon
as
i
leave
the
hall
of
karma
you
are
aware
of
how
these
things
spring
up
the
moment
a
ruler
s
back
is
turned
so
while
i
should
have
liked
to
spend
another
week
beneath
your
roof
i
fear
that
this
pleasure
must
be
postponed
until
another
time
if
any
ask
after
me
tell
them
to
seek
me
in
hades
hades
my
lord
it
is
the
southernmost
province
of
my
kingdom
noted
for
its
excessively
warm
weather
be
sure
to
phrase
it
just
so
especially
to
the
priests
whereabouts
in
days
to
come
i
ll
do
that
my
lord
and
take
especial
care
of
the
boy
dele
i
expect
to
hear
him
play
again
on
my
next
visit
hawkana
bowed
low
and
was
about
to
begin
a
speech
so
the
prince
decided
upon
that
moment
to
toss
him
the
final
bag
of
coins
and
make
an
additional
comment
as
to
the
wines
of
urath
before
mounting
quickly
and
shouting
orders
to
his
men
in
such
a
manner
as
to
drown
out
any
further
conversation
then
they
rode
through
the
gateway
and
were
gone
leaving
behind
only
the
physician
and
three
warriors
whom
he
was
to
treat
an
additional
day
for
an
obscure
condition
having
to
do
with
the
change
of
climate
before
they
rode
on
to
catch
up
with
the
others
they
passed
through
the
town
using
side
streets
and
came
after
a
time
to
the
roadway
that
led
up
toward
the
palace
of
the
masters
of
karma
as
they
passed
along
its
length
siddhartha
exchanged
secret
in
hiding
at
various
points
off
in
the
woods
when
they
had
gone
half
the
distance
to
the
palace
the
prince
and
the
eight
men
who
accompanied
him
drew
rein
and
made
as
if
to
rest
waiting
the
while
for
the
others
to
move
abreast
of
them
passing
carefully
among
the
trees
before
long
however
they
saw
movement
on
the
the
street
in
order
not
to
look
at
the
people
on
the
bus
i
wondered
how
we
were
ever
going
to
fox
them
if
we
could
nt
even
into
the
eyes
of
a
red
faced
black
haired
corpulent
man
who
had
briefly
and
idly
looked
up
from
his
newspaper
his
hair
was
very
well
combed
his
face
was
very
well
shaven
his
nails
were
manicured
his
shoes
gleamed
his
suit
and
his
topcoat
were
expensive
he
was
wearing
cufflinks
and
i
could
almost
smell
his
toilet
water
i
do
nt
know
what
was
in
my
eyes
base
envy
i
think
base
hatred
and
great
wonder
but
whatever
it
was
held
his
wandering
not
altogether
hostile
nor
altogether
amused
attention
for
a
second
or
so
he
glanced
at
my
brother
then
he
returned
to
his
newspaper
then
all
of
my
ambitions
seemed
flat
and
ridiculous
how
could
we
fox
them
if
we
could
neither
bear
to
look
at
them
nor
bear
it
when
they
looked
at
us
and
who
were
they
anyway
which
was
the
really
terrible
the
boomeranging
question
and
one
always
felt
maybe
they
re
right
maybe
you
are
nothing
or
the
life
they
make
you
lead
is
the
only
life
you
deserve
they
say
that
god
said
so
and
if
god
said
so
then
you
mean
about
as
much
to
god
as
you
do
to
this
red
faced
black
haired
fat
white
man
fuck
god
fuck
you
too
mister
but
there
he
sat
just
the
same
impervious
gleaming
and
redolent
with
safety
rustling
as
it
were
the
scriptures
in
which
i
appeared
only
as
the
object
lesson
we
got
off
the
bus
near
madison
square
garden
i
think
the
circus
was
in
town
for
the
garden
was
surrounded
by
policemen
and
the
streets
were
full
of
dazzledmen
and
women
and
children
the
streets
were
full
of
a
noise
like
gaiety
but
one
realized
that
it
could
not
be
gaiety
when
one
looked
at
the
thin
lips
and
the
flashing
spectacles
the
crisply
toasted
curled
hair
of
the
ladies
when
one
listened
to
the
brutal
denigrating
lewd
voices
of
the
men
and
watched
their
stretched
lips
cunning
tyrannical
wail
of
the
children
vaguely
and
vocally
dissatisfiedby
the
fair
and
when
one
watched
the
policemen
who
moved
through
the
crowd
on
foot
or
on
horseback
as
though
the
crowd
were
cattle
there
were
no
movies
on
this
avenue
and
so
we
turned
off
it
walking
east
moving
now
with
now
against
the
current
sometimes
separated
by
it
often
stopped
sometimes
in
searching
for
each
other
spun
around
people
looked
into
storewindows
and
so
did
we
walked
in
and
out
of
stores
but
we
did
nt
bother
and
they
were
visible
behind
the
plate
glass
windows
of
cafeterias
sitting
in
my
memory
bolt
upright
or
wandering
about
with
trays
the
crowd
no
doubt
would
have
described
itself
as
friendly
a
fair
observation
would
have
been
that
they
were
in
a
holiday
mood
but
their
holidays
were
emphatically
not
my
holidays
i
had
too
often
been
the
occasion
of
their
fearful
celebrations
and
i
did
not
feel
any
friendliness
and
a
mortal
danger
i
kept
my
hands
in
my
pockets
and
so
did
caleb
so
i
could
not
be
accused
of
molesting
any
of
the
women
who
jostled
past
and
kept
my
eyes
carefully
expression
less
so
i
could
not
be
accused
of
lusting
after
the
women
or
desiring
the
death
of
the
men
when
my
countrymen
were
on
holiday
their
exuberance
took
strange
forms
and
i
was
aware
for
the
first
time
though
not
for
the
last
that
i
was
with
caleb
whose
danger
since
he
was
so
much
more
visible
was
greater
than
mine
it
was
not
here
and
not
now
and
not
among
these
people
that
he
could
protect
me
by
his
size
on
the
contrary
our
roles
were
reversed
and
here
now
among
these
people
it
was
my
size
and
my
presumed
innocence
which
might
operate
as
protection
for
him
he
was
not
walking
beside
me
a
burly
black
man
prowling
the
streets
but
an
attentive
older
brother
taking
his
little
brother
sightseeing
envied
metropolis
of
new
york
my
presence
potentially
at
least
proved
his
innocence
and
goodwill
and
also
bore
witness
to
the
charity
and
splendor
of
the
people
to
whom
i
owed
so
much
and
from
whom
i
had
so
much
to
learn
we
came
to
broadway
and
the
great
marquees
you
going
to
have
your
name
up
there
in
lights
little
leo
caleb
asked
with
a
smile
yes
i
said
i
will
you
wait
and
see
little
leo
said
caleb
on
the
great
white
way
it
wo
nt
be
so
white
i
said
when
i
get
through
with
it
caleb
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
people
turned
to
look
at
us
but
i
made
my
eyes
very
big
as
i
looked
up
at
caleb
and
carefully
not
at
them
and
they
saw
what
i
had
wanted
them
to
see
some
of
them
smiled
too
happy
that
we
were
enjoying
what
movie
you
want
us
to
see
and
i
will
bow
to
your
judgment
man
because
i
see
you
are
becomingan
expert
well
in
fact
i
realized
as
i
scanned
the
procession
of
marquees
there
was
nt
anything
playing
that
i
was
really
dying
to
see
i
had
outgrown
my
taste
for
some
movies
without
having
acquired
any
real
taste
for
others
but
of
course
i
did
not
know
how
to
say
this
i
had
begun
to
be
interested
in
foreign
movies
mostly
russian
and
french
but
i
did
nt
think
that
caleb
would
especially
like
seeing
a
foreign
movie
so
i
said
well
let
s
look
if
you
see
something
you
like
before
i
see
something
i
like
why
we
ll
go
and
see
that
and
if
i
see
something
i
like
before
you
see
something
you
like
why
we
ll
go
and
see
that
okay
okay
he
said
amused
seeming
also
to
we
wandered
through
the
holiday
crowds
stopping
now
beneath
this
marquee
ever
forget
he
was
older
than
she
a
slim
spectacled
man
of
no
particular
coloring
but
rather
a
male
man
she
suspected
and
so
she
merely
smiled
driving
herself
early
the
next
morning
along
the
parkway
toward
new
hampshire
however
it
occurred
to
her
that
one
of
her
difficulties
perhaps
was
that
indeed
she
never
moment
of
the
hours
she
had
spent
with
kim
christopher
nor
could
she
forget
the
changing
looks
upon
his
too
expressive
face
his
disappointment
when
he
found
that
he
was
not
to
be
with
his
father
his
brave
silence
and
the
glitter
of
tears
in
his
eyes
no
her
absorption
in
her
work
these
last
two
days
had
not
made
her
forget
the
boy
s
urgent
need
and
not
forgetting
she
had
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
consciously
and
willfully
deceived
chris
chris
she
had
said
last
night
over
the
telephone
i
sha
nt
come
home
tomorrow
as
i
had
planned
i
am
staying
on
another
two
or
three
days
you
ll
be
late
for
the
fourth
he
exclaimed
no
i
sha
nt
be
i
ll
get
in
not
a
moment
later
than
the
midnight
of
the
third
possibly
the
second
and
be
worn
out
the
next
day
not
worn
out
the
next
day
he
had
yielded
to
her
words
of
love
how
right
her
decision
had
been
was
clear
to
her
now
after
the
long
quiet
day
of
driving
alone
she
had
finished
her
task
at
the
laboratories
leaving
with
her
colleagues
a
brief
clear
statement
of
her
conclusions
and
with
peace
in
her
mind
the
peace
that
only
completed
work
well
done
could
bring
her
she
had
turned
her
inner
attention
to
the
matter
of
kim
christopher
slowly
as
the
hours
passed
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
situation
could
no
longer
be
allowed
to
hang
fire
the
boy
must
either
join
them
as
chris
s
son
or
she
would
take
him
back
to
korea
and
his
mother
that
is
if
she
could
so
persuade
chris
her
mind
quieted
by
at
least
this
much
decision
she
drew
in
at
sunset
to
the
grounds
of
the
waite
school
for
boys
she
had
purposely
not
announced
her
coming
she
wanted
to
see
christopher
as
he
was
without
the
preliminary
excitement
of
expecting
her
arrival
she
wanted
to
come
upon
him
wherever
evening
meal
she
stopped
at
the
main
building
a
colonial
structure
of
white
painted
wood
with
green
shutters
at
the
windows
and
rang
the
bell
an
older
boy
answered
it
is
dr
bartlett
here
she
asked
he
s
still
in
his
office
i
think
but
he
s
just
about
to
go
home
probably
catch
him
for
me
please
she
said
tell
him
it
is
mrs
chris
winters
she
had
lingered
in
the
hall
only
a
moment
when
she
saw
dr
bartlett
loping
toward
her
his
long
stride
hastened
by
the
surprise
evident
on
his
face
mrs
winters
he
cried
is
something
wrong
no
she
explained
simply
that
i
thought
i
d
drop
by
and
see
how
christopher
is
doing
very
well
very
well
he
said
come
in
i
ll
send
for
him
may
i
just
go
to
him
wherever
he
is
i
d
speak
they
found
him
in
the
library
otherwise
empty
at
this
hour
there
on
a
window
seat
catching
the
last
of
the
evening
light
he
was
reading
a
large
book
upon
the
sill
christopher
here
is
a
surprise
for
you
the
headmaster
said
he
looked
up
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
thin
much
thinner
than
he
had
been
but
when
he
leaped
to
his
feet
she
saw
also
that
he
was
much
taller
you
come
to
see
me
he
breathed
to
her
horror
he
hesitated
and
then
leaning
his
head
against
her
shoulder
he
began
to
weep
she
put
her
arms
around
him
and
held
him
and
turned
a
reproachful
look
upon
the
surprised
dr
bartlett
has
he
been
unhappy
the
boy
answered
for
himself
he
lifted
his
head
and
smiled
through
the
tears
wet
on
his
face
i
am
happy
now
he
said
you
come
to
see
me
thank
you
he
s
course
there
has
been
some
depression
after
all
it
s
a
strange
country
for
him
and
in
a
manner
you
and
mr
winters
are
still
strangers
to
him
they
had
not
told
him
who
the
boy
was
and
though
it
must
have
been
evident
to
the
eyes
of
a
wise
headmaster
no
questions
had
been
asked
and
so
no
answers
were
necessary
should
she
tell
him
the
truth
later
when
they
were
alone
he
was
still
talking
you
must
nt
take
these
tears
too
seriously
mrs
winters
i
ve
been
several
times
in
asia
and
indeed
spent
months
in
japan
during
the
occupation
and
i
remember
that
it
is
not
thought
a
disgrace
in
asia
for
a
man
to
weep
rather
it
is
considered
a
sign
of
sensitivity
and
feeling
our
christopher
has
both
these
attributes
i
have
discovered
of
course
he
has
problems
perhaps
we
ll
discuss
it
she
said
with
resolution
meanwhile
can
you
put
me
up
for
the
night
room
christopher
sup
pose
you
take
her
to
the
east
room
and
then
you
may
bring
her
to
dinner
with
you
i
ll
have
your
bag
brought
in
mrs
winters
now
i
ll
leave
you
with
your
boy
after
all
it
is
he
you
came
to
visit
he
left
them
and
she
was
touched
that
christopher
did
not
feel
himself
too
old
to
clasp
her
hand
as
they
went
down
the
hall
noisy
with
crowding
boys
turning
eastwarddown
a
corridor
he
opened
a
door
and
followed
her
into
the
room
a
pleasant
place
she
observed
all
chintz
and
white
organdy
she
sat
down
in
a
cushioned
chair
and
putting
out
her
hand
she
drew
the
boy
to
her
side
now
let
me
see
you
she
said
you
are
tall
you
are
thin
do
you
eat
enough
he
nodded
suddenly
shy
to
her
surprise
she
saw
his
eyes
fill
again
with
grasp
of
hard
realities
as
the
liberal
democrats
in
spite
of
himself
he
had
had
a
feeling
of
relief
that
day
when
the
questioning
shifted
south
and
to
the
republicans
when
one
of
the
latter
said
doctor
about
this
watchful
waiting
it
does
nt
mean
that
you
will
just
sit
on
your
asses
down
there
strike
that
i
mean
duffs
until
the
communists
take
over
does
it
the
assistant
secretary
had
allowed
himself
a
responding
smile
and
assured
the
senator
it
did
not
he
had
been
equally
grateful
for
the
next
question
doctor
can
you
tell
me
from
your
experience
if
it
is
a
well
organized
tactic
of
the
communist
conspiracy
to
begin
by
getting
control
of
the
educational
system
and
the
police
worth
campbell
this
had
certainly
been
a
pattern
there
was
nothing
rigid
about
communist
tactics
on
the
next
question
however
he
had
applied
the
brakes
doctor
i
appreciate
your
having
to
be
careful
in
this
matter
now
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
this
country
this
new
man
mire
has
put
two
well
known
and
proclaimed
communists
in
charge
of
education
and
the
police
the
questioner
had
permitted
himself
a
glance
at
his
col
leagues
there
had
been
the
slight
hush
that
always
marks
the
really
significant
question
i
think
it
would
be
premature
senator
to
say
that
they
are
proclaimed
communists
campbell
had
replied
then
measuring
his
words
he
had
continued
i
can
tell
you
that
we
are
keeping
the
situation
under
very
close
scrutiny
very
close
i
certainly
can
say
we
are
concerned
even
o
donnell
who
was
along
was
agreeably
surprised
at
his
cautious
tone
had
the
committee
called
o
donnell
to
the
witness
chair
they
would
have
received
a
different
and
not
did
not
contemplate
nor
did
o
donnell
expect
it
god
is
known
to
assign
intelligence
somewhat
at
random
but
in
the
united
states
government
godless
and
god
fearing
agree
that
it
must
be
exploited
strictly
in
accordance
with
official
rank
in
the
weeks
following
the
senate
hearing
puerto
santos
passed
from
the
news
and
according
to
worth
campbell
s
calculation
the
extent
of
the
danger
thus
further
increased
as
opportunity
presented
itself
he
warned
of
the
continuing
danger
one
excellent
chance
presented
itself
when
pethwick
was
invited
to
attend
an
off
the
record
session
of
the
council
on
foreign
relations
in
new
york
the
policy
was
to
keep
pethwick
under
wraps
his
past
commitment
to
martinez
invited
questions
however
well
answered
which
in
the
case
of
pethwick
could
not
be
guaranteed
the
questions
reminded
people
of
things
that
could
usefully
be
forgotten
campbell
had
the
invitation
shifted
to
himself
he
also
enjoyed
attending
meetings
of
the
council
like
all
meetings
this
was
in
the
council
s
headquarters
in
the
harold
pratt
house
on
park
avenue
the
pratts
were
nearly
the
monopoly
of
standard
oil
and
the
first
rockefeller
the
terms
were
magnificent
and
so
accordingly
is
the
house
that
harold
pratt
built
in
so
especially
is
the
library
with
its
handsome
portraits
of
past
leaders
of
american
foreign
policy
deep
rugs
gleaming
mahogany
and
two
towering
floors
of
bookshelves
with
a
gallery
surrounding
the
second
it
was
here
rather
than
in
a
larger
room
that
this
meeting
was
held
puerto
santos
enlists
the
interest
only
of
the
more
devoted
members
the
devoted
membership
of
the
council
includes
a
few
columbia
university
professors
and
a
number
of
former
under
secretaries
and
assistant
secretaries
of
the
departments
of
state
and
defense
for
whom
it
continues
a
nostalgic
association
with
an
experience
that
all
found
more
exciting
although
financially
less
remunerative
than
the
practice
of
law
to
which
they
have
since
reluctantly
returned
it
also
includes
a
larger
number
of
lawyers
and
business
executives
with
no
washington
experience
who
are
genuinely
interested
in
foreign
affairs
or
who
feel
guilty
about
their
primary
preoccupation
with
making
money
or
who
hope
to
inform
themselves
of
developments
yet
unknown
to
the
public
hope
to
secure
new
clients
or
make
useful
friends
those
who
seek
information
are
of
some
slight
concern
to
the
elder
statesmen
of
the
council
for
there
is
a
question
whether
public
officials
should
provide
them
in
confidence
with
intelligence
that
other
and
equally
necessitous
lawyers
or
executives
are
not
allowed
to
hear
nor
do
they
like
to
rely
on
the
obvious
justification
which
is
that
little
information
of
any
novelty
is
ever
imparted
this
sadly
is
the
case
speeches
or
articles
on
foreign
policy
almost
never
depend
for
their
interest
on
their
contents
they
almost
always
depend
on
the
importance
of
the
author
naturally
not
much
is
missed
by
those
who
are
not
allowed
to
hear
an
authoritative
exposition
of
the
already
known
in
his
mature
years
worth
campbell
had
found
the
council
a
great
aid
to
morale
at
the
university
at
the
white
house
now
in
the
senate
and
in
the
persons
of
bill
o
donnell
joe
hurd
and
other
younger
foreign
serviceofficers
he
had
found
that
unclarity
of
view
about
communismand
the
cold
war
which
increasingly
had
blighted
reassurance
it
was
still
dominated
almost
as
an
alumni
association
by
the
men
who
served
with
him
in
berlin
and
paris
or
under
dulles
they
understood
and
accepted
as
did
worth
campbell
the
clear
lessons
of
their
own
experience
they
mistrusted
those
who
were
not
similarly
qualified
perhaps
some
younger
men
had
doubts
they
did
not
voice
them
for
naturally
they
wanted
to
establish
the
kind
of
confidence
among
their
elders
that
produces
friends
or
even
clients
in
this
sympathetic
environment
worth
campbell
had
warned
frankly
about
madera
and
ryan
and
the
ability
of
mire
to
control
them
he
reminded
his
audience
of
the
pattern
of
past
communist
tactics
and
added
his
purely
personal
opinion
that
the
two
cabinet
officers
were
biding
their
time
this
meant
that
puerto
santos
was
still
a
trouble
spot
he
spoke
of
the
unwisdom
of
taking
at
face
value
some
of
the
newspaper
accounts
now
coming
out
of
puerto
santos
most
of
those
present
he
felt
would
suppose
to
proceed
to
the
village
the
original
meeting
place
proposed
by
general
ham
when
general
mah
came
back
to
our
headquarters
from
the
american
command
he
wanted
to
revise
the
plan
and
now
wanted
me
not
to
contact
generalalm
that
is
he
did
nt
want
general
alm
to
be
at
the
rendezvous
he
would
not
explain
why
and
he
is
not
accustomed
to
having
his
subordinates
question
his
motives
colonel
jung
said
then
does
this
mean
you
have
nt
alerted
colonel
hwang
of
the
airborne
his
paratroopers
where
are
they
now
as
far
as
general
alm
is
concerned
take
place
he
knows
that
it
will
take
place
sometime
tonight
of
course
from
my
point
of
view
since
he
will
not
have
time
to
move
his
commandos
out
of
seoul
even
if
he
found
out
about
the
rendezvous
now
and
even
if
he
did
he
would
nt
know
where
to
have
them
go
i
thought
it
unnecessary
to
mobilize
the
paratroopers
we
have
enough
men
out
here
as
it
is
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
colonel
jung
so
you
are
not
expecting
general
alm
i
would
nt
be
too
sure
of
that
said
colonel
min
no
you
are
right
said
colonel
son
you
can
never
be
sure
of
anything
with
general
mah
do
nt
forget
he
still
has
a
hatful
of
tricks
left
one
thing
we
can
be
sure
of
though
is
that
general
ahn
s
commandos
are
not
going
to
show
up
anywhere
tonight
actually
it
saves
much
time
and
trouble
for
us
now
after
i
talk
with
him
on
radio
he
will
arrive
here
let
us
say
in
ten
minutes
he
should
if
he
is
going
to
appear
at
all
when
he
comes
he
will
ask
to
see
general
ham
well
he
will
know
he
is
not
here
i
will
have
to
say
something
to
him
about
that
now
then
what
what
do
we
do
after
that
you
d
better
leave
it
to
me
from
that
point
on
said
colonel
min
i
ll
do
the
talking
all
right
just
give
us
the
word
said
colonel
son
i
checked
my
watch
again
one
minute
to
eleven
it
s
time
i
said
all
right
said
colonel
min
let
s
get
this
over
with
we
all
walked
over
to
colonel
son
s
jeep
there
was
no
driver
he
had
driven
out
himself
colonel
son
radioed
have
you
caught
the
rat
have
no
but
i
have
caught
the
fox
no
but
i
have
caught
the
fox
is
that
his
voice
said
colonel
jung
colonel
min
nodded
it
is
colonel
son
turned
his
shadowy
face
to
colonel
min
colonel
min
whispered
all
right
go
ahead
colonel
son
radioed
back
bring
the
fox
bring
the
fox
he
waited
for
a
few
moments
then
switched
off
the
radio
colonel
jung
said
i
d
better
go
and
stay
with
my
men
i
will
be
over
there
behind
the
bushes
i
ve
piled
sandbags
there
colonel
son
so
if
you
need
a
cover
just
run
for
it
i
ll
move
your
jeep
he
started
the
jeep
good
luck
he
drove
the
jeep
to
the
northern
edge
of
the
runway
in
the
center
of
it
reversed
the
jeep
so
that
it
faced
the
western
entrance
to
the
airstrip
turn
all
the
lights
on
running
toward
us
sorry
colonel
min
i
forgot
all
about
the
searchlights
i
have
two
searchlights
set
up
and
ready
how
could
i
have
forgotten
about
that
one
is
halfway
up
the
hill
beyond
the
western
entrance
and
the
other
one
is
up
there
beyond
the
bush
so
if
the
searchlights
go
on
do
nt
be
alarmed
they
are
ours
the
special
agents
had
been
gathered
by
colonel
min
he
said
to
everyone
we
have
a
change
of
plan
when
i
want
you
to
fire
i
ll
do
what
i
told
you
before
i
ll
clasp
my
hands
behind
my
back
three
seconds
i
ll
drop
down
to
the
ground
we
will
turn
off
all
the
lights
out
here
and
colonel
jung
you
ll
have
your
searchlights
turned
on
is
that
clear
colonel
jung
said
to
the
senior
agent

to
his
position
behind
the
bushes
i
do
nt
see
the
l
said
colonel
son
it
s
up
there
somewhere
said
colonel
min
it
was
suddenly
still
and
hushed
the
see
only
the
dim
shreds
of
light
through
the
clouds
the
air
was
warm
and
damp
colonel
min
said
quietly
to
me
when
general
mah
s
sedan
or
whatever
he
is
going
to
be
in
appears
colonel

wait
till

toward
general
mah
and
at
that
point
i

you
to
get

and
with
a
submachine

minute
any
second
the
temperature
will
drop
it
must
the
main
thing
is
to
stop
thinking
tell
me
how
you
ca
nt
switch
off
a
brain
the
way
you
do
a
fan
what
walter
and
i
had
talked
about
kept
my
brain
spinning
it
could
change
my
life
and
none
too
soon
it
might
even
change
the
world
and
in
this
year
of
change
was
overdue
for
the
better
i
mean
walter
s
plan
made
sense
it
might
lead
to
bigger
things
a
pebble
tossed
into
a
pond
sends
its
ripples
far
i
kept
smelling
smoke
i
got
up
again
to
sniff
the
hall
must
be
the
tar
i
m
smelling
or
the
firecrackers
i
switched
the
fan
on
once
more
the
grinding
racket
bothered
me
and
that
smell
of
smoke
the
third
time
i
climbed
out
of
bed
i
caught
an
orange
glow
reflected
on
my
propped
up
window
pane
and
when
i
leaned
across
the
sill
i
saw
flames
up
the
street
i
ran
downstairs
to
the
phone
shouted
to
the
operator
fire
weiss
s
building
one
oh
three
sixth
street
leaped
upstairs
yanked
on
my
pajama
bottoms
the
alarm
siren
was
wailing
while
i
ran
without
glasses
barefoot
tar
sticking
to
my
soles
up
the
street
toward
the
grocery
at
an
upstairs
window
i
saw
a
white
shadow
maybe
herman
maybe
myopic
distortion
then
gray
smoke
billowed
past
the
window
and
all
i
saw
was
smoke
and
tongues
of
bright
red
flame
licking
the
parched
side
walls
and
the
porch
of
herman
s
grocery
a
the
hill
at
the
hydrant
on
the
corner
firemen
sweated
swore
connecting
the
hose
the
pressure
was
low
just
a
trickle
ran
hurry
crissake
hurry
i
begged
a
man
s
trapped
in
there
jack
jones
the
fire
chief
a
brave
man
dashed
across
the
burning
porch
and
drove
his
axe
into
the
staircase
door
splintering
it
open
dense
smoke
rolling
down
forced
him
back
but
i
d
seen
herman
up
and
she
looked
at
him
with
both
a
child
s
hurt
and
an
old
woman
s
severity
i
do
nt
need
a
rest
she
said
things
are
nt
getting
too
much
for
me
he
started
to
protest
but
instead
his
impatience
with
her
getting
the
better
of
him
he
jumped
up
and
strode
across
to
the
small
kerosene
stove
on
its
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
had
only
just
started
the
preparations
for
the
coffee
when
he
entered
and
he
noisily
completed
them
her
and
his
tight
shoulders
shutting
her
out
when
it
was
done
he
brought
a
cup
of
the
coffee
over
to
her
his
face
as
he
held
it
out
was
somber
and
closed
and
when
she
sought
his
eyes
wanting
to
express
her
remorse
to
make
apology
she
found
them
veiled
distant
i
suspect
you
re
thinking
you
were
right
after
all
and
it
was
nt
such
a
good
idea
to
bring
me
along
she
spoke
after
a
long
silence
he
made
no
answer
only
sat
frowning
down
into
the
small
black
pool
of
coffee
in
his
cup
which
he
held
cradled
between
his
palms
as
if
he
needed
its
reassuring
warmth
how
was
the
house
raising
she
spoke
after
another
silence
his
head
remained
bent
a
little
longer
over
the
cup
and
then
he
said
hard
work
but
fun
and
very
beautiful
in
a
way
the
house
is
only
one
room
scarcely
bigger
than
a
closet
but
a
house
nonetheless
the
man
to
whom
it
stinger
was
years
accumulating
the
money
just
to
buy
the
lumber
the
next
thing
he
s
planning
to
do
now
that
it
s
up
is
to
get
married
he
s
been
going
with
a
woman
from
drake
hill
who
has
a
couple
of
kids
for
him
and
they
ll
be
getting
married
now
that
s
slightly
the
reverse
of
things
is
nt
it
she
said
with
a
cautious
laugh
first
having
your
family
and
then
getting
married
i
guess
he
said
but
in
bournehills
a
man
does
nt
believe
in
making
it
legal
until
he
can
at
least
offer
his
wife
a
house
of
her
own
no
matter
how
small
it
s
their
way
and
as
valid
in
the
final
analysis
as
any
other
he
paused
a
slow
smile
taking
shape
you
should
have
seen
cox
he
was
so
happy
poor
guy
especially
when
he
saw
the
roof
going
up
that
he
drank
too
much
and
passed
out
on
us
we
then
the
smile
giving
way
to
the
subtle
sadness
and
irony
that
was
so
much
a
part
of
him
he
said
musing
it
aloud
it
s
so
little
for
a
man
to
ask
of
life
a
closet
of
a
house
that
ll
start
falling
apart
on
him
in
no
time
yet
it
s
the
world
to
someone
here
so
that
things
being
relative
cox
could
see
himself
as
a
man
who
had
succeeded
at
his
life
and
he
did
at
least
for
the
time
the
house
was
going
up
i
saw
it
in
his
face
and
i
m
afraid
i
also
got
a
little
drunk
as
a
result
oh
hatt
he
said
his
tone
his
smile
setting
all
to
rights
between
them
again
i
know
i
shall
probably
fall
victim
again
to
my
emotions
and
get
too
involved
a
defect
i
m
known
for
but
i
m
beginning
to
feel
so
at
home
here
in
bournehills
it
s
as
though
i
ve
lived
in
the
harriet
heard
this
not
without
a
twinge
of
resentment
she
was
helpless
to
suppress
and
i
so
love
you
she
said
after
having
looked
for
weeks
vere
at
last
found
the
car
he
wanted
it
was
a
much
used
but
fairly
late
model
opel
kapitan
the
car
made
by
the
general
motors
subsidiary
in
germany
which
combines
features
drawn
from
both
countries
on
one
hand
a
high
powered
german
motor
on
the
other
a
long
sleek
low
slung
american
body
that
in
motion
going
very
fast
looks
like
some
powerful
animal
leaping
forward
to
strike
it
was
the
body
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
that
decided
vere
the
opel
had
been
badly
damaged
in
an
accident
and
with
its
crumpled
fenders
and
generally
battered
hull
looked
fit
only
for
the
scrap
heap
but
vere
his
head
cocked
thoughtfully
to
one
side
examined
it
with
an
expert
s
eye
he
tried
the
motor
sitting
tensed
forward
over
the
steering
wheel
listening
to
it
as
he
fed
it
the
gas
nod
and
purchased
it
on
the
spot
he
brought
it
like
a
bride
home
to
bournehills
with
allen
behind
in
the
ford
giving
him
an
assist
on
the
upgrades
and
nudging
him
into
motion
whenever
the
motor
failed
he
gently
coaxed
the
opel
over
the
hills
to
spiretown
and
finally
down
the
low
embankment
into
the
yard
adjoining
leesy
s
house
near
wreck
that
it
was
it
immediately
became
part
of
the
ancient
wreckage
in
the
yard
including
the
ragged
mango
and
calabash
trees
the
torn
galvanized
fence
the
wattle
and
daub
pen
that
housed
the
sow
leesy
was
planning
to
have
butchered
at
carnival
and
the
ramshackle
cart
she
used
for
haulingpher
canes
to
the
factory
it
was
instantly
at
home
with
the
bad
tempered
fowls
who
fought
each
other
over
the
scraps
tossed
them
from
the
doorway
and
the
donkey
standing
abject
and
morose
near
the
cactus
bush
where
the
wash
was
hung
to
dry
the
day
vere
brought
the
opel
home
the
donkey
had
slowly
raised
its
head
and
its
blank
eyes
filled
with
the
sunlight
its
deep
sucking
groans
that
were
like
sounds
uttered
during
some
protracted
and
painful
coitus
the
cry
ended
it
had
resumed
its
pose
of
profound
dejection
and
never
again
acknowledged
the
car
nor
did
leesy
ever
really
acknowledge
it
she
never
went
near
it
but
would
move
about
the
yard
at
her
chores
as
if
unaware
of
its
presence
during
the
day
when
she
came
to
the
doorway
to
check
the
sun
or
this
door
and
tried
to
ambush
me
and
i
told
you
watch
out
how
you
talk
i
do
nt
believe
a
goddam
word
you
say
tuttle
shouted
and
blew
a
spray
of
saliva
in
ferguson
s
eyes
that
s
what
i
think
of
what
you
say
why
you
little
prick
ferguson
reached
for
his
gun
but
before
he
could
get
it
out
of
the
holster
tuttle
brought
the
butt
of
his
machine
gun
doubled
over
tuttle
dropped
the
machine
gun
and
jumped
on
ferguson
and
the
two
men
toppled
to
the
ground
and
rolled
in
the
dust
each
trying
for
a
firm
grip
on
the
the
four
enlisted
men
two
of
them
with
their
hands
full
of
by
now
exhausted
chickens
watched
in
stunned
silence
the
spectacle
of
two
officers
fighting
in
the
dust
they
had
heard
officers
snap
at
each
other
before
and
make
remarks
behind
each
other
s
backs
but
they
had
never
seen
them
come
to
blows
such
a
thing
was
one
of
the
cardinal
sins
of
the
rule
book
and
in
his
wildest
dreams
nobody
had
ever
expected
to
see
it
happen
they
watched
now
part
fascinated
and
part
embarrassed
and
finally
stackpole
said
i
suppose
we
ought
to
break
it
up
let
s
see
who
starts
to
win
bromley
suggested
if
ferguson
starts
then
we
break
it
up
if
tuttle
starts
let
him
do
it
all
right
said
stackpole
ll
take
mr
tuttle
lamb
said
i
think
he
s
gone
out
of
his
mind
stackpole
glanced
down
at
the
grunting
officers
and
saw
that
tuttle
who
was
younger
than
ferguson
and
had
kept
himself
in
better
condition
had
secured
possession
of
the
and
was
trying
to
bring
it
around
into
ferguson
s
face
stackpole
leaned
over
and
said
do
nt
shoot
him
mr
tuttle
better
hit
him
with
it
on
the
side
of
the
head
that
way
you
wo
nt
be
up
on
a
murder
rap
oh
lordy
bromley
said
suddenly
in
a
high
voice
knock
it
off
sirs
here
comes
the
captain
when
evers
reached
the
shore
after
leaving
pablo
tied
to
a
tree
he
sat
down
for
a
moment
to
catch
his
breath
and
to
try
to
figure
out
what
was
happening
there
had
been
sporadic
bursts
of
firing
but
he
could
nt
tell
who
was
doing
it
or
where
the
shots
came
from
men
from
the
icarus
or
both
god
alone
knew
what
was
going
on
or
who
the
green
clad
men
were
or
what
they
were
up
to
the
only
thing
that
was
certain
was
that
the
day
was
likely
to
end
in
a
free
for
all
if
something
was
nt
done
to
reverse
the
trend
when
he
d
sent
his
men
off
to
forage
he
had
apparently
pulled
the
stopper
on
a
bottle
containing
a
djinn
of
monumental
proportions
one
that
was
still
seeping
out
and
covering
the
island
like
marsh
gas
everything
was
going
wrong
and
the
possibilities
of
complete
disaster
were
multiplied
by
the
arrival
of
the
guerrillas
if
that
s
what
they
were
who
were
on
some
mission
of
their
own
he
tried
to
think
what
the
olive
green
fatigues
signified
and
all
he
could
remember
were
newspaper
accounts
of
uniformed
venezuelan
guerrillas
who
called
themselves
the
armed
forces
of
national
liberation
and
who
raided
villages
for
arms
and
ammunition
and
supplies
it
seemed
unlikely
that
venezuelans
would
be
on
this
island
and
besides
cuban
trained
troops
who
well
the
hell
with
it
they
probably
tied
in
with
grimond
who
himself
was
enough
of
an
enigma
the
only
thing
that
stood
out
clearly
was
that
nothing
good
was
likely
to
happen
with
that
fact
accepted
he
could
try
not
to
be
surprised
by
anything
and
try
not
to
panic
his
first
surprise
came
as
he
headed
toward
the
settlement
in
the
grass
to
the
side
of
the
path
ahead
he
saw
something
dark
and
long
it
looked
at
first
like
a
log
but
then
he
knew
it
was
nt
a
log
because
he
saw
the
sole
of
a
foot
grey
and
dirty
and
wrinkled
and
as
he
got
closer
he
saw
a
hand
then
he
saw
the
whole
body
and
it
was
the
old
man
whose
chickens
had
been
taken
his
eyes
were
flat
and
muddy
and
there
were
several
red
holes
in
him
and
a
line
of
ants
was
crawling
slowly
up
his
chin
and
into
his
mouth
the
gun
he
and
evers
picked
it
up
and
slung
it
on
his
shoulder
alongside
pablo
s
gun
he
stared
dumbly
at
the
body
thinking
he
should
bury
it
but
not
having
anything
to
dig
with
and
he
was
still
staring
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
when
he
heard
shots
coming
from
the
distance
ahead
these
were
not
machine
gun
shots
they
were
more
widely
spaced
and
first
there
were
two
followed
by
four
more
this
probably
meant
ferguson
and
his
but
by
this
time
evers
had
resigned
himself
to
the
fact
that
everybody
was
going
to
be
shooting
and
he
remembered
his
resolve
not
to
panic
all
right
he
thought
so
ferguson
s
finally
got
around
to
using
his
weapon
i
d
have
figured
him
to
have
been
among
the
first
but
it
does
nt
really
matter
when
he
does
it
it
s
what
he
s
shooting
at
that
counts
so
i
guess
the
next
thing
is
to
find
out
what
that
is
we
can
take
care
of
the
old
man
later
mood
of
resignation
interested
him
and
he
wondered
why
he
should
be
detached
when
things
were
going
to
hell
so
much
faster
than
he
d
feared
i
guess
it
s
just
that
i
ve
imposed
sanity
over
emotion
he
thought
i
m
in
the
enviable
position
of
being
able
to
look
at
things
rationally
and
not
get
upset
it
s
a
nice
trick
when
you
can
do
it
he
slung
one
gun
on
each
shoulder
and
feeling
something
like
a
guerrilla
himself
started
off
for
the
settlement
the
cluster
of
metal
and
tarpaper
shacks
drew
in
deeply
on
a
cigarette
i
kept
my
eyes
off
her
chest
there
are
howie
i
mean
the
doctor
came
in
a
little
while
and
i
was
glad
he
examined
all
of
izzie
s
cuts
and
swellings
put
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
told
him
to
come
to
the
office
the
next
day
for
x
rays
when
he
left
izzie
and
i
went
into
his
room
together
and
miriam
left
us
alone
the
whole
time
the
doctor
had
been
there
izzie
had
seemed
cocky
as
soon
as
he
got
into
his
room
though
he
collapsed
just
sort
of
folding
and
dropping
to
the
floor
i
lifted
him
to
his
chair
and
he
opened
his
eyes
halfway
he
was
shivering
and
i
threw
a
blanket
over
his
shoulders
should
i
call
the
doctor
again
i
asked
or
get
miriam
he
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
he
seemed
totally
sober
now
and
he
gave
me
a
long
look
as
if
he
were
trying
to
tell
me
he
could
nt
figure
out
why
it
had
turned
out
this
way
either
i
got
covers
and
then
i
left
you
try
to
sleep
i
said
maybe
i
ll
stop
by
in
a
few
days
mr
goldstein
was
on
critical
for
a
week
and
then
he
began
to
improve
he
did
nt
come
back
to
school
though
i
got
a
graduation
card
from
him
that
june
izzie
returned
to
classes
about
a
week
and
a
half
later
and
to
my
surprise
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
him
we
were
all
too
busy
worrying
about
the
playoffs
and
which
colleges
we
would
be
going
to
events
passed
pretty
quickly
in
those
days
izzie
got
a
state
scholarship
and
was
supposed
to
go
to
columbia
the
next
fall
but
when
i
was
home
for
thanksgiving
during
my
first
year
at
college
my
mother
told
me
that
he
d
dropped
out
of
school
and
was
living
at
home
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
at
the
end
of
my
first
year
of
college
i
d
driven
home
with
some
guys
who
were
on
the
freshman
team
with
me
to
show
them
around
i
d
improved
during
my
first
year
of
college
and
i
did
nt
have
much
trouble
with
the
erasmus
players
there
were
some
other
guys
at
the
schoolyard
who
played
college
ball
and
i
could
hold
my
own
with
them
too
i
d
developed
a
good
outside
shot
and
it
surprised
a
lot
of
the
guys
who
d
known
me
at
erasmus
my
friends
and
i
played
a
few
games
and
then
we
started
to
leave
hey
howie
you
see
your
friend
izzie
lately
one
of
the
erasmus
players
asked
no
there
he
is
did
nt
you
notice
he
s
a
real
star
now
the
guy
laughed
and
i
looked
where
he
d
pointed
on
the
other
side
of
the
wire
fence
at
the
far
end
of
the
playground
i
could
see
a
bunch
of
grade
school
kids
playing
basketball
i
had
to
squint
at
first
then
i
recognized
him
he
was
playing
with
a
group
of
little
kids
some
of
them
were
one
thing
you
got
ta
admit
he
s
got
the
best
set
shot
of
all
of
em
everybody
laughed
the
child
had
not
been
wanted
he
said
they
could
nt
afford
it
yet
she
said
they
had
nt
done
all
the
things
they
had
planned
to
do
they
thought
during
the
second
month
of
giving
up
the
child
but
decided
against
it
they
agreed
that
she
would
continue
to
teach
until
the
seventh
month
and
they
told
each
other
that
they
would
love
the
child
anyway
that
somehow
things
would
work
out
as
the
months
went
by
and
the
child
began
to
grow
inside
her
helen
changed
not
only
did
she
begin
to
forget
about
the
many
things
they
had
hoped
to
do
while
still
not
burdened
with
children
but
she
found
that
she
was
beginning
to
look
forward
to
becoming
a
mother
maybe
it
was
best
this
way
honey
gary
would
say
at
night
when
they
lay
in
bed
together
maybe
we
were
only
years
slip
by
inventing
excuses
if
this
had
nt
happened
to
us
after
spending
an
evening
with
their
friends
they
would
take
pleasure
almost
secretly
it
seemed
from
comparing
themselves
to
those
married
couples
who
were
still
without
children
from
noting
how
the
child
was
drawing
them
closer
to
one
another
she
wrote
to
her
family
and
to
his
and
they
received
long
letters
of
congratulations
and
sizable
checks
from
both
sets
of
parents
they
were
amazed
they
told
each
other
at
how
easily
they
could
accept
the
gifts
without
feelings
of
guilt
of
obligation
helen
delighted
in
her
third
grade
children
as
she
had
never
done
before
and
he
became
more
optimistic
about
their
financial
situation
several
times
a
week
he
would
sit
down
on
the
living
room
couch
with
her
and
he
would
go
over
the
figures
showing
her
with
pencil
and
paper
that
even
if
she
did
nt
return
to
teaching
for
three
years
everything
would
be
all
right
she
praised
him
for
his
ability
to
arrange
things
what
pleased
them
most
though
was
feeling
the
baby
listening
to
it
he
would
lie
with
his
ear
pressed
gently
to
her
stomach
and
every
time
he
heard
a
sound
they
would
experience
a
thrill
which
seemed
magical
i
think
i
m
falling
in
love
with
you
all
over
again
she
said
to
him
it
s
so
strange
she
had
never
seemed
more
beautiful
to
him
and
he
had
never
loved
her
more
they
had
never
he
felt
been
this
close
still
as
the
months
went
by
he
became
increasingly
uneasy
in
particular
he
was
afraid
of
what
would
happen
to
her
were
something
to
go
wrong
he
called
her
doctor
and
the
doctor
told
him
not
to
worry
he
did
anyway
helen
did
nt
he
saw
and
this
worried
him
even
more
while
she
was
making
supper
one
evening
he
leafed
through
mass
of
black
stone
darker
than
the
darkness
of
the
night
we
came
up
the
front
walk
into
the
house
rachel
s
parents
were
at
the
kitchen

over
tall
glasses
of
iced
coffee
joseph
gordon

at
michael
and
slowly
took
the
pipe
out
of
his
a
nosebleed

and
before

could
respond
i
put
my
hand
against
michael

back
and

him
to
his
room
i
snapped
on
the
ceiling

and

spread
i
helped
michael
onto

bed
he
lay
on
the
bed
his
head
drawn
back
his
chin
jutting
upward
i

the
forefinger
of
my
right
hand
over
his
upper
lip
and
pressed
down
ile

very
still
breathing
softly
his
eyes
closed
he
seemed
unaware
of
what
was
happening
the
door
to
the
room
opened
and
closed
joseph
gordon
came
up
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
was
a
tall
man
in
his
late
forties
with
broad
shoulders
thinning
brown
hair
sharp
blue
eyes
a
square
jaw
and
deeply
tanned
features
he
stared
at
michael
his
teeth
clamped
tight
around
his
pipe

splendid
time

he
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
leaned
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
michael
lay
very
still
his
eyes
closed
that
vulturous
bastard
joseph
gordon
said
under
his
breath
he
looked
at
me
i
m
going
to

doctor
my
finger
was
still
on
michael
s
upper
lip
i
felt
him

joseph
gordon
asked

he
said
l
le
gave
me
an
angry
look
and
seemed
about
to

something
then
he
glanced
at
michael

turned
abruptly
and
went
from
the
room
i
looked
down
at

his
voice

flat
without
emotion
i
could

killed
him
i
felt
cold

trusted
him
his
eyes
were
covered
by
his
arm
his
voice
was
rising
below
the
small
straight
nose
his
lips
opened
and
closed
stiffly
mouthing
the
words
you
ca
nt
trust
any
of
them
they
re
all
the
same
they
re
