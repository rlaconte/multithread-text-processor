only
to
protect
himself
there
were
dangerous
kinds
of
women
who
could
wreck
the
happiness
of
a
man
old
or
young
and
care
not
a
flip
of
the
fan
about
it
one
should
know
how
to
tell
the
good
ones
from
the
bad
and
generally
alas
it
was
not
possible
until
it
was
too
late
there
was
another
purpose
too
beauty
was
defending
herself
and
marcel
and
harry
or
rather
what
she
had
done
to
harry
perhaps
her
conscience
troubled
her
for
she
talked
often
about
the
plate
glass
man
and
what
might
be
happening
to
him
in
pittsburgh
love
was
bewildering
and
many
times
you
would
nt
be
happy
if
you
did
and
would
nt
be
if
you
did
nt
you
might
make
a
resolve
to
go
off
by
yourself
and
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
love
but
men
had
refused
to
let
beauty
do
it
and
some
day
soon
women
would
be
refusing
to
let
lanny
do
it
soldier
diplomat
and
man
of
the
world
who
had
written
under
the
pen
name
of
stendhal
and
who
would
tell
them
how
love
had
fared
in
the
midst
of
the
last
world
war
just
a
hundred
years
earlier
not
so
long
go
in
europe
s
long
story
there
came
post
cards
from
marcel
detaze
he
was
well
busy
and
happy
to
know
they
were
safe
at
home
he
was
not
permitted
to
say
where
he
was
but
gave
the
number
of
his
regiment
and
battalion
the
censoring
of
mail
was
strict
but
no
censor
in
france
would
object
to
a
painter
s
declaring
that
he
loved
his
beautiful
blond
mistress
or
to
her
replying
that
the
sentiments
were
reciprocated
beauty
fed
her
soul
upon
these
messages
plus
robbie
s
assurance
that
the
war
could
nt
last
more
than
three
or
four
month
maybe
marcel
was
nt
going
to
see
any
fighting
he
would
come
home
with
a
story
of
interesting
adventure
and
life
would
begin
again
where
it
had
and
everybody
they
met
now
was
confident
that
the
french
armies
were
going
to
hold
the
germans
while
the
russian
steam
roller
hurtled
over
prussia
and
captured
berlin
the
french
military
authorities
had
been
so
confident
that
they
had
planned
a
giant
movement
of
their
forces
through
alsace
and
lorraine
they
would
break
the
german
lines
at
the
south
then
sweeping
north
cut
the
communications
of
the
enemy
advancing
through
belgium
and
northern
france
the
papers
told
about
the
beginning
of
this
counterattack
and
what
it
was
intended
to
do
then
suddenly
they
fell
silent
and
the
next
reports
of
fighting
in
this
district
came
from
places
in
france
those
who
understood
military
affairs
knew
what
this
meant
that
the
armies
of
la
patrie
had
sustained
a
grave
defeat
as
to
what
was
happening
farther
north
not
all
the
censorship
in
the
land
could
hide
the
facts
from
the
public
one
had
only
to
take
a
map
and
mark
on
it
the
places
where
fighting
was
reported
and
he
would
see
that
it
was
the
german
steam
roller
or
twenty
miles
a
day
the
little
belgian
army
was
fighting
desperately
but
was
being
swept
aside
its
forts
were
being
pulverized
by
heavy
artillery
and
towns
and
villages
in
the
path
of
the
invasion
were
being
wrecked
and
burned
the
still
smaller
british
army
which
had
been
landed
at
the
channel
ports
was
apparently
meeting
the
same
fate
the
kaiser
was
on
his
way
to
paris
there
came
a
letter
from
sophie
baroness
de
la
tourette
that
very
lively
lady
had
been
having
an
adventure
and
wrote
about
it
in
detail
being
shut
up
in
a
room
in
a
fourth
class
hotel
in
paris
much
bored
with
nothing
to
do
she
had
gone
to
spend
the
month
of
august
with
friends
at
a
country
place
on
the
river
maas
which
flows
through
the
heart
of
belgium
sophie
was
a
nonpolitical
person
entirely
devoted
to
having
a
good
time
she
rarely
looked
at
newspapers
and
when
she
heard
people
talking
about
war
threats
she
paid
no
attention
being
unable
to
take
seriously
the
of
her
social
position
the
ladies
she
was
visiting
shared
her
attitude
news
traveled
slowly
in
the
country
and
when
at
last
they
heard
that
the
germans
had
crossed
the
frontier
they
did
not
worry
the
army
would
be
going
to
france
and
it
might
be
interesting
to
watch
it
pass
only
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
guns
did
they
realize
that
they
might
be
in
danger
and
then
it
was
too
late
a
troop
of
uhlans
with
long
lances
came
galloping
up
the
driveway
and
the
automobiles
and
horses
on
the
place
were
seized
soon
afterward
arrived
several
limousines
and
elegant
officers
descended
and
with
bowing
and
heel
clicking
informed
the
ladies
of
the
regrettable
need
to
take
the
chateau
for
a
temporary
staff
headquarters
they
all
had
wasp
waists
and
wore
monocles
long
gray
coats
gold
bracelets
and
shiny
belts
and
boots
their
manners
were
impeccable
and
they
spoke
excellent
english
and
seemed
to
be
well
pleased
with
a
lady
who
was
introduced
as
miss
sophie
had
suddenly
realized
that
under
the
law
being
married
to
a
frenchman
she
was
french
and
might
be
interned
for
the
period
of
the
war
that
night
she
sent
her
maid
to
the
village
and
succeeded
in
hiring
a
cart
and
an
elderly
bony
white
horse
taking
only
a
suitcase
she
and
the
maid
and
a
peasant
driver
had
set
out
toward
brussels
there
was
fighting
everywhere
to
the
south
and
east
of
them
and
the
roads
were
crowded
with
refugees
driving
dogcarts
trundling
handcarts
or
carrying
their
belongings
on
their
backs
more
than
once
they
had
had
to
sit
for
long
periods
by
the
roadside
to
let
the
german
armies
pass
and
the
woman
s
letter
was
full
of
amazed
horror
at
the
perfection
of
the
kaiser
s
war
machine
for
you
ve
made
your
men
comfortable
for
the
night
i
ll
have
mr
wiswell
with
me
and
we
ll
be
even
more
eager
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
than
he
ll
be
to
talk
to
us
as
we
moved
out
to
the
open
space
the
judge
repeated
name
after
name
to
delancey
who
snapped
them
out
in
a
voice
that
must
i
thought
be
audible
on
staten
island
that
clone
the
judge
took
us
to
his
own
hut
which
like
the
hospital
and
all
the
other
shelters
was
nothing
but
a
roof
of
branches
supported
by
four
tree
trunks
to
my
surprise
the
hut
already
had
an
occupant
and
it
had
a
ready
made
audience
too
for
on
every
side
of
it
sat
and
stood
scores
of
loyalists
their
eyeballs
white
in
the
lantern
light
and
their
hands
perpetually
brushing
at
mosquitoes
made
a
pale
flickering
as
of
a
half
moonlight
chair
beside
the
occupant
of
the
hut
who
was
lying
on
a
thick
mat
of
sedge
in
the
light
of
the
lanterns
his
thin
face
had
a
waxy
pallor
but
his
black
eyes
sparkled
and
his
lips
were
curved
in
a
smile
that
was
both
patient
and
sardonic
the
judge
leaned
clown
and
looked
at
him
seemed
reassured
by
what
he
saw
then
said
to
me
this
is
the
reverend
edmund
lane
mr
wiswell
one
of
these
days
he
ll
be
a
bishop
but
we
almost
lost
him
this
afternoon
because
he
thought
the
rebels
would
nt
shoot
their
own
countrymen
we
took
four
buckshot
out
of
his
shoulder
lane
moved
his
hand
in
a
small
gesture
that
took
in
all
the
men
outside
the
hut
they
ve
come
here
for
news
judge
you
d
better
arrange
to
give
it
to
them
or
they
ll
stand
around
all
night
wait
ing
the
judge
turned
to
me
mr
wiswell
have
you
any
information
for
us
in
regard
to
him
to
move
to
our
relief
no
i
said
and
i
spoke
loudly
so
that
i
might
be
heard
at
a
considerable
distance
i
m
sorry
i
m
not
a
carrier
of
information
but
a
seeker
for
it
i
do
nt
know
the
general
s
plans
or
how
long
he
may
be
delayed
before
attacking
my
instructions
are
only
to
find
out
your
numbers
and
the
conditions
under
which
you
live
and
report
on
em
to
the
general
i
heard
voices
muttering
in
disappointment
and
then
after
a
moment
or
two
the
word
declaration
it
was
repeated
from
here
and
there
declaration
declaration
until
it
became
a
general
insistent
outcry
declaration
declaration
the
judge
looked
at
me
apologetically
we
ve
all
heard
congress
issued
a
declaration
of
independence
a
short
time
ago
but
nobody
can
tell
us
what
was
in
it
can
you
by
any
chance
tell
us
what
it
s
bout
i
can
give
you
a
general
idea
i
ca
nt
recite
it
for
ou
but
two
sentences
stick
in
my
mind
and
i
can
say
em
for
you
word
for
word
every
loyalist
almost
knows
its
first
sentence
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
for
one
people
to
dissolve
the
political
bands
which
have
connected
them
with
another
and
to
assume
among
the
powers
of
the
earth
the
separate
and
equal
station
to
which
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nature
s
god
entitle
them
a
decent
respect
to
the
opinions
of
mankind
requires
that
they
should
declare
the
causes
which
impel
them
to
the
separation
somewhere
among
the
close
packed
circle
of
listeners
a
man
laughed
abruptly
and
the
laughter
spread
as
a
ripple
progresses
upon
the
surface
of
a
pool
judge
hendon
raised
his
hand
and
the
laughter
died
away
do
you
know
who
wrote
the
paper
he
asked
thomas
jefferson
i
m
told
sir
the
judge
nodded
i
did
you
not
when
it
becomes
necessary
for
one
people
he
made
an
exasperated
movement
four
fifths
of
the
people
on
this
island
are
loyal
two
thirds
of
the
people
in
new
york
and
pennsylvania
are
loyal
more
than
half
the
people
in
all
of
north
america
are
loyal
it
looks
to
me
as
though
mr
jefferson
has
nt
a
high
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
not
if
he
wants
mankind
to
think
that
i
and
all
the
others
who
have
fled
to
the
security
of
this
swamp
and
another
million
of
our
fellow
countrymen
are
not
people
you
ll
be
equally
interested
in
the
other
sentence
i
said
it
reads
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
self
evident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
well
well
judge
hendon
said
so
all
men
are
created
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
he
shook
his
head
i
suppose
we
in
this
swamp
are
supposed
to
be
in
possession
of
our
liberty
and
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
since
mr
jefferson
declares
them
to
be
our
unalienable
rights
an
angry
muttering
rose
from
the
crowd
of
listeners
the
reverend
mr
lane
raised
a
protesting
hand
no
profanity
please
model
yourselves
on
judge
hendon
do
nt
make
matters
worse
by
speaking
indiscreetly
or
with
improper
heat
oh
my
no
buell
said
when
the
neighbors
tar
and
feather
you
do
nt
ever
call
em
anything
worse
than
the
said
neighbors
if
you
get
too
hot
about
it
you
can
relieve
yourself
with
whereas
and
feloniously
like
this
whereas
the
said
neighbors
did
feloniously
tar
and
feather
my
aforesaid
hide
including
my
aforesaid
hair
my
said
nose
and
aforesaid
fingernails
therefore
know
all
men
and
so
on
yes
i
went
on
hastily
those
two
sentences
are
the
only
ones
i
can
quote
exactly
but
the
document
speaks
of
the
abuses
suffered
by
residents
of
north
america
at
england
s
hands
it
says
that
the
king
of
england
has
refused
his
assent
to
wholesome
laws
and
plans
the
establishment
of
absolute
tyranny
over
dreams
that
shake
us
nightly
these
terrible
dreams
that
shake
us
nightly
that
shake
us
nightly
but
not
if
he
thought
of
delano
by
daylight
there
was
a
dark
star
for
him
to
steer
by
in
broad
daylight
a
fixed
and
steadying
star
and
all
he
needed
was
to
keep
his
eyes
on
it
he
said
to
himself
as
he
returned
for
his
last
afternoon
at
the
camp
and
it
was
thus
that
the
afternoon
passed
for
delano
was
with
him
wherever
he
walked
or
stood
not
upright
any
more
not
waiting
there
on
his
feet
with
his
white
hands
hanging
at
his
side
but
laid
straightly
in
his
grave
horizontal
forever
his
head
no
longer
bent
upon
his
shoulders
the
flashlight
gone
out
for
of
this
morning
s
calmness
at
the
same
time
that
he
kept
on
repeating
to
himself
i
know
now
what
i
have
done
it
is
something
the
consequences
of
which
i
must
never
expect
to
escape
i
have
killed
a
man
because
of
me
this
man
is
no
longer
erect
in
the
sunshine
standing
there
for
other
people
to
look
at
i
have
laid
him
down
i
have
laid
him
down
out
of
everybody
s
sight
except
mine
and
lucy
s
and
since
he
can
not
stand
again
it
is
our
task
to
keep
him
from
trying
to
keep
his
peace
for
him
i
am
not
thinking
of
our
peace
of
his
he
did
not
seek
this
peace
and
i
gave
it
to
him
for
no
reason
but
i
did
give
it
to
him
and
if
i
made
the
terrible
mistake
of
hiding
what
i
had
done
even
the
next
day
it
was
too
late
it
would
be
a
greater
mistake
now
to
shatter
the
silence
in
which
he
sleeps
and
in
which
our
minds
a
sleeping
man
a
man
for
whose
peace
we
are
responsible
once
it
crossed
ray
s
mind
that
suspicion
might
settle
upon
him
after
he
had
disappeared
and
the
thin
smile
of
donaldson
hung
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
like
a
threat
but
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
never
strictly
been
under
suspicion
and
the
fear
was
answered
at
last
by
certain
words
of
lena
s
which
spoke
themselves
in
his
ear
we
know
about
lucy
yes
they
all
knew
about
lucy
that
would
be
enough
for
them
to
talk
about
and
think
about
day
in
and
day
out
for
weeks
and
months
and
yet
they
knew
nothing
about
lucy
he
knew
so
much
and
now
so
entirely
so
tenderly
loved
her
as
he
thought
forward
across
the
diminishing
stretch
of
time
until
it
should
be
nine
o
clock
it
was
she
who
had
quieted
the
world
for
him
and
brought
it
into
order
or
into
all
the
order
he
deserved
the
most
he
could
possibly
deserve
was
this
unrest
which
would
last
oh
it
might
last
forever
leaving
him
to
be
sure
but
half
alive
a
man
merely
not
rest
less
a
mind
merely
not
tortured
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
expected
more
from
the
world
but
he
was
lucky
to
have
this
much
to
be
going
away
from
windless
like
this
so
utterly
unnoticed
it
was
almost
as
if
windless
did
not
care
what
he
had
done
it
was
tolerating
his
departure
it
was
turning
its
head
while
he
and
lucy
slipped
out
in
the
darkness
and
perhaps
it
was
exacting
its
penalty
after
all
by
ignoring
them
thus
it
was
letting
them
die
away
from
it
into
the
silence
of
which
their
thoughts
henceforward
would
be
composed
ray
until
now
had
been
unable
to
imagine
himself
in
any
other
place
with
lucy
nor
did
he
see
the
place
now
he
only
saw
them
in
a
deep
silence
watching
each
other
s
thoughts
passing
nights
and
days
perhaps
without
a
single
word
as
they
waited
in
the
would
be
no
more
of
these
terrible
dreams
he
shook
himself
it
was
time
to
go
and
dress
in
the
half
darkness
of
number
and
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
under
the
bed
besides
his
clothes
to
take
off
these
he
had
on
and
fold
them
neatly
for
dutch
to
find
whenever
dutch
should
pick
up
the
courage
to
enter
a
cabin
which
was
not
for
innocent
men
to
enter
he
entered
it
and
went
straight
to
the
bed
on
which
a
beam
from
the
arc
light
fell
through
the
drawn
curtains
casting
black
shadows
underneath
into
which
ray
hesitated
only
an
instant
to
plunge
his
hand
nothing
was
there
to
feel
or
see
besides
his
clothes
but
he
gasped
as
he
realized
it
and
undressed
and
dressed
with
a
haste
which
told
him
that
his
nerves
were
no
longer
as
steady
as
they
had
been
for
the
only
way
for
him
to
go
where
he
was
going
now
was
by
the
path
to
the
spring
and
thence
by
the
gravel
road
and
all
at
once
he
was
not
as
he
would
have
to
come
in
turn
to
the
spring
to
the
overflow
to
the
crotched
maple
and
to
the
place
in
the
gravel
where
on
a
certain
night
no
darker
than
this
one
he
came
forth
from
the
cabin
resolutely
he
must
go
at
once
for
the
time
had
arrived
he
must
stop
this
devil
of
his
thought
stop
it
by
the
very
regularity
of
his
pace
now
that
he
had
started
down
the
path
the
scheme
appeared
to
be
working
for
ray
deviating
at
no
moment
from
the
pace
he
set
his
feet
and
saying
lucy
s
name
to
himself
as
if
it
were
a
charm
against
the
darkness
advanced
past
each
of
the
points
he
had
enumerated
without
so
much
as
a
flick
of
his
head
or
a
leap
of
his
nerve
the
only
thing
he
noticed
was
that
in
his
imagination
he
walked
faster
and
faster
past
each
critical
turn
not
actually
faster
for
he
could
test
himself
there
but
by
some
illusion
so
it
was
as
if
two
one
ran
exploring
all
its
possibilities
before
he
went
on
to
the
next
judy
talking
the
whole
time
pulled
all
her
treasures
out
in
a
heap
took
a
quick
glance
at
them
and
went
straight
for
the
one
she
liked
best
a
minikin
black
baby
in
a
wicker
cradle
toby
pulled
all
his
out
too
but
he
arranged
them
in
a
neat
pattern
on
the
eiderdown
and
looked
at
them
for
a
long
time
in
complete
silence
then
he
picked
up
squirls
inside
and
put
it
by
itself
a
little
way
off
after
that
he
played
with
the
other
toys
appreciatively
enough
but
from
time
to
time
his
eyes
would
stray
towards
mrs
miniver
the
glass
marble
as
though
to
make
sure
it
was
still
waiting
for
him
mrs
miniver
watched
him
with
a
mixture
of
delight
and
misgiving
it
was
her
own
favourite
approach
to
life
but
the
trouble
was
that
sometimes
the
marble
rolled
away
judy
s
was
safer
vin
s
on
the
whole
the
wisest
of
the
three
to
the
banquet
of
real
presents
which
was
waiting
downstairs
covered
with
a
red
and
white
dust
sheet
the
stocking
toys
of
course
were
only
an
aperitif
but
they
had
a
special
and
exciting
quality
of
their
own
perhaps
it
was
the
atmosphere
in
which
they
were
opened
the
chill
the
black
window
panes
the
unfamiliar
hour
perhaps
it
was
the
powerful
charm
of
the
miniature
of
toy
toys
of
smallness
squared
perhaps
it
was
the
sense
of
limitation
within
a
strict
emptier
of
a
christmas
stocking
something
of
the
same
enjoyment
which
is
experienced
by
the
writer
and
the
reader
of
a
sonnet
or
perhaps
it
was
merely
that
the
spell
of
the
old
legend
still
persisted
even
though
for
everybody
in
the
room
except
toby
the
legend
itself
was
outworn
three
stockings
there
were
cross
currents
of
pleasure
too
smiling
glances
exchanged
by
her
and
vin
about
the
two
younger
children
she
remembered
suddenly
having
been
an
eldest
child
the
unsurpassable
sense
of
grandeur
that
such
glances
gave
one
and
by
her
and
clem
because
they
were
both
grown
ups
and
by
her
and
judy
because
they
were
both
women
and
by
her
and
toby
because
they
were
both
the
kind
that
leaves
the
glass
marble
till
the
end
the
room
was
laced
with
an
invisible
network
of
affectionate
understanding
this
was
one
of
the
moments
thought
mrs
miniver
which
paid
off
at
a
single
stroke
all
the
accumulations
on
the
debit
side
of
parenthood
the
morning
sickness
and
the
quite
astonishing
pain
the
pram
cook
s
eye
the
holiday
nurse
who
had
been
in
the
best
families
the
pungent
white
mice
the
shrivelled
caterpillars
the
plasticine
on
the
door
handles
the
face
flannels
in
the
bathroom
the
nameless
horrors
down
the
crevices
of
armchairs
the
alarms
and
emergencies
the
swallowed
button
the
inexplicable
ear
ache
the
ominous
rash
appearing
on
the
eve
of
a
journey
the
school
bills
and
the
dentists
bills
the
shortened
step
the
tempered
pace
the
emotional
compromises
the
divided
loyalties
the
adventures
continually
forsworn
and
now
vin
was
eating
his
tangerine
pig
by
pig
judy
had
undressed
the
baby
doll
and
was
putting
on
its
frock
again
back
to
front
toby
was
turning
the
glass
marble
round
and
round
against
the
light
trying
to
count
the
squirls
there
were
sounds
of
movement
in
the
house
they
were
within
measurable
distance
of
the
blessed
chink
of
early
morning
tea
mrs
miniver
looked
towards
the
window
the
dark
sky
had
already
paled
a
little
in
its
frame
of
cherry
pink
one
had
to
frame
it
in
something
to
see
it
at
all
twelfth
night
was
over
the
decorations
were
down
christmas
which
like
all
extremes
dates
easily
seemed
as
demode
as
a
hat
in
a
passport
photograph
and
still
mrs
miniver
had
not
bought
herself
a
new
engagement
book
but
was
scribbling
untidy
notes
on
the
fly
leaf
of
the
old
one
as
usual
she
had
meant
to
buy
one
before
leaving
london
for
starlings
but
as
usual
there
had
nt
been
time
it
is
a
thing
she
knew
which
must
never
be
done
in
a
hurry
an
engagement
book
is
the
most
important
of
all
those
small
adjuncts
to
life
that
tribe
of
humble
familiars
which
jog
along
beside
one
from
year
s
end
to
year
s
end
apparently
trivial
but
momentous
by
reason
of
their
terrible
intimacy
a
sponge
a
comb
a
tooth
brush
a
spectacle
case
a
fountain
pen
these
are
the
things
which
need
to
be
chosen
much
a
part
of
one
that
they
can
scarcely
be
classed
as
inanimate
insensitive
certainly
but
so
are
one
s
nails
and
hair
and
although
some
of
them
can
be
given
away
if
one
takes
a
dislike
to
them
with
others
the
only
remedy
is
destruction
and
there
is
no
case
on
record
of
anybody
however
rich
being
strong
minded
enough
to
throw
an
almost
new
sponge
into
the
fire
meekly
one
puts
up
with
its
inconvenient
shape
its
repulsive
texture
and
the
cretinous
face
which
is
discernible
among
its
contours
when
it
is
lightly
squeezed
eventually
thank
goodness
it
will
wear
out
or
with
any
luck
one
may
leave
it
behind
in
an
hotel
but
an
engagement
book
once
used
is
a
far
worse
problem
to
give
it
away
is
impossible
to
lose
it
is
disastrous
and
to
scrap
it
and
start
a
new
one
entails
a
laborious
copying
out
of
all
the
entries
that
have
already
been
made
unless
of
course
one
is
prepared
to
risk
giving
one
s
biographers
if
any
the
impression
that
one
has
the
new
engagement
book
suffered
from
a
prolonged
attack
of
leprosy
or
worse
so
it
was
nt
until
well
into
january
that
mrs
miniver
up
for
the
day
from
starlings
to
go
to
the
dentist
found
herself
in
a
stationer
s
shop
with
enough
leisure
to
give
the
matter
the
attention
it
deserved
she
stopped
in
front
of
the
rack
marked
diaries
and
prepared
to
enjoy
chapel
sir
how
could
we
have
known
then
that
what
happened
that
night
so
small
so
foolish
would
be
the
cause
of
misery
to
us
all
elias
never
forgot
that
night
but
his
revenge
was
the
sweeter
when
he
had
chance
to
have
it
sweet
it
was
and
greatly
he
relished
it
and
every
morsel
of
it
he
took
but
even
of
him
i
can
think
of
with
sorrow
now
at
this
moment
those
times
those
people
daughters
and
their
shop
have
gone
how
can
there
be
fury
felt
for
things
that
are
gone
to
dust
chapter
ninei
i
ere
in
this
quiet
house
i
sit
thinking
back
the
structure
of
my
life
building
again
that
which
has
fallen
it
do
seem
to
me
that
the
life
of
man
is
merely
a
pattern
scrawled
on
time
with
little
thought
little
care
and
no
sense
of
design
why
is
it
i
wonder
that
people
suffer
when
there
is
so
little
need
when
an
effort
of
will
and
some
hard
work
would
bring
them
from
their
misery
into
peace
and
contentment
the
slag
heap
is
moving
again
i
can
hear
it
whispering
to
itself
and
as
it
whispers
the
walls
of
this
brave
little
house
are
girding
themselves
to
withstand
the
assault
for
months
more
than
i
ever
thought
it
would
have
the
courage
to
withstand
that
great
mound
has
borne
down
upon
these
walls
this
roof
and
for
those
months
the
great
bully
has
been
beaten
they
were
craftsmen
stout
beams
honest
blocks
good
work
and
love
for
the
job
all
that
is
in
this
house
but
the
slag
heap
moves
pressing
on
down
and
down
over
and
all
round
this
house
which
was
my
father
s
and
my
mother
s
and
now
is
mine
soon
perhaps
in
an
hour
the
house
will
be
buried
and
the
slag
heap
will
stretch
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
right
down
to
the
river
in
the
valley
poor
river
how
beautiful
you
were
how
gay
your
song
how
clear
your
green
waters
how
you
enjoyed
your
play
among
the
sleepy
rocks
i
shall
always
remember
the
day
i
saw
you
after
i
had
been
in
bed
so
long
that
morning
mr
gruffydd
came
to
the
house
early
and
opened
the
door
of
the
kitchen
so
that
the
sun
shone
in
all
round
him
big
he
looked
and
full
of
happy
purpose
good
morning
mrs
morgan
he
said
good
morning
surprise
there
is
good
to
see
you
tot
how
green
was
my
valley
i
have
come
for
huw
he
said
as
though
he
was
asking
to
take
a
loaf
for
old
mrs
llywarch
huw
my
mother
asked
and
looked
over
the
table
at
me
with
her
eyebrows
almost
touching
this
little
blue
cloth
yes
said
mr
gruffydd
this
is
the
morning
he
has
been
waiting
for
i
ji
looked
at
mr
gruffydd
and
knew
but
my
mother
was
still
in
fog
with
her
the
daffodils
are
out
mama
i
said
oh
huw
my
mother
said
and
put
down
the
bread
knife
and
turned
her
head
away
where
are
your
clothes
huw
he
asked
me
but
quiet
and
look
ing
at
my
mother
s
back
under
my
pillow
sir
i
said
your
pillow
he
said
for
these
months
come
you
then
he
said
and
smiling
he
was
you
shall
bring
back
a
posy
fit
for
a
queen
for
your
brave
mother
is
it
indeed
i
will
i
said
and
back
i
pulled
the
pillow
and
out
came
my
clothes
that
i
had
made
ready
ever
since
i
had
put
my
mind
to
the
matter
pain
there
was
and
a
helpless
feeling
in
all
my
bones
but
i
was
determined
to
have
those
clothes
on
on
they
went
and
no
nonsense
though
the
stockings
were
big
and
the
trews
too
short
but
i
had
grown
and
got
thin
so
it
was
no
use
to
grumble
there
is
a
sight
i
must
have
looked
when
i
put
my
legs
out
and
stood
up
but
neither
mr
gruffydd
nor
my
mother
looked
at
me
so
i
was
spared
to
blush
and
very
thankful
up
on
my
back
huw
mr
gruffydd
said
and
bent
his
knees
so
that
i
could
put
my
shocked
i
was
to
find
myself
up
on
the
shoulders
of
a
minister
it
seemed
wrong
to
be
so
familiar
but
there
i
was
and
carried
to
the
door
ile
will
be
back
in
two
hours
mrs
morgan
my
little
one
said
mr
gruffydd
god
bless
you
my
mother
said
and
still
not
looking
how
green
was
my
valley
good
bye
our
lam
i
said
with
my
legs
falling
about
at
the
back
get
ready
the
big
pot
for
the
daffodils
i
will
have
an
armful
for
you
and
some
for
bron
outside
then
and
through
the
blessed
curtains
of
air
spun
with
morning
mist
and
sunshine
blown
upon
us
by
wind
from
the
southeastand
the
draughts
that
played
in
the
valley
are
you
right
huw
mr
gruffydd
asked
me
am
i
too
quick
no
indeed
mr
gruffydd
i
said
go
you
is
the
road
and
up
by
there
are
the
daffodils
tight
now
for
the
first
few
minutes
i
was
shutting
my
eyes
to
get
used
to
the
sunshine
so
raw
and
pure
and
shining
white
then
i
got
used
to
it
and
less
tears
came
and
i
was
able
to
see
without
screwing
up
my
eyes
and
having
to
blink
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
slag
heap
big
it
had
grown
and
long
and
black
without
life
or
sign
lying
along
the
bottom
of
the
valley
on
both
sides
of
the
river
the
green
grass
and
the
reeds
and
the
flowers
all
had
gone
crushed
beneath
it
and
every
minute
the
burden
grew
as
cage
after
cage
screeched
along
the
cables
from
the
pit
bumped
to
a
stop
at
the
tipping
pier
and
emptied
dusty
loads
on
to
the
ridged
black
dirty
back
on
our
side
of
the
valley
the
heap
reached
to
then
i
thought
were
not
taken
up
he
was
unnaturally
quiet
earlier
in
the
evening
i
had
shown
him
where
i
had
slept
the
night
before
and
now
he
opened
the
door
into
the
room
mrs
hale
had
had
he
said
i
m
going
out
chace
i
want
to
try
out
another
idea
will
you
go
in
there
where
mrs
hale
slept
and
stay
for
ten
minutes
this
room
we
ll
leave
dark
when
the
ten
minutes
are
up
turn
out
the
light
in
there
and
come
back
in
here
you
can
feel
your
way
to
the
bed
and
lie
down
right
where
you
slept
last
night
beside
this
window
you
said
belding
s
car
stood
where
ours
does
now
did
nt
you
all
right
then
will
you
please
stay
here
on
the
bed
without
any
lights
until
i
come
back
strain
your
ears
for
any
sound
try
to
putwe
make
a
test
run
yourself
into
the
mood
of
last
night
if
you
can
that
would
help
i
did
try
sat
on
eunice
hale
s
bed
and
went
back
over
all
the
details
of
our
trip
down
from
canada
it
was
very
quiet
once
i
thought
i
heard
a
radio
somewhere
one
car
went
over
the
back
road
and
two
dogs
barked
during
the
ten
minutes
it
seemed
more
like
half
an
hour
then
i
put
out
the
light
and
groped
my
way
in
complete
darkness
to
the
other
bed
and
lay
down
there
was
no
sound
now
last
night
there
had
been
an
occasional
moan
from
mrs
hale
i
continued
to
ponder
the
smallest
happenings
of
the
previous
night
wondering
which
of
them
bruce
considered
significant
what
had
brought
him
here
tonight
did
he
think
the
same
thing
would
happen
again
when
that
idea
came
to
me
my
pulse
grew
a
little
stronger
and
it
was
just
then
that
i
heard
the
queer
swishing
sound
i
d
heard
before
as
though
something
were
being
dragged
outside
my
window
my
neck
felt
suddenly
very
bare
at
the
back
and
my
effort
to
prick
them
up
there
was
a
very
faint
click
as
though
someone
had
tapped
two
pieces
of
metal
like
two
silver
knives
together
it
was
no
sharper
than
that
i
had
nt
heard
quite
that
sound
before
it
had
been
slightly
different
there
were
some
muffled
indistinguishable
noises
and
then
the
movements
that
i
had
taken
for
those
of
a
big
dog
now
there
should
be
the
whimper
of
a
little
dog
but
that
could
nt
happen
again
because
tippy
was
sick
or
dead
i
wondered
which
after
a
short
silence
i
was
startled
by
an
entirely
unexpected
noise
a
man
s
voice
pitched
so
death
thumbs
a
ridelow
i
could
nt
make
out
any
words
but
it
sounded
as
if
something
had
gone
wrong
was
it
perkins
had
someonefound
him
there
was
he
in
danger
i
wanted
to
rush
out
but
he
had
asked
me
to
stay
there
and
stay
there
i
did
getting
more
uneasy
each
second
i
did
nt
look
out
the
direction
of
the
voices
one
voice
perkins
this
time
for
sure
suddenly
came
clearly
through
the
window
chace
it
said
chace
and
then
as
i
started
to
get
to
my
feet
stay
there
i
do
nt
need
you
i
ll
be
right
in
did
he
want
someone
else
to
know
i
was
awake
and
listening
a
few
seconds
later
our
door
opened
and
perkinsswitched
on
the
light
inside
he
came
over
to
the
bed
his
eyes
glowing
well
he
said
and
waited
i
told
him
all
that
i
d
heard
and
just
how
it
had
differed
from
what
i
d
heard
the
night
before
who
else
was
there
whom
were
you
talking
to
i
finished
i
ll
tell
you
tomorrow
he
promised
and
took
one
quick
turn
across
the
room
and
back
now
we
must
get
some
sleep
we
re
going
to
be
busy
tomorrow
we
did
and
woke
me
up
when
my
eyes
were
clear
enough
to
see
him
i
thought
he
could
nt
have
been
asleep
at
all
but
he
said
he
had
i
ve
got
another
idea
about
that
test
run
to
senator
frary
s
it
came
to
me
after
you
were
asleep
but
i
wanted
to
try
it
by
daylight
it
was
having
that
on
my
mind
that
woke
me
up
i
ll
get
the
car
started
hurry
chris
i
was
glad
as
i
dragged
on
my
clothes
that
it
had
not
been
possible
to
try
this
new
idea
in
the
dark
we
make
a
test
run
we
slipped
through
patterson
easily
enough
this
morning
with
no
traffic
and
no
lights
yet
to
stop
us
when
we
got
to
the
side
road
at
the
first
corner
of
the
frary
estate
perkins
turned
into
it
let
s
see
what
s
up
here
he
suggested
it
was
a
narrow
road
with
a
graveled
surface
hard
enough
for
the
little
traffic
woodland
were
on
our
left
the
house
gardens
orchards
and
more
woodland
on
our
right
we
could
see
the
stables
and
dairy
on
the
farm
side
with
a
crossroad
cutting
through
to
the
opposite
side
in
a
short
straight
line
our
road
bore
somewhat
to
the
left
we
drove
slowly
taking
all
this
in
there
was
enough
upwardgrade
to
make
it
just
possible
to
run
in
high
gear
at
our
slow
speed
at
the
top
which
was
the
upper
corner
of
frary
s
place
the
road
ended
at
a
slightly
better
and
wider
highway
running
at
right
angles
to
ours
ah
this
is
what
i
wanted
perkins
said
and
without
hesitation
turned
to
the
right
a
mile
more
or
less
brought
to
sight
the
great
white
pile
of
the
frary
house
its
back
to
us
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
so
close
but
bruce
was
nt
i
suspected
there
must
be
a
road
rather
close
to
it
back
here
he
told
corner
where
we
turned
and
see
where
this
road
goes
in
the
other
direction
we
had
to
run
half
did
nt
always
tell
the
truth
about
things
i
see
well
look
professor
do
you
remember
a
couple
of
chester
s
classmates
jimmy
hayes
jimmy
hayes
exclaimed
the
professor
now
there
was
a
boy
one
of
the
most
brilliant
i
ever
had
he
undoubtedly
went
far
you
do
nt
know
what
became
of
him
unfortunately
no
but
i
m
convinced
that
wherever
he
is
he
s
very
successful
aside
from
classes
consistently
jimmie
hayes
was
a
natural
born
leader
i
believe
he
was
considered
a
very
able
athlete
also
football
you
know
he
ought
to
be
easy
to
find
then
johnny
commented
now
about
one
more
boy
archibald
fitzgerald
the
professor
did
nt
remember
him
so
well
but
after
screwing
up
his
eyes
a
while
he
nodded
yes
archibald
no
i
m
sorry
but
i
ca
nt
say
as
much
for
him
in
fact
i
remember
he
was
an
even
poorer
student
than
young
chester
i
may
be
wrong
as
the
boy
did
nt
make
much
of
an
impression
on
me
that
however
seems
to
bear
out
my
contention
i
remember
the
bright
students
that
s
natural
professor
well
thanks
a
lot
you
too
principal
johnny
left
the
school
and
rejoined
sam
who
had
climbed
out
of
the
flivver
a
near
by
window

you
make
out
johnny
so
so
anyway

got
their
addresses

groaned

this
requires
a
clear
head

on
pile
into
the
bus

turned
right
and
consulted
the
house

a
rundown
two
story
brick
building
which
had
a
printing
plant
on
the
first
floor
there
were
two
flats
upstairs

was
occupied
by
a
family
named
jablonski
the
woman
who
answered
johnny
s
knock

scarcely
speak

pimply

the
printing
shop

occupied
their
quarters

not
even
know
the
names
of
the
present

johnny
returned
to
the
fliver
and
discovered
that
sam
was
missing
irritably
he
pressed
the
horn
and
sam
popped
out
of
the
saloon
across
the
street
wiping
his
mouth
damn

he
snapped
when

old
coot

and
weighed
five
times
his
age

he
said
wiping
the
bar
with
a
towel
that
had
an
odor
of
stale
beer
strong
enough
to
asphyxiate
a
man
two
beers

some
talk

pal
tells

lived

in
the
past
tense

a
bright
boy

that

twenty
years

johnny
gulped
some
of
his
beer
to
cool
off
then
he
tried
again

it
slow
now
what
became
of
jimmie

his
ma
moved
away
after
the
old
man
was
killed
by
walkin
in
front
of
a
streetcar
when
he
had
a
drop
too
much
johnny
contemplated
heaving
the
beer
mug
through
the
nicely
decorated
back
bar
mirror
he
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
i
ll
give
you
one
more
chance
he
said
grimly
archibald
fitzgerald
who
lived
right
around
the
corner
on
sedgwick
street
would
you
mr
fitzgerald
cried
the
saloon
keeper
now
there
s
a
man
ye
can
be
proud
of
maybe
he
did
squeeze
a
money
and
he
got
somewhere
with
it
johnny
regarded
the
bartender
darkly
where
did
he
get
are
you
joking
you
mean
to
say
you
never
heard
of
mister
archibald
fitzgerald
him
that
s
so
rich
and
made
it
all
in
the
stock
market
when
everybody
was
losing
their
shirts
including
meself
who
took
a
little
flyer
in
gramatan
silver
and
had
to
borrow
from
the
brewery
to
keep
goin
hold
to
cm
ai
nt
it
a
shame
she
s
having
herself
such
a
big
time
with
the
wilson
pulchritude
me
i
say
it
was
a
hellish
cruelty
not
to
put
you
at
the
bigptable
with
the
old
folks
where
that
marvelous
mrs
florian
is
of
course
it
s
perfectly
natural
for
you
to
go
goofy
over
her
hatcher
because
it
runs
in
your
family
i
hear
what
oh
yes
lennie
said
my
mother
told
me
yesterday
that
just
before
the
giddy
sarah
started
in
marrying
around
everywhere
she
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
to
one
of
your
relatives
one
of
my
rel
the
recollection
of
wild
imaginings
of
his
own
rushed
upon
the
staggered
hatcher
you
re
crazy
my
father
my
father
never
your
father
lennie
was
first
astounded
then
uproarious
why
s
even
older
than
she
is
how
long
since
your
father
was
a
bachelor
and
in
a
position
to
be
engaged
to
anybody
about
twenty
five
years
her
laughter
was
louder
and
louder
no
little
rollo
it
was
nt
your
father
everybody
thought
she
was
going
to
marry
it
was
your
uncle
just
only
your
uncle
that
s
all
you
hatcher
began
but
his
self
possession
was
gone
in
a
quavering
voice
you
re
just
crazy
was
all
that
he
was
able
to
say
no
dearie
lennie
returned
smiling
upon
him
cruelly
it
was
my
mother
told
me
look
at
her
she
s
sitting
at
the
big
mature
table
next
to
your
own
poor
father
that
you
ve
been
traducing
does
nt
she
look
fairly
sane
she
told
me
it
was
never
announced
but
everybody
was
sure
mr
victor
linley
and
the
giddy
sarah
were
just
about
to
put
up
the
banns
when
bingo
the
gal
mexican
she
never
never
in
her
life
married
a
mexican
lennie
leaped
at
the
chance
he
gave
her
never
in
her
whole
life
not
once
not
one
single
mexican
just
stuck
to
french
and
span
you
re
a
marvel
i
locher
contrived
to
interrupt
and
horribly
aware
that
he
was
trembling
all
over
steadied
his
hands
by
resting
them
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
just
to
think
that
all
this
noise
could
come
from
such
a
little
chest
and
throat
sweet
of
nam
lennie
squealed
i
wish
you
could
see
your
face
goggy
eyed
over
sacrilege
what
here
s
a
cute
one
for
you
adorable
it
s
by
special
request
that
your
uncle
victor
s
sitting
next
to
the
guest
of
honor
ii
hose
special
request
presh
why
hers
aunt
eleanor
could
nt
help
telling
piquant
what
under
the
circumstances
would
nt
it
be
rapturous
and
maybe
some
day
you
ll
be
calling
her
aunt
sarah
what
a
cut
up
you
are
hatcher
had
strength
enough
to
say
savagely
as
he
turned
his
shoulder
upon
her
cackling
voices
blasphemed
in
sacred
hidden
grottoes
where
he
was
an
acolyte
his
nerves
seemed
to
rock
he
was
bewildered
insulted
thrown
down
stamped
upon
and
scarified
with
lennie
s
laughter
stinging
into
his
reddened
left
ear
he
swung
to
mary
gilpin
a
movement
that
was
in
reality
a
flight
for
shelter
behind
this
always
cool
high
minded
girl
he
hoped
to
collect
himself
and
be
at
least
a
little
ready
if
lennie
struck
again
i
suppose
you
ve
heard
some
of
the
tripe
i
ve
been
talking
with
that
pinwheel
on
the
other
side
of
me
he
asked
yes
mary
gilpin
said
if
you
re
really
worried
about
mrs
florian
s
age
hatcher
i
think
you
can
calculateit
with
some
accuracy
i
had
nt
happened
to
hear
that
course
it
s
legendary
what
flutters
he
caused
for
years
after
he
came
home
from
the
last
war
i
believe
though
mrs
florian
was
nt
much
over
twenty
two
or
twenty
three
the
first
time
she
was
married
and
left
here
and
she
s
been
away
only
a
dozen
years
or
so
you
see
that
comes
fairly
close
she
could
easily
be
no
more
than
thirty
five
or
even
as
young
as
thirty
four
i
m
not
interested
i
m
not
interested
in
people
s
ages
no
hatcher
of
course
everybody
s
been
talking
about
her
these
weeks
she
s
been
home
though
i
understandthey
always
did
even
when
she
was
quite
a
young
girl
she
s
the
sort
of
person
who
creates
that
creates
what
talk
mary
said
she
emanates
something
everybody
sgot
to
look
at
her
it
s
as
if
she
herself
so
intensely
feels
that
she
s
the
star
of
the
play
that
her
emotional
conviction
of
her
starship
spreads
a
thought
her
just
at
the
moment
but
they
re
all
conscious
of
her
all
the
time
and
she
could
hardly
bear
it
if
they
were
nt
you
see
that
inevitably
makes
anybody
who
s
much
seen
with
her
talked
about
too
do
nt
be
angry
with
lennie
though
she
s
only
being
loyal
loyal
what
a
ridiculous
no
mary
gilpin
said
she
s
not
the
only
one
who
could
feel
hurt
on
dorcy
s
account
hatcher
what
he
stared
at
her
hotly
on
dorcy
s
account
why
dorcy
why
weeks
ago
she
practically
dropped
me
for
he
laughed
roughly
oh
what
s
it
matter
mary
gave
him
a
steady
look
are
you
going
to
let
dorcy
go
let
her
go
what
do
you
lean
i
have
nt
got
her
never
did
have
she
s
are
you
mary
gilpin
asked
arc
for
cripe
s
sake
i
atelier
felt
he
had
enough
to
bear
without
having
these
two
girls
try
to
make
him
feel
guilty
guilty
of
what
had
nt
he
a
right
to
his
own
life
what
was
everybody
trying
to
do
to
him
see
here
he
began
i
ve
always
been
dorcy
s
friend
and
always
will
be
but
i
certainly
into
his
left
ward
ribs
little
lennie
aldrich
spiked
her
elbow
again
listen
ca
nt
you
listen
even
to
the
music
what
music
from
a
corridor
outside
the
dining
room
there
came
the
strains
of
a
harp
a
flute
a
violin
that
s
what
we
got
to
think
about
and
talk
about
did
i
ever
have
any
other
reason
it
s
for
them
that
i
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
if
i
can
make
a
go
of
it
i
can
give
them
what
i
want
them
to
have
and
what
you
ought
to
want
them
to
have
too
i
want
to
do
my
share
nobody
s
asking
you
to
do
anything
i
know
that
when
you
re
able
you
ll
be
only
too
glad
to
do
anything
you
can
but
now
did
i
say
one
word
about
it
did
i
mildred
there
s
one
thing
i
can
do
want
to
do
it
i
can
see
that
you
have
a
place
to
sleep
and
that
the
kids
have
and
that
nobody
can
take
it
away
from
you
i
want
to
give
you
the
house
mildred
caught
wholly
by
surprise
wanted
to
laugh
and
wanted
to
cry
the
house
had
long
ceased
to
be
a
possession
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
it
was
a
place
that
she
lived
in
and
that
crushed
her
beneath
interest
taxes
and
upkeep
that
bert
with
a
straight
face
should
offer
it
to
her
at
this
time
struck
her
as
merely
grotesque
and
yet
she
remembered
what
mrs
gessler
had
said
and
knew
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
man
and
his
pride
she
got
up
suddenly
went
over
and
put
her
arms
around
him
you
do
nt
have
to
do
that
mildred
i
want
to
if
you
want
to
there
s
only
one
thing
i
can
do
and
that
is
i
want
you
to
know
that
all
right
but
you
ve
got
to
take
it
i
m
sorry
i
said
what
i
did
about
mrs
biederhof
i
ve
been
hating
myself
for
what
i
said
about
wally
christ
i
know
there
d
never
be
anything
between
you
and
that
fat
slob
but
we
keep
saying
things
that
s
it
that
we
do
nt
mean
that
we
could
nt
mean
bert
do
nt
you
think
i
hate
this
just
as
much
as
you
do
but
it
s
got
to
be
for
their
sake
yeah
for
their
sake
they
talked
low
and
close
for
a
long
time
and
then
got
to
laughing
over
the
way
he
looked
when
she
hit
him
with
the
dough
then
they
got
to
laughing
over
the
charges
she
would
have
to
bring
and
the
cruelties
he
had
been
guilty
of
i
guess
you
ll
have
to
hit
her
and
caused
her
great
mental
and
physical
anguish
you
talk
like
veda
she
s
always
wanting
to
be
hit
i
m
glad
there
s
a
little
of
me
in
her
he
doubled
his
fist
brushed
her
chin
with
it
then
they
both
burst
into
shaking
uncontrollable
sobs
the
gams
the
gams
your
face
ai
nt
news
it
was
a
moment
before
mildred
quite
knew
what
was
meant
but
then
she
gave
her
skirt
a
little
hitch
and
was
nt
exactly
displeasedwhen
a
photographer
whistled
mrs
gessler
having
no
gams
to
speak
of
stood
behind
her
and
the
bulbs
went
off
next
thing
she
knew
she
was
in
court
raising
her
hand
swearing
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
help
her
god
and
giving
her
name
address
and
occupation
which
she
described
as
housewife
then
she
was
answering
questions
put
to
her
by
sympathetic
red
haired
man
who
gently
urged
her
to
tell
an
elderly
judge
the
story
of
bert
s
unendurablecruelties
his
silences
during
which
he
would
nt
speak
to
her
for
days
on
end
his
absences
from
home
his
striking
her
in
an
argument
over
money
then
she
was
sitting
beside
wally
and
mrs
gessler
was
up
there
corroborating
everything
she
said
with
just
the
right
shade
of
repressed
indignation
when
mrs
gessler
got
to
the
blow
and
wally
asked
her
sternly
if
she
had
actually
seen
it
she
closed
her
eyes
and
whispered
i
did
then
mildred
and
mrs
gessler
were
out
in
the
corridor
where
wally
presently
joined
them
o
k
decree
s
entered
my
so
soon
that
s
how
it
goes
when
you
got
a
properly
prepared
ease
no
trouble
about
a
divorce
if
it
s
handled
right
the
law
says
cruelty
and
that
s
what
you
got
to
prove
but
that
s
all
you
got
to
prove
argument
he
drove
them
home
and
mildred
made
drinks
and
bert
came
in
to
sign
papers
she
was
glad
somehow
that
since
the
real
estate
deal
started
wally
had
been
curiously
silent
about
romance
it
permitted
her
to
sit
beside
bert
without
any
sense
of
deceit
and
really
feel
friendly
toward
him
the
first
chance
she
got
she
whispered
in
his
ear
i
told
them
the
property
settlementhad
been
reached
out
of
court
the
reporters
i
mean
was
that
all
right
perfectly
that
this
elegant
announcement
should
come
out
in
the
papers
she
knew
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
she
patted
his
hand
and
he
patted
back
wally
left
and
then
bert
after
a
wistfullook
at
his
glass
decided
he
had
to
go
too
but
something
caught
in
mildred
s
throat
as
he
went
down
the
walk
his
hat
at
what
was
intended
to
be
a
jaunty
angle
his
shoulders
thrown
bravely
back
mrs
gessler
i
do
nt
know
i
feel
as
though
i
d
picked
his
bones
first
his
kids
and
then
his
car
and
now
the
house
and
everything
he
s
got
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
good
the
house
would
do
him
on
the
first
call
for
interest
he
d
lose
it
would
nt
he
but
he
looked
so
pitiful
baby
they
all
do
that
s
what
gets
us
pt
was
a
hot
morning
in
october
her
last
at
the
restaurant
the
previous
two
weeks
had
been
a
mad
scramble
in
which
it
had
seemed
she
would
never
find
time
for
all
she
had
to
do
there
had
been
visits
to
los
angeles
street
to
order
the
to
be
some
where
of
course
she
s
somewhere
charlotte
spoke
in
the
firm
unsweetened
tones
she
reserved
for
a
crisis
she
ca
nt
possibly
be
lost
if
she
d
had
an
accident
we
should
have
heard
from
the
hospital
she
called
a
taxi
asa
uttered
the
words
as
if
they
were
wrung
out
of
him
mrs
dayton
says
she
had
her
call
a
taxi
and
went
off
in
it
he
hesitated
and
added
in
an
expressionlessvoice
she
took
the
suitcase
but
the
dresses
were
to
be
altered
they
were
nt
altered
she
did
nt
open
her
charlotte
s
whisper
drained
away
with
a
moaning
sound
yet
in
spite
of
her
horror
of
mystery
she
could
tell
herself
that
she
did
not
really
love
stanley
william
loved
her
in
his
peculiar
way
which
strangely
enough
seemed
to
her
gluttonous
yes
that
was
the
only
word
for
it
but
his
wife
had
never
loved
the
child
not
even
when
she
was
an
adorable
smiling
baby
in
a
cap
and
coat
of
white
fur
it
was
william
notwithstanding
his
thick
husk
of
vanity
who
would
be
hurt
by
what
hap
pened
or
did
not
happen
to
stanley
for
william
loved
his
niece
as
an
old
man
loves
the
remembered
ecstasy
of
his
youth
why
i
saw
her
myself
william
growled
knotting
his
forehead
until
his
eyebrows
hung
like
tufts
of
dried
grass
over
the
blinking
anger
in
his
eyes
i
saw
her
as
i
was
coming
out
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
later
than
usual
and
it
must
have
been
six
o
clock
her
way
downtown
in
peter
s
car
peter
was
driving
and
bless
my
soul
i
noticed
him
because
he
almost
ran
into
a
truck
at
the
corner
of
seventh
and
washington
grazed
it
by
an
inch
i
called
to
baxter
to
stop
when
the
car
skidded
into
the
gutter
rattlebrained
driving
if
ever
i
saw
it
sir
what
i
can
never
understand
is
how
a
man
who
drives
like
that
should
be
able
to
cut
up
people
without
killing
them
but
they
re
all
rattlebrained
now
the
whole
bunch
of
them
i
was
just
saying
to
my
wife
when
you
came
in
that
all
this
modern
racket
and
stanley
s
no
better
than
the
rest
of
em
sticks
in
my
gizzard
then
peter
must
know
where
she
was
going
charlotte
murmured
why
do
nt
you
ask
peter
asa
smiled
faintly
but
his
smile
was
scarcely
more
than
an
ironic
flicker
over
the
stiffened
mask
of
his
features
we
ca
nt
ask
not
come
back
where
s
he
gone
thundered
william
he
had
a
call
out
of
town
dr
bellamy
i
think
he
said
called
him
to
operate
he
told
roy
he
might
not
get
home
till
this
morning
but
this
morning
he
did
nt
come
he
has
not
come
tonight
it
s
half
past
nine
now
william
drew
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
indignantly
it
s
a
quarter
to
ten
he
may
still
come
charlotte
suggested
feebly
i
do
nt
know
asa
s
gaze
wandered
round
the
room
and
came
to
rest
on
her
bulging
figure
seated
like
some
emblem
of
domestic
security
on
her
plum
colored
cushions
i
called
up
bellamy
well
well
i
said
sir
william
s
face
had
flushed
from
gray
to
purple
while
he
lifted
a
shaking
hand
to
pluck
unsteadilyat
his
collar
button
sliding
from
her
chair
to
her
uncertain
feet
glass
if
water
which
she
held
to
her
husband
s
lips
this
is
the
only
thing
except
his
own
flesh
that
could
hurt
william
she
thought
if
anything
has
happened
to
stanley
he
could
nt
tell
me
asa
answered
slowly
he
did
nt
know
he
said
he
had
nt
asked
him
to
operate
out
of
town
had
nt
asked
him
do
you
mean
asa
moistened
his
lips
but
they
were
still
so
stiff
that
he
had
to
wait
a
minute
before
replying
i
do
nt
mean
anything
i
do
nt
know
anything
i
m
in
a
in
a
william
s
features
were
suddenly
convulsed
as
if
he
were
choking
you
ve
got
to
mean
something
he
burst
out
damn
it
all
sir
you
ve
got
to
mean
something
the
explosion
left
asa
unshaken
he
was
the
color
of
wood
that
has
herself
rambling
and
the
smudges
under
his
eyes
looked
as
if
they
had
been
rubbed
in
with
charcoal
men
are
so
helpless
in
trouble
she
thought
with
a
sigh
why
is
it
when
they
spend
all
their
lives
facing
facts
that
they
should
never
have
learned
how
to
meet
an
emergency
i
thought
you
might
have
heard
something
asa
was
saying
but
you
ca
nt
think
they
re
together
charlotte
cried
out
you
ca
nt
think
she
s
gone
off
with
with
peter
asa
shook
his
head
again
i
ca
nt
think
i
ve
stopped
thinking
but
stanley
could
nt
she
she
is
nt
she
is
nt
like
that
i
do
nt
know
what
she
s
like
asa
s
voice
was
hard
and
level
i
do
nt
know
what
anybody
is
like
she
s
like
all
the
others
william
stormed
while
charlotteunderstood
as
she
her
uneasy
marriage
she
had
seen
her
husband
stripped
to
the
bone
stripped
even
of
that
masculine
vanity
which
he
had
worn
always
like
a
protective
layer
of
fat
but
if
that
girl
by
god
charlotte
if
a
niece
of
mine
do
nt
william
please
william
an
impending
nameless
fear
had
yielded
to
the
immediate
horror
of
an
apoplectic
stroke
under
her
very
eyes
you
will
make
yourself
sick
a
smothered
gurgling
and
rumbling
issued
from
william
s
throat
i
tell
you
i
tell
you
asa
stood
up
and
straightened
his
shoulders
i
ll
go
now
he
said
quietly
there
does
nt
seem
to
be
anything
else
i
can
do
where
s
craig
asked
charlotte
with
her
apprehensive
glance
on
her
husband
craig
it
was
the
first
moment
that
any
of
them
had
thought
of
craig
he
s
waiting
for
me
outside
what
does
he
say
he
suddenly
was
no
longer
the
simple
warm
light
hearted
brother
whom
he
thought
he
knew
so
well
he
was
shocked
to
realize
how
little
he
really
knew
about
this
brother
of
his
with
could
remember
he
was
afraid
he
wished
that
he
had
never
heard
them
talking
this
way
he
thought
of
the
lake
and
believed
that
he
would
never
go
near
it
again
he
remembered
how
boys
who
were
unwise
enough
to
go
swimming
in
its
waters
always
broke
out
in
a
rash
over
their
bodies
and
fishermen
said
that
the
fish
in
this
lake
were
poisoned
and
no
good
he
shuddered
at
his
own
thoughts
ernie
stopped
the
car
in
front
of
the
house
rain
do
nt
seem
to
be
letting
up
none
we
better
run
for
it
do
nt
forget
your
raincoat
there
on
the
floor
they
clattered
up
onto
the
porch
together
and
molly
met
them
at
the
door
did
nt
you
see
him
anywhere
down
around
the
lake
pernie
you
ai
nt
seen
nothing
of
mr
higgins
today
have
you
molly
s
gloom
spread
a
damper
over
all
of
them
ernie
stayed
but
a
few
minutes
and
when
he
left
she
followed
him
out
onto
the
the
street
into
the
drizzle
of
rain
as
if
she
expected
to
see
the
bent
figure
of
jud
higgins
coming
along
the
sidewalk
when
she
came
in
she
said
we
better
leave
the
front
door
unlocked
in
case
mr
higgins
comes
home
sometime
before
morning
the
family
trooped
upstairs
to
bed
and
the
last
thing
before
she
put
out
the
lights
and
climbed
the
stairs
molly
went
out
to
the
little
bedroom
off
the
kitchen
and
looked
at
jud
s
empty
bed
not
quite
empty
for
tonight
the
old
cat
slept
there
undisturbed
she
moved
to
put
him
out
and
then
she
thought
better
of
it
the
skinny
old
cat
sleeping
peacefully
there
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
legs
sprawled
stiffly
seemed
to
her
symbolic
of
old
jud
himself
she
decided
to
let
him
remain
there
warm
and
comfortable
against
the
storm
just
as
she
was
hoping
that
jud
himself
had
found
a
refuge
this
night
against
the
weather
she
sighed
a
little
switched
off
the
kitchen
light
and
went
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
kenny
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
smoked
a
cigarette
while
carl
undressed
silently
it
was
far
too
early
in
the
night
for
the
prospect
of
sleep
to
appear
inviting
to
kenny
he
felt
peculiarly
alert
and
wakeful
but
it
was
no
concern
over
jud
higgins
that
kept
him
so
carl
climbed
into
bed
on
the
other
side
and
turned
his
back
on
his
brother
pulling
the
covers
up
over
him
kenny
sat
still
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
wriggled
his
toes
in
his
socks
watching
their
busy
agile
movements
appreciatively
carl
tossed
the
covers
back
suddenly
and
flopped
over
on
his
back
in
the
bed
shielding
his
eyes
against
the
light
in
the
crook
of
his
elbow
for
god
s
sakes
you
coming
to
bed
or
are
you
gon
na
set
up
there
all
night
with
that
light
on
well
i
ll
tell
you
i
ai
nt
decided
yet
see
at
the
coldness
the
fit
of
nervous
fear
that
he
had
experienced
earlier
in
the
evening
he
repeated
the
words
that
kenny
had
just
spoken
over
and
over
in
his
mind
studying
his
brother
s
strong
back
while
he
did
so
after
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
that
he
recalled
them
he
found
something
hard
and
sinister
in
the
words
something
quite
to
be
expected
in
the
way
of
conversation
from
a
man
who
consorted
with
murderers
and
mobsters
the
sudden
vivid
thought
image
of
the
two
limp
bloody
bodies
slipping
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
sinking
silently
to
the
bottom
of
the
very
lake
that
he
had
looked
at
every
day
of
his
life
gave
him
a
nasty
start
and
turned
his
mouth
dry
kenny
turned
around
to
him
suddenly
what
in
hell
s
the
matter
with
you
tonight
anyway
your
eyes
look
like
a
scared
cat
s
you
look
like
you
got
the
jitters
right
carl
stared
back
at
kenny
fascinated
it
seemed
to
him
that
kenny
s
half
dosed
blue
eyes
had
a
power
to
all
surprised
at
kenny
s
next
words
what
s
the
matter
you
ai
nt
still
thinking
about
that
stuff
ernie
and
me
was
talking
about
tonight
are
you
carl
s
mouth
sagged
open
foolishly
and
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
his
brother
s
face
kenny
appeared
slightly
bewildered
look
he
said
helplessly
what
you
worrying
about
stuff
like
that
for
it

a
little
kid
it
s
all
done
with
now
there
ai

been
no

around
this

since

but
the
fear
was
still
there
before
his
eyes
plain
on
carl

face
you
ai
nt
worried
about
what
i
said
about
a
couple
of
stiffs

of
the

carl
worked
he
kept
staring
at
kenny
fascinated
and
horror
stricken
kenny
was
completely
baffled
by
something
soft
and
sensitivein
his
brother
that
was
beyond
his
understanding
you
ai
nt
thinking
about
that
stuff
ernie
was
feeding
me
about
me
getting
hurt
some
day
and
ending
up
in
a
morgue
some
place
it
s
a
lot
of
baloney
ernie
just
likes
to
hear
himself
talk
there
ai
nt
nothing
to
it
i
got
lots
of
different
kinds
of
friends
it
never
made
no
difference
to
me
what
a
guy
did
so
long
as
i
liked
him
but
no
guy
is
gon
na
shoot

full
of
holes
or
nothing

lieutenant
conrad
came
in
to
report
he
took
in
the
situation
and
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
when

abruptly
dismissed
the

polly
flew
to
monte
and
clutched
his

withdrew
reluctantly
when

were
gone
conrad
said

about
finished
the

decker
is
finishing
the
last

looks
like
the
whole
hotel
had
a
good
night
s
rest
so
far
nothing
to
poke
holes
in
doc
wants
to
know
if
you

got
any
objections
if
they
take
the

now
the
boat
s
leaving
with
a
load
of

and
it

as
well
go
along
with

when

had

consent
he
continuedbluntly

the
rest
of
the

is
lousy
with

you
ca
nt
get
much
of
a
lead
from
that
but
your
guess
about
the

seems
pretty
good
those
are

the
arm
of

i
d
say
he
was
shot
there
and
then
heaved
under
the
table
though
the
devil
knows
why
to
hide
him
ray
spoke
impatiently
as
though
he
had
gone
far
ahead
of
conrad
s
slow
exposition
they
did
nt
want
him
found
until
morning
but
why
i
ll
know
a
lot
when
i
know
that
ray
replied
shortly
he
was
beginning
to
show
the
strain
of
his
all
night
vigil
conrad
fingered
his
pipe
shot
ray
a
look
and
then
remarked
well

signified
that
she
understood
when
they
came
to
the
rotunda
she
dashed
down
the
hall
that
led
to
the
rear
of
the
building
while
denny
made
for
his
room
he
half
hoped
that
the
death
in
the
house
would
put
a
ban
on
the
music
making
but
he
suspected
paine
would
nt
allow
it
he
nicked
himself
a
couple
of
times
in
his
haste
which
did
nt
improve
his
mood
when
he
arrived
on
the
terrace
spruce
enough
and
with
the
usual
required
boutonniere
he
found
the
dancing
floor
was
crowded
jim
baxter
favored
denny
with
a
distinctly
sour
look
he
could
nt
tolerate
tardiness
and
denny
disguise
the
bleeding

was
definitely
below

at

he
muttered
while
he
bounced
around
on
his
seat
on
with
the
dance
though

breaking
shut
up
denny
replied
as
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
jim
s
thunderous
expression
they
played
three
numbers
and
then
when
the
crowd
kept
clapping
two
encores
after
that
jim
ignored
them
and
the
couples
sauntered
back
to
their
tables

gay
teddy
said
continuing
his
monologue
what
s
the
big
idea
the
callousness
of
denny
kicked
him
in
the
shin
whereupon
he
lapsed
into
an
injured
silence
concealed
behind
denny
s
broad
back
jim
had
come
up
and
was
looking
his
reproof
denny
accepted
it
meekly
i
thought
we
d
be
in
mourning
today
he
remarked
jim
merely
handed
the
notes
to
denny
practiced
it
this
morning
denny
felt
his
ears
burn
he
d
even
forgotten
that
jim
had
called
a
special
rehearsal
something
he
did
once
in
a
bluemurder
makes
us
gay
moon
well
a
man
is
nt
murdered
every
day
that
ought
to
be
a
valid
excuse
except
for
the
suppressed
excitement
in
the
atmosphere
the
hotel
life
was
going
on
as
usual
the
scene
was
just
the
same
with
the
same
cliques
sitting
together
the
same
routine
of
chatter
laughter
and
drink
the
gay
young
things
the
sedate
old
things
and
the
smart
in
between
things
carrying
out
their
various
performances
the
only
really
big
change
was
the
fact
that
polly
and
monte
did
nt
do
the
rhumba
the
hour
ran
over
to
one
thirty
and
people
still
thronged
the
terrace
when
the
musicians
put
up
their
instruments
and
strode
off
for
their
lunch
jim
remarked
to
denny
chesty
was
sure
the
season
would
be
killed
it
looks
like
just
the
opposite
guests
were
getting
bored
now
they
ve
got
do
nt
get
scared
off
by
a
little
murder
if
anything
it
give
the
season
a
lift
denny
agreed
with
him
and
the
afternoon
proved
he
was
right
not
only
reporters
arrived
by
the
boatloads
but
there
was
a
sudden
request
for
rooms
paine
of
course
did
nothing
to
discourage
the
trade
and
ray
had
no
reason
to
forbid
new
arrivals
at
four
denny
found
ray
sequestered
in
his
room
in
the
village
and
surrounded
by
reports
the
air
was
blue
with
smoke
when
denny
came
in
his
set
expression
relaxed
he
folded
his
arms
behind
his
head
and
indulged
in
a
tremendous
stretch
phew
i
never
met
up
with
a
case
like
this
one
denny
undid
his
tie
and
unbuttoned
his
shirt
before
he
sat
down
it
s
as
hot
as
hell
in
here
and
stinks
too
how
can
you
think
ray
looked
surprised
and
sniffed
oh
that
smell
is
from
the
landlady
something
she
cooks
i
m
well
i
guess
you
can
get
used
to
anything
denny
admitted
tell
me
about
the
case
any
news
from
naylor
ray
brought
down
his
arms
and
leaned
over
his
notes
not
yet
i
m
surprised
because
mclaughlin
has
sent
out
a
description
of
him
and
it
ca
nt
be
difficult
to
recognize
that
setup
even
if
he
fell
yet
voiceless
words
emanated
from
the
insentient

of

the
excruciating
pain
over
her
heart
became
less
one
breath
and
then
another
came
without
that
scraping
pain
of
gravel
on
raw
flesh
that
breathing
had
been
since
her
child
died
it
had
also
been
somewhat
difficult
to

the

of
waiting

the
death
of

the

blown
the

tapping
along

and
then
down
the

each
to
his

far
from

come
in

clicked
into

at

bottom
of

through
the

into
the

hall
came
the
odor
of
steak
and
potatoes
frying
there
was
a
rice
pudding
cooling
on
the
alone
by
the
fire
her
place
was
empty
she
would
go
home
what
a
fool
she
was
how
blind
not
to
know
that
was
the
only
place
in
the
whole
crazed
and
senseless

the

in

of

from
which
she
would
see
once
more
the
wyoming
valley
the
train
slowed
for
the
curve
and
the
grade
before
her
in
its
own
dream
lay
the
valley
the
shadows
of
great
violet
based
clouds
made
dark
islands
across
the
little
knolls
and
undulations
which
rippled
down
the

the

descended
along
the
ridge
everywhere
the
white
smoke
more
alive
than
ostrich
feathers
rose
from
the
collieries
here
was
a
presentation
on
a
giant
scale
a

pageant

quoted
in
a

even
when
she
was
in

and
he
still
as
near
as
the
ypres
salient

everything
changed
not
many
would
bother
but
some
would
remember
that
luke
had
walked
out
on
her
and
would
not
realize
that
to
her
it
no
longer
mattered
her
husband
was
dead

also
died

realize
it
was
better
that
she
had
not
been

an

obligations

would
feel

sally
winlock
her
father
looking
much
grayer
even
in
the
first
flash
was
standing
gazing
up
through
the
car
windows
as
the
train
pulled
in
she
recognized
the
gabled
station
with
colored
tile
entrance
the
old
smell
of
hurry
and
luggage
the
same
old
bawled
lists
of
stations
still
to
come
wilkes
barre

scranton
carbondale
and
the
deafening
sound
of
escaping
steam
assaulted
her
ears
she
saw
the
white
cloud
of
steam
in
the
selfsame
place
where
she
and
luke
had
realized
each
other
s
presence
in
eden
when
they
reached
the
big
house
into
the
side
hall
her
father
holding
her
arm
they
went
into
the
library
she
looked
around
she
placed
her
stool
by
her
father
s
chair
and
sat
down
as
though
she
were
still
ten
years
old
celestine
had
died
so
long
ago
david
had
died
their

william

took

said
as
though
they
were
the
same
age
now
william
he
touched
her
hair
almost
as
though
he
might
be
rebuffed
your
hair
he
said
your
hair
that
was
all
then
he
added
you
were
always
the
sunlight
of
this
house
at
last
in
a
coruscated
voice
she
whispered
there
s
no
hour
or

spare
or
be

of

a

your

hymns
like
the

your
grandmothers
were
both
as
fine
as
they
come
they
were
talking
desperately
and
at
random
anything
was
better
than
the
freighted
silence
she
spoke
again
your

never
started
to

in
mine

the
night
of
a
disaster
at

everything

be
given
in
the
terms
of
what
it
has
cost
whole
world
you
can
go
on
trying
to
breathe
one
thing
you
have
nt
thought
as
the
wisteria
he
spread
some
honey
on
a
piece
of
toast
and
the
golden
taste
made
him
think
of
spring
in
general
the
season
pricketh
every
gentle
heart
and
maketh
him
out
of
his
sleep
to
start
he
repeated
to
himself
and
suddenly
there
was
a
warm
rush
of
emotion
to
his
heart
now
god
bless
the
spring
he
thought
god
bless
it
it
was
indeed
the
season
of
resurrection
a
symbol
to
all
those
who
had
ears
to
hear
and
eyes
to
see
no
man
or
woman
should
ever
become
entirely
old
or
utterly
hopeless
so
long
as
there
was
spring
to
look
forward
to
or
back
upon
and
was
nt
the
minds
of
gentle
men
all
through
the
ages
nothing
could
ever
completely
cut
that
cord
of
light
no
amount
of
temporary
brutality
or
barbarism
between
gentle
men
and
women
dead
living
and
to
come
there
were
a
number
of
these
cords
of
light
they
were
like
a
secret
radio
code
five
hundred
years
ago
a
gentle
poet
thought
felix
chaucer
felt
the
spring
as
i
am
feeling
it
now
he
lit
a
pipe
and
read
the
morning
s
news
england
was
still
enjoying
a
spell
of
unprecedented
good
weather
and
the
english
unused
to
this
had
turned
from
rejoicing
to
gloom
the
nation
was
deeply
stirred
stocks
were
unsteady
felix
wondered
if
they
had
ever
been
anything
else
hitler
had
made
another
speech
now
that
the
abused
and
homesick
austrians
had
been
taken
back
to
the
broad
bosom
of
their
racial
mother
germany
had
no
further
territorial
ambitions
any
one
who
said
she
had
was
a
liar
he
thank
a
famous
psychopathologist
in
chicago
had
announced
that
america
had
a
deteriorating
social
system
only
the
totalitarian
states
seemed
determined
to
eliminate
the
unfit
and
produce
real
men
herr
goebbels
had
been
slapped
by
the
husband
of
another
actress
the
spring
social
season
in
philadelphia
was
reaching
a
climax
it
occupied
a
full
page
felix
refilled
his
pipe
and
went
up
to
the
second
story
front
sitting
room
to
write
some
letters
he
was
badly
behind
in
his
correspondence
carl
s
note
of
welcome
had
been
amusing
and
typical
to
the
sound
of
cymbals
and
the
aroma
of
the
fatted
calf
carl
had
written
i
welcome
you
it
s
the
only
fatted
calf
you
ll
get
but
do
nt
tell
your
fellow
citizens
they
would
resent
my
presumption
who
am
ito
welcome
any
one
to
their
city
i
am
not
a
philadelphian
i
was
born
in
albany
and
i
have
never
really
lived
in
philadelphia
merely
on
the
outskirts
and
then
as
no
more
than
a
none
of
the
voluble
contempt
of
the
virginians
nor
have
they
the
candid
and
courteous
and
dismaying
blandness
of
charleston
and
they
seldom
have
a
trace
of
the
icy
rudeness
of
boston
they
ll
merely
not
elect
you
to
something
it
was
one
o
clock
before
felix
had
finished
reading
his
mail
and
had
answered
part
of
it
and
half
past
two
and
time
for
him
to
get
ready
for
his
appointment
with
the
mysterious
mr
wilde
before
he
was
aware
of
it
he
went
down
into
the
hall
and
put
on
his
coat
reluctantly
he
knew
little
of
the
law
in
all
his
life
come
to
think
of
it
he
had
never
but
once
consulted
a
lawyer
and
then
only
for
the
briefest
of
dealings
his
mother
s
estate
had
been
so
small
he
remembered
the
curt
hurried
young
man
he
had
seen
in
detroit
felix
s
ideas
of
the
profession
were
still
largely
taken
from
dickens
and
the
pleasant
and
leisurely
offices
he
had
known
in
the
village
of
maclean
lawyers
were
either
shrewd
and
kindly
eyes
who
had
been
in
politics
or
else
young
men
of
an
equally
dry
wit
who
were
going
into
politics
he
walked
slowly
up
cassianut
street
to
broad
and
then
north
along
broad
to
chestnut
and
then
west
a
half
a
block
until
he
came
to
the
forbidding
facade
grimy
and
ornate
and
palladian
of
the
gibraltar
trust
company
over
the
magnificent
door
of
wrought
bronze
was
the
motto
fide
et
fiducia
which
no
doubt
explained
why
the
gibraltar
trust
company
had
been
allowed
by
confiding
stockholders
to
build
an
entirely
profitless
office
building
felix
pushed
a
revolving
glass
door
to
the
left
of
the
wrought
bronze
door
and
found
himself
in
a
narrow
hall
where
there
was
a
battery
of
elevators
in
a
gloomy
voice
he
informed
the
operator
of
the
one
he
was
allowed
to
enter
that
he
wished
to
get
off
at
the
eleventh
floor
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
out
whether
business
made
people
formidable
or
formidable
people
entered
business
but
at
all
events
a
singular
lack
of
cheerfulness
no
wonder
periodic
panic
swept
them
like
a
wind
through
a
cave
the
elevator
came
to
a
velvet
stop
and
felix
was
urged
into
a
long
corridor
where
a
series
of
doors
stared
at
him
like
gray
unfriendlyeyes
on
their
upper
panels
of
ground
glass
the
names
wilde
holbrook
mccormick
and
armstead
there
was
not
a
humannote
except
two
discreet
solid
wooden
doors
at
the
farther
end
of
the
corridor
upon
which
in
gold
was
on
the
door
to
the
left
the
word
men
and
on
the
door
to
the
right
the
word
women
felix
hesitated
he
was
nervous
and
for
a
moment
he
had
thought
of
going
to
the
former
and
then
he
changed
his
mind
hat
in
hand
he
timidly
opened
one
of
the
glass
panelled
doors
upon
which
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner
of
the
panel
was
the
word
entrance
he
peered
around
the
door
three
elderly
fates
two
of
them
engaged
in
typewriting
at
him
they
had
the
plumpness
and
unadorned
neatness
of
women
no
longer
interested
in
men
in
their
eyes
was
the
tranquil
indignation
of
cows
interrupted
while
feeding
a
very
moral
office
thought
felix
at
least
on
the
surface
is
mr
wilde
in
he
stuttered
and
slid
around
the
door
moving
remember
what
a
good
time
we
had
christmas
i
remember
betsy
said
what
kind
of
a
job
would
you
get
honey
something
to
do
with
clothes
i
guess
that
s
what
i
d
like
you
ve
always
had
a
knack
well
i
do
nt
see
why
not
bets
i
ll
talk
to
your
father
he
ought
to
be
glad
that
you
ve
got
some
get
up
and
git
yes
yes
i
always
thought
of
it
that
way
maizie
the
one
who
would
make
a
brilliant
marriage
and
have
beautiful
children
you
the
clever
one
my
poor
darlin
maizie
she
certainly
has
nt
got
what
i
ve
wanted
for
her
she
s
got
nothing
you
always
loved
her
more
than
me
betsy
thought
quietly
perhaps
i
wonder
what
are
the
ways
i
wonder
how
you
make
someone
really
love
you
best
of
all
will
daddy
mind
she
said
do
nt
worry
darlin
i
ll
take
care
of
your
father
he
s
mostly
got
over
what
happened
last
winter
but
i
think
it
kind
of
hurts
him
still
might
heal
up
better
if
you
went
away
course
i
ll
miss
you
darlin
terribly
but
i
do
have
the
feeling
this
is
what
you
were
meant
to
do
the
clever
one
i
m
not
clever
betsy
said
but
a
tiny
nerve
jumped
in
her
could
i
be
the
clever
one
clever
betsy
left
for
new
york
the
first
of
june
the
untidy
lilacs
were
all
in
bloom
in
the
yard
the
day
she
left
the
road
was
shimmering
black
with
tar
a
bobwhite
called
from
the
fields
behind
the
house
minnie
may
drove
her
in
to
the
back
bay
station
to
take
the
one
climbed
all
over
her
and
squealed
with
excitement
she
had
said
goodbye
to
tom
jekyll
earlier
before
he
left
to
catch
his
train
after
all
the
months
when
she
realized
he
had
tried
not
to
have
to
look
at
her
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
and
when
she
put
her
head
back
she
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
goodbye
bets
he
said
i
still
feel
as
if
you
were
just
a
little
tike
you
know
going
off
like
this
daddy
she
said
and
kissed
him
again
but
more
than
anything
she
wanted
to
get
away
she
could
nt
begin
to
think
begin
anything
till
she
was
clear
away
and
could
start
fresh
all
the
way
in
to
the
station
minnie
may
talked
steadily
for
they
had
just
heard
the
great
news
maizie
who
had
just
gone
home
was
going
to
have
a
baby
it
overshadowed
everything
else
betsy
realized
that
her
mother
maybe
this
will
fix
everything
up
for
maizie
betsy
said
bets
that
s
what
i
m
prayin
for
it
s
bound
to
make
a
big
difference
the
only
thing
disturbs
me
maizie
looks
so
poorly
it
takes
a
lot
out
of
a
woman
to
go
through
nine
months
of
having
a
baby
i
dread
it
for
her
but
if
it
ll
bring
that
man
around
she
s
going
to
have
to
go
to
dr
cunningham
i
m
going
to
make
her
i
just
know
he
can
do
wonders
for
her
she
s
got
to
do
it
for
her
own
sake
and
my
sake
and
the
baby
s
sake
all
of
our
sakes
they
kissed
goodbye
on
the
gritty
windy
platform
of
the
station
as
the
train
came
roaring
into
the
cave
of
the
back
bay
betsy
remembered
how
the
engine
used
to
rush
in
like
this
when
she
and
leda
march
took
the
train
home
from
school
that
was
long
long
ago
bags
up
on
the
car
platform
and
she
climbed
the
steps
and
turned
at
the
top
to
wave
to
her
mother
minnie
may
waved
back
with
both
hands
and
then
she
walked
away
she
was
going
directly
from
the
station
to
maizie
s
that
october
betsy
used
to
walk
from
the
barrington
hotel
where
she
lived
to
catch
the
lexington
avenue
street
car
to
work
with
the
highest
sense
of
jubilation
she
was
in
a
new
world
there
would
never
be
anything
again
like
those
new
york
mornings
before
nine
the
sun
was
bright
and
the
air
was
sharp
brilliant
and
gay
the
people
hurried
along
the
sidewalks
on
the
way
to
work
in
the
florists
shops
they
were
setting
out
pots
of
bronze
chrysanthemums
there
were
also
orchids
on
display
crammed
lavishly
into
glass
vases
but
they
belonged
to
the
night
world
the
same
new
york
as
the
drawn
shirred
curtains
in
the
big
apartment
houses
where
the
rich
women
were
still
asleep
in
the
mornings
although
sleep
betsy
felt
as
strong
as
ten
men
and
her
heart
was
as
high
as
the
air
and
of
all
the
places
in
the
world
there
were
to
be
in
she
was
glad
to
be
here
she
walked
with
long
vigorous
steps
on
her
high
heels
across
the
freshly
watered
streets
in
her
new
smart
little
tweed
dresses
and
her
little
hats
she
knew
she
looked
like
a
boy
and
she
was
glad
she
felt
like
a
boy
to
be
a
young
girl
in
new
york
in
those
days
was
to
be
like
a
young
boy
as
free
as
unshackled
as
adventurous
she
had
got
a
job
on
a
fashion
magazine
at
twenty
five
dollars
a
week
she
would
stride
in
to
the
big
office
where
her
desk
was
there
were
about
ten
desks
in
this
room
some
of
them
belonged
to
older
women
who
did
the
work
of
copy
reading
proof
correction
who
were
constantly
on
the
telephone
to
the
press
at
the
other
desks
sat
girls
like
betsy
young
and
minds
quick
to
imitate
the
way
things
were
done
they
worked
here
for
small
wages
and
were
glad
to
get
them
for
the
experience
the
prestige
that
a
job
on
lady
gave
them
many
of
the
most
important
women
in
new
york
had
started
out
on
lady
the
advertising
manager
of
one
of
the
biggest
department
stores
papa
gasped
orabella
the
room
as
she
had
promised
in
a
flash
only
pausing
at
the
door
to
whisper
with
uplifted
finger
and
eyes
dancing
with
as
matthew
assumed
the
excitement
of
conspiracy
and
remember
i
rely
on
you
to
be
the
soul
of
kindness
to
my
poor
sister
pally
ralph
burmester
entered
excusing
himself
for
his
tardiness
his
face
wore
a
vexed
abstracted
look
that
made
matthew
wonder
what
accounted
for
the
delay
as
he
glanced
round
the
room
for
his
wife
his
eyebrows
rode
upward
of
course
he
might
have
known
better
than
trust
to
lydia
will
you
drink
sherry
the
ladies
will
be
with
us
shortly
one
would
willingly
wait
if
need
be
for
ever
in
prospect
of
such
a
treat
the
meaningless
compliment
echoing
hollowly
in
its
sober
surroundings
was
not
a
success
ralph
s
face
was
immovable
as
he
crossed
the
room
to
pour
out
the
wine
it
is
not
our
custom
in
he
said
as
though
he
rejected
matthew
s
disclaimer
looking
across
his
shoulder
matthew
observed
that
the
door
through
which
orabella
had
made
her
escape
stood
slightly
ajar
and
guessing
correctlythat
she
was
waiting
behind
it
raised
his
voice
to
reply
on
the
contrary
i
have
had
plenty
of
entertainment
he
paused
deliberately
did
the
door
handle
tremble
in
admiring
your
art
collection
sir
is
that
not
a
guardi
above
the
cabinet
i
see
you
are
an
amateur
of
pictures
it
was
characteristic
of
matthew
to
present
his
superficial
knowledge
to
the
best
advantage
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
that
he
had
identified
the
guardi
among
his
various
ventures
having
been
that
of
art
dealer
in
which
he
succeeded
as
might
be
said
of
many
in
the
present
day
largely
by
lack
of
principle
i
know
nothing
of
art
ralph
to
matthew
s
relief
returned
bluntly
i
buy
a
picture
when
i
like
it
school
means
little
to
me
he
paused
as
though
seeking
a
more
congenial
topic
of
conversation
and
evidently
did
not
find
one
for
he
jerked
at
matthew
abruptly
i
suppose
the
funeral
arrangements
have
now
been
made
lud
i
suppose
so
rejoined
matthew
with
the
distaste
he
always
felt
for
the
intrusion
of
dull
or
unaesthetic
topics
on
a
social
occasion
grimacing
at
provincial
boorishness
he
added
as
you
may
imagine
i
am
the
last
to
be
consulted
but
i
take
it
uncle
jason
has
the
matter
in
hand
i
shall
ever
have
it
on
my
mind
said
ralph
heavily
that
i
was
the
sun
is
my
undoing
instrumental
in
bringing
about
the
death
of
an
old
friend
to
whom
i
owe
more
than
can
readily
be
computed
you
reproach
yourself
unduly
said
matthew
with
a
curious
touch
of
hercules
dignity
that
was
not
lost
on
his
companion
if
anyone
is
to
blame
it
is
myself
af
fair
egad
if
you
had
to
die
which
would
you
choose
to
flicker
out
mournfully
like
a
corpse
candle
to
the
tune
of
prayers
or
to
blaze
to
glory
as
grandfather
did
on
some
supreme
moment
of
satisfaction
there
is
no
point
in
discussing
it
the
thing
is
done
and
i
bitterly
regret
my
share
in
it
be
as
melancholy
about
it
as
you
like
matthew
s
impatience
got
the
better
of
his
courtesy
i
too
loved
my
grandfather
and
owed
him
certain
things
well
i
killed
him
if
you
choose
to
put
it
that
way
i
am
not
one
to
shirk
plain
speaking
i
killed
him
at
a
moment
when
his
life
was
much
more
valuable
to
me
than
his
death
that
i
can
well
believe
ralph
retorted
icily
go
on
believing
it
for
if
as
the
tale
seems
to
go
i
inherit
so
much
as
a
brass
farthing
there
wo
nt
that
t
was
in
view
of
that
i
tumbled
the
old
fellow
into
eternity
he
spoke
brutally
recklessly
because
he
feared
to
be
betrayed
into
emotion
ralph
shook
his
head
if
your
hopes
are
pinned
on
that
you
would
do
better
to
relinquish
them
the
last
time
i
spoke
to
your
grandfather
before
he
had
his
stroke
he
told
me
all
was
willed
to
jason
so
much
the
better
retorted
matthew
though
his
heart
sank
for
i
shall
at
least
get
credit
for
the
purity
of
my
intentions
let
us
change
the
subject
t
is
but
a
poor
prelude
to
a
social
evening
here
comes
my
wife
and
my
daughter
orabella
no
schoolroom
miss
could
have
made
a
more
demure
entrance
in
her
mother
s
shadow
than
miss
orabella
burmester
lydia
bland
and
mild
undisturbed
by
her
own
lateness
or
her
husband
s
displeasure
greeted
the
guest
with
a
warm
simplicity
you
have
been
too
long
welcome
you
look
here
is
little
orry
whom
you
last
remember
with
a
rattle
in
her
hand
now
it
is
on
her
tongue
put
in
ralph
endeavouring
to
recover
his
tenure
as
a
host
he
ruffled
his
daughter
s
curls
as
orabella
with
rashes
lowered
sank
into
her
curtsy
at
the
visitor
s
feet
bristol
save
for
the
absence
of
the
rattle
i
could
have
sworn
t
was
but
a
minute
since
we
met
said
matthew
as
she
rose
orabella
glared
and
in
passing
ground
down
her
little
foot
on
his
as
hers
was
heelless
and
covered
in
satin
he
was
hardly
aware
of
the
pressure
but
where
is
pally
asked
lydia
looking
about
for
her
eldest
daughter
ralph
flashed
her
a
meaningful
glance
which
she
returned
what
have
you
done
with
pally
hers
said
and
his
have
patience
all
will
be
well
you
would
like
to
look
as
matthew
turned
she
held
up
toward
him
a
purring
bundle
soft
with
sleep
and
fire
warmth
lydia
had
gone
to
ralph
and
wag
speaking
to
him
in
a
low
voice
i
hope
you
like
cats
orabella
challengedhim
across
the
kitten
s
ears
which
he
rubbed
as
he
bent
to
re
tort
i
like
some
the
two
legged
sort
hush
here
she
comes
there
was
a
rich
hesitant
rustle
of
all
sounds
the
girl
she
had
help
it
was
a
man
what
did
the
man
look
like
he
pursed
his
lips
and
made
another
steeple
with
his
fingers
he
was
a
middle
aged
man
heavy
set
about
five
feet
seven
inches
tall
and
weighing
around
one
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
ile
said
his
name
was
smith
he
wore
a
blue
suit
black
shoes
a
green
tie
and
shirt
no
hat
there
was
a
brown
bordered
handkerchief
in
his
outer
pocket
his
hair
was
dark
brown
sprinkled
with
gray
there
was
a
bald
patch
about
the
size
of
a
dollar
on
the
crown
of
his
head
and
a
scar
about
two
inches
long
running
down
the
side
of
his
jaw
on
the
left
side
i
think
yes
on
the
left
side
not
bad
i
said
what
about
the
hole
in
his
right
sock
i
omitted
to
take
his
shoes
off
darn
careless
of
you
just
stared
at
each
other
half
curious
half
hostile
like
new
neighbors
then
suddenly
he
went
into
his
laugh
again
the
five
dollar
bill
i
had
given
him
was
still
lying
on
his
side
of
the
desk
i
flicked
a
hand
across
and
took
it
you
wo
nt
want
this
now
i
said
since
we
started
talking
in
thousands
he
stopped
laughing
very
suddenly
then
he
shrugged
at
eleven
a
m
he
said
and
no
tricks
mr
marlowe
the
high
window
do
nt
think
i
do
nt
know
how
to
protect
myself
i
hope
you
do
i
said
because
what
you
are
handling
is
dynamite
i
left
him
and
tramped
across
the
empty
outer
office
and
opened
the
door
and
let
it
shut
staying
inside
there
ought
to
be
footsteps
outside
in
the
corridor
but
his
transom
was
closed
and
i
had
nt
made
much
noise
coming
on
crepe
rubbersoles
i
hoped
he
would
remember
that
i
the
door
between
the
door
and
the
little
closed
typewriter
desk
a
kid
trick
but
once
in
a
while
it
will
work
especially
after
a
lot
of
smart
conversation
full
of
worldliness
and
sly
wit
like
a
sucker
play
in
football
and
if
it
did
nt
work
this
time
we
would
just
be
there
sneering
at
each
other
again
it
worked
nothing
happened
for
a
while
except
that
a
nose
was
blown
then
all
by
himself
in
there
he
went
into
his
sick
rooster
laugh
again
then
a
throat
was
cleared
then
a
swivel
chair
squeaked
and
feet
walked
a
dingy
white
head
poked
into
the
room
about
two
inches
past
the
end
of
the
door
it
hung
there
suspended
and
i
went
into
a
state
of
suspended
animation
then
the
head
was
drawn
back
and
four
unclean
fingernails
came
around
the
edge
of
the
door
and
pulled
the
door
closed
clicked
was
shut
i
started
breathing
again
and
put
my
ear
to
the
wooden
panel
the
swivel
telephone
being
dialed
i
lunged
across
to
the
instrumenton
the
little
typewriter
desk
and
lifted
it
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
the
bell
had
started
to
ring
it
rang
six
times
then
a
man
s
voice
said
yeah
the
florence
aparments
yeah
the
high
window
i
d
like
to
speak
to
mr
anson
in
apartment
two
o
four
hold
the
wire
i
ll
see
if
he
s
in
mr
morningstar
and
i
held
the
wire
noise
came
over
it
the
blaring
sound
of
a
loud
radio
broadcasting
a
baseball
game
it
was
not
close
to
the
telephone
but
it
was
noisy
enough
then
i
could
hear
the
hollow
sound
of
steps
coming
nearer
and
the
harsh
rattle
of
the
telephone
receiver
being
picked
up
and
the
voice
said
not
in
any
message
i
ll
call
later
mr
morningstar
said
i
hung
up
fast
and
did
a
rapid
glide
across
the
floor
to
the
entrance
door
and
let
it
close
the
same
way
taking
its
weight
at
the
last
moment
so
that
the
click
of
the
catch
would
not
have
been
heard
three
feet
away
i
breathed
hard
and
tight
going
down
the
hall
listening
to
myself
i
pushed
the
elevator
button
then
i
got
out
the
card
which
mr
george
anson
phillips
had
given
me
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
metropole
i
did
nt
look
at
it
in
any
real
sense
i
did
nt
have
to
look
at
it
to
recall
that
it
referred
to
apartment
florence
apartments
court
street
i
just
stood
there
flicking
it
with
a
fingernail
while
the
old
elevator
came
heaving
up
in
the
shaft
straining
like
a
gravel
truck
on
a
hairpin
turn
the
time
was
three
fifty
bunker
hill
is
old
town
lost
town
shabby
town
crook
town
once
very
long
ago
it
was
the
choice
residential
district
of
the
city
and
there
are
still
standing
a
few
of
the
jigsaw
the
high
window
gothic
mansions
with
wide
porches
windows
with
spindle
turrets
they
are
all
rooming
houses
now
their
parquetry
floors
are
scratched
and
worn
through
the
once
glossy
finish
and
the
wide
sweeping
staircases
are
dark
with
time
and
with
cheap
varnish
laid
on
over
generations
of
dirt
in
the
tall
rooms
haggard
landladies
bicker
with
shifty
tenants
on
the
wide
cool
front
porches
reaching
their
cracked
shoes
into
the
sun
and
staring
at
nothing
sit
the
old
men
with
faces
like
lost
battles
in
and
around
the
old
houses
there
are
flyblown
restaurantsand
italian
fruitstands
and
cheap
apartment
houses
and
little
candy
stores
where
you
can
buy
even
nastier
things
than
their
candy
and
there
are
ratty
hotels
where
nobody
except
people
named
smith
and
jones
sign
the
register
and
where
the
night
clerk
is
half
watchdog
and
half
pander
out
of
the
apartment
houses
come
women
who
should
be
young
but
have
faces
like
stale
beer
men
with
pulled
down
hats
and
quick
eyes
that
look
the
street
over
behind
the
cupped
hand
that
shields
the
match
flame
worn
intellectuals
with
cigarette
coughs
and
no
and
unwavering
eyes
cokies
and
coke
peddlers
people
who
look
like
nothing
in
particular
and
know
it
waiting
it
struck
mary
as
queer
that
he
should
have
stayed
in
here
when
the
others
had
all
met
her
outside
she
ran
over
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
and
held
him
by
the
shoulders
laughing
and
saying
let
me
look
at
you
you
spalpeen
edgar
did
not
laugh
so
heartily
as
paul
he
gave
mary
a
hug
but
when
she
looked
eagerly
at
his
face
it
was
so
good
to
see
him
again
he
dropped
his
eyes
in
a
strange
way
and
turned
a
little
aside
mary
paused
troubled
and
a
little
hurt
was
edgar
not
glad
to
see
her
eddie
she
remembered
now
the
queer
reserve
he
had
shown
the
time
she
came
home
from
london
the
last
time
she
had
ever
really
talked
to
him
she
looked
at
paul
as
if
to
ask
silently
what
was
the
trouble
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
learned
from
the
remote
look
in
his
face
edgar
apparently
did
things
like
this
all
the
time
now
and
he
looked
so
strange
and
pale
and
nervous
mary
turned
hack
to
the
others
a
little
sadly
edgar
was
a
man
now
a
man
goodness
she
thought
of
twenty
five
you
could
not
treat
him
like
a
boy
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
the
slanting
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
in
clarissa
s
old
bay
window
garden
roused
the
ancient
memory
of
that
first
day
when
she
had
stood
trembling
before
her
new
employer
here
they
were
in
the
back
parlor
again
she
and
paul
and
edgar
and
in
some
unbelievableway
paul
s
wife
and
son
william
scott
should
be
here
and
his
distant
elder
son
mary
stood
and
looked
slowly
about
the
room
in
one
glance
she
was
renewing
her
profound
intimacy
with
it
and
also
observing
its
state
of
neglect
from
the
smudges
on
the
windows
to
the
worn
edges
of
the
upholstery
the
limp
sparse
leaves
of
the
dejected
plants
the
grimy
woodwork
the
filmy
unkept
look
of
the
fireplace
tiles
the
place
was
eloquent
of
everything
that
had
happened
to
the
family
now
the
troubled
present
swept
down
to
blot
the
memories
from
mary
s
mind
she
looked
about
and
saw
her
work
cut
out
louise
was
speaking
mother
scott
will
be
so
glad
to
see
you
mary
i
ll
go
right
up
her
own
words
echoed
in
mary
s
mind
as
she
ran
up
the
stairs
she
might
have
asked
to
go
to
clarissa
and
instead
she
had
pronounced
her
intention
of
doing
so
it
was
a
trifle
a
passing
unnoticed
exchange
of
words
but
mary
knew
approaching
clarissa
s
door
that
it
situation
was
to
mean
she
was
in
his
words
the
boss
she
would
not
ask
permissions
in
this
house
she
would
make
decisions
she
looked
at
paul
as
they
entered
his
mother
s
room
and
marvelled
that
fate
had
twisted
all
their
lives
into
this
tangle
clarissa
lay
in
bed
her
pain
racked
eyes
shining
with
happiness
at
sight
of
mary
she
stretched
out
her
bony
hand
and
drew
mary
close
for
an
eloquent
kiss
dear
child
she
said
slowly
mary
was
prepared
for
the
shock
of
the
changes
in
clarissa
and
did
not
show
by
a
flick
of
her
eye
the
sorrow
and
the
pity
that
throbbed
inside
her
clarissa
was
so
faded
she
had
never
been
a
woman
of
brilliant
coloring
or
striking
contours
but
now
her
blond
hair
had
turned
colorless
rather
than
gray
and
her
blue
eyes
had
lost
their
hue
she
had
a
ghostlike
quality
which
mary
had
never
seen
in
anyone
before
clarissa
scott
was
a
tall
woman
and
her
figure
in
years
past
could
see
the
flesh
was
rapidly
melt
ing
away
and
the
outline
of
her
body
beneath
the
bedclothes
was
bony
rather
than
full
and
rounded
as
it
used
to
be
her
voice
had
a
hesitant
almost
a
strangled
quality
as
if
she
feared
to
start
speaking
lest
a
paroxysm
of
pain
interrupt
her
and
silence
her
but
mary
did
not
show
a
sign
of
perceiving
all
this
she
drew
up
a
hassock
close
to
the
bed
and
perched
on
it
holding
clarissa
s
hand
and
talking
softly
and
happily
you
re
not
to
worry
about
a
thing
in
the
world
mrs
scott
she
said
we
ll
all
make
out
beautifully
here
together
louise
murmured
clarissa
her
heavy
eyes
followed
paul
as
he
tiptoedquietly
from
the
room
to
leave
his
mother
alone
with
mary
can
you
manage
all
that
of
course
they
looked
at
each
other
silently
then
mary
said
please
do
nt
worry
about
that
mrs
scott
i
m
him
to
marry
her
long
ago
do
nt
you
re
member
clarissa
nodded
i
would
nt
have
come
back
if
i
had
nt
felt
everything
had
turned
out
for
the
best
and
i
m
really
happy
truly
i
am
clarissa
pressed
mary
s
hand
you
re
a
dear
girl
i
m
so
awfully
glad
to
be
near
you
again
mary
stopped
speaking
as
a
change
began
to
come
over
clarissa
s
lethargic
features
the
bony
hand
in
hers
closed
suddenly
in
a
fierce
involuntary
clutch
the
dry
lips
set
in
a
grim
ghastly
line
the
leaden
eyes
sunken
deep
beneath
their
lids
a
moment
before
opened
violently
and
stared
with
horrible
eloquence
from
the
agonized
face
beads
of
dampness
sprang
out
on
the
putty
colored
forehead
mary
leaned
forward
mastering
her
impulse
to
cringe
at
this
fearful
sight
and
gripped
clarissa
s
hands
hard
looking
deep
into
her
eyes
even
in
the
throes
of
mortal
agony
clarissa
conveyed
her
relief
her
she
need
not
dissemble
mary
saw
all
in
a
moment
what
a
frightful
burden
of
self
imposed
discipline
this
strong
woman
had
added
to
the
torture
that
had
been
her
fate
mary
held
her
breath
and
did
not
move
while
the
paroxysmwas
violent
clarissa
sagged
suddenly
from
the
galvanic
stiffness
with
which
she
had
met
the
assault
her
eyes
indicated
a
vial
of
medicine
on
the
table
by
the
bed
two
she
gasped
through
her
nt
we
michael
yes
said
michael
he
was
shocked
and
surprised
victoria
remembered
hollis
at
the
telephone
the
way
he
sagged
against
the
wall
when
the
police
described
the
woman
they
had
found
in
the
river
yes
said
bessie
but
he
did
nt
tell
me
he
did
nt
want
to
alarm
me
and
we
we
d
had
words
about
the
girl
you
see
he
did
nt
she
swallowed
convulsively
he
did
nt
want
to
give
her
up
yet
he
was
nt
really
in
love
with
her
you
see
oh
mother
do
nt
said
hollis
he
turned
brusquely
away
walked
over
to
the
window
and
said
over
his
shoulder
tell
the
truth
it
was
murder
and
i
i
did
nt
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
i
it
was
an
impulse
and
i
looked
at
joan
there
in
that
beastly
little
room
and
i
i
could
nt
say
yes
i
knew
her
i
did
nt
even
tell
mother
until
after
joan
was
was
identified
i
could
nt
he
stopped
the
room
was
very
still
for
a
moment
then
he
know
it
and
a
coward
all
right
but
i
did
nt
kill
her
bessie
did
nt
move
only
her
great
ringed
eyes
followed
hollis
and
her
hands
twisted
victoria
started
toward
hollis
realized
that
sympathy
would
be
another
drop
of
humiliation
and
stopped
major
campbell
said
to
bessie
did
you
recognize
the
girl
her
great
eyes
flashed
no
certainly
not
did
you
ever
talk
to
her
over
the
telephone
i
mean
no
she
said
violently
a
woman
did
telephone
to
her
said
beasley
mrs
isham
why
did
you
want
your
son
to
stop
seeing
her
because
she
because
i
did
there
must
have
been
some
important
reason
did
she
know
anything
about
henry
frame
s
murder
hollis
turned
around
of
course
not
she
knew
nothing
of
it
how
could
she
bessie
said
heavily
i
did
nt
want
hollis
to
to
marry
victoria
there
s
the
business
you
see
hollis
could
manage
it
she
glanced
at
victoria
you
must
have
known
that
my
dear
she
said
breezily
never
really
wanted
you
to
marry
michael
she
glanced
at
michael
too
gave
him
a
queerly
polite
and
too
long
and
added
not
that
i
object
to
you
michael
i
just
did
nt
want
her
to
marry
anyone
but
hollis
michael
looking
a
little
amused
said
as
politely
as
bessie
i
quite
understand
but
aunt
bessie
began
victoria
and
stopped
with
a
feeling
of
helplessness
hollis
said
over
his
shoulder
victoria
does
nt
care
a
hang
for
me
mike
there
never
was
anything
between
us
it
s
just
an
idea
of
mother
s
beasley
said
his
voice
still
purring
but
mrs
isham
miss
steane
is
to
marry
bayne
she
would
have
been
married
to
him
now
quality
of
softness
except
for
the
fact
that
joan
green
and
miss
forbes
were
murdered
bessie
blinked
and
said
violently
i
did
nt
kill
either
of
them
to
stop
victoria
s
marriage
if
that
s
what
you
mean
major
campbell
came
forward
mrs
isham
had
joan
green
ever
come
to
the
house
before
he
asked
hollis
replied
no
never
yet
she
did
manage
to
find
her
way
from
the
corner
where
she
got
off
the
bus
through
the
grounds
to
the
pine
woods
hollis
shrugged
how
did
she
get
there
do
you
think
how
should
i
know
i
did
nt
meet
her
but
she
must
have
met
someone
do
you
know
who
certainly
not
said
hollis
unless
unless
what
well
said
hollis
there
s
this
maid
that
was
wandering
around
oh
you
re
going
to
make
the
most
of
her
are
nt
you
it
could
have
been
a
man
said
hollis
that
s
all
i
m
told
said
john
campbell
that
miss
green
was
very
good
at
her
job
did
you
think
so
isham
hollis
looked
at
him
suspiciously
why
i
do
nt
know
how
should
i
know
ask
the
officers
she
worked
for
she
did
have
a
very
retentive
memory
had
nt
she
i
do
nt
know
said
hollis
sulkily
did
she
ever
talk
of
colonel
galant
or
or
anything
at
all
to
do
with
affairs
in
the
office
hollis
whirled
around
his
face
was
red
again
and
his
light
eyes
were
snapping
listen
he
said
colonel
galant
called
me
into
his
office
late
this
afternoon
we
ve
had
all
this
out
did
nt
he
tell
you
or
i
see
question
me
too
well
listen
i
did
nt
sell
any
military
information
hollis
cried
his
mother
you
oh
be
still
mother
i
did
nt
sell
any
information
i
did
nt
know
anything
to
sell
and
i
would
nt
have
known
where
to
sell
it
if
i
had
known
anything
and
i
would
nt
have
done
it
anyway
so
that
s
that
there
was
a
long
silence
then
beasley
said
softly
well
let
s
just
go
over
all
this
again
an
hour
later
he
let
them
go
without
so
far
as
victoria
could
see
adding
a
scrap
to
his
stock
of
information
except
the
fact
that
bessie
had
told
clistie
about
joan
green
so
clistie
forbes
knew
the
girl
he
cried
in
triumph
certainly
not
said
bessie
she
d
never
seen
her
she
only
knew
of
her
her
name
and
where
she
worked
and
how
hollis
had
to
telephone
to
the
girl
you
told
her
to
get
the
girl
here
then
you
got
rid
of
both
of
them
beasley
s
method
of
questioning
was
almost
entirely
accusation
bessie
turned
purple
i
did
not
she
shouted
in
the
end
both
hollis
and
bessie
stuck
to
the
explanation
they
had
given
him
and
when
they
d
gone
he
turned
all
his
guns
upon
victoria
michael
would
have
stayed
but
beasley
made
him
leave
we
ll
come
to
you
again
later
he
said
with
a
little
smile
on
his
wide
purplish
lips
just
now
i
want
to
talk
to
miss
steane
so
michael
had
to
go
and
then
with
the
heavy
oak
door
closed
the
light
from
above
pouring
down
the
thick
go
and
then
elizabeth
would
offer
him
everything
she
had
she
was
too
loyal
and
she
loved
him
too
much
to
dream
of
doing
otherwise
she
would
work
and
use
everything
she
could
earn
for
his
support
she
would
spend
her
life
nursing
him
amusing
him
taking
care
of
him
himself
a
broken
wreck
of
a
creature
who
could
give
her
nothing
in
return
except
a
doglike
gratitude
her
splendid
vitality
would
be
spent
in
a
twilight
of
half
living
until
she
was
dry
and
withered
like
fruit
that
had
been
broken
off
the
tree
before
it
had
had
a
chance
to
ripen
as
he
thought
of
it
he
knew
more
and
more
surely
that
no
matter
what
would
become
of
him
he
could
not
let
this
happen
to
her
his
decision
was
not
entirely
unselfish
arthur
was
too
clearheaded
to
imagine
it
was
not
only
could
he
not
do
this
to
elizabeth
but
he
could
not
do
it
to
himself
to
share
it
he
knew
almost
as
if
he
were
with
her
what
she
would
suffer
at
being
told
of
his
death
but
that
would
not
last
forever
though
at
the
time
she
would
undoubtedly
think
it
was
going
to
she
would
pick
up
the
broken
pattern
of
her
life
and
set
about
putting
it
together
again
elizabeth
was
young
vital
alert
and
there
would
be
another
man
who
would
find
her
as
lovable
as
he
had
found
her
she
would
have
again
the
sort
of
mating
she
should
have
he
tried
instinctively
to
clench
his
list
with
decision
and
the
pain
that
went
like
a
bayonet
thrust
into
his
shoulder
reminding
him
that
he
was
not
even
able
to
make
such
a
simple
gesture
served
to
strengthen
his
resolve
when
a
man
dies
he
told
himself
with
more
fierceness
in
his
mind
since
there
could
be
none
in
his
body
it
is
like
taking
a
teaspoonful
of
water
out
of
a
river
the
water
closes
up
it
is
gone
when
jacoby
came
in
again
arthur
told
him
what
he
had
decided
to
do
he
had
to
speak
slowly
repeating
often
and
waiting
until
jacoby
s
intelligence
had
limped
through
to
comprehension
the
effort
to
make
jacoby
understand
took
his
attentionaway
from
the
bleak
import
of
what
he
was
saying
i
will
make
you
a
promise
jacoby
if
you
will
do
one
thing
for
me
do
it
and
come
back
and
tell
me
you
have
done
it
i
understand
you
go
ahead
when
i
was
brought
in
here
you
found
the
metal
tag
of
identification
and
other
things
maybe
take
those
to
the
international
red
cross
tell
them
your
stretcher
bearers
brought
in
an
american
who
died
of
his
wounds
you
do
not
know
his
name
but
you
took
these
objects
from
his
body
you
will
sign
a
death
certificate
or
whatever
you
have
to
sign
the
american
army
will
take
care
of
the
rest
if
you
will
do
this
and
bring
me
i
promise
you
that
i
will
let
you
do
whatever
you
please
to
me
but
if
you
will
not
do
it
i
swear
to
you
that
i
ll
make
you
do
it
because
i
ll
end
my
life
as
soon
as
i
have
a
usable
hand
to
do
it
with
deliberately
further
to
relieve
his
attention
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
jacoby
s
eyes
tender
as
the
eyes
of
a
mother
on
jacoby
strong
wise
gentle
face
and
while
he
repeated
his
sentence
she
noticed
again
what
a
thin
face
it
was
the
skin
showing
the
waxiness
of
malnutrition
and
guessed
as
he
had
guessed
before
that
this
man
was
denying
himself
part
of
his
own
rations
to
provide
more
nourishment
for
the
men
he
was
trying
to
save
at
last
he
said
slowly
and
carefully
you
understand
me
you
will
do
what
i
ask
jacoby
jacoby
nodded
while
he
sought
for
his
answer
his
right
hand
covered
the
right
hand
that
could
not
yet
be
clenched
friendly
across
the
wall
i
will
do
that
it
was
all
he
could
say
but
by
that
time
they
had
learned
to
do
a
good
deal
of
communicating
without
language
jacoby
did
not
have
a
wife
of
his
own
until
now
his
life
had
been
too
full
of
work
and
war
to
give
him
much
chance
to
think
of
personal
happiness
later
he
was
to
find
out
what
it
meant
to
have
a
woman
s
suffering
mean
more
to
him
than
his
own
but
he
did
not
hesitate
before
arthur
s
request
arthur
continued
you
will
not
communicate
with
my
wife
you
will
not
try
to
find
her
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
i
will
not
try
to
find
her
she
will
marry
again
arthur
said
another
man
will
love
her
she
will
have
children
she
will
be
happy
do
you
get
it
jacoby
she
s
a
splendid
woman
i
m
going
to
get
out
of
her
way
oh
you
do
nt
get
i
m
right
jacoby
tried
to
answer
you
are
he
hesitated
reaching
into
his
pocket
for
the
dictionary
he
always
carried
now
you
are
most
completely
right
kitt
he
looked
down
at
the
bundle
of
bandages
before
him
and
added
i
do
under
stand
you
arthur
s
voice
broke
in
a
sob
and
the
sob
came
from
so
deep
that
it
sent
points
of
pain
through
him
and
he
had
to
wait
till
they
subsided
before
he
could
go
on
you
do
nt
understand
you
never
loved
a
woman
again
the
sob
rushed
up
and
again
he
had
to
wait
till
the
pain
of
it
went
down
you
never
loved
a
woman
he
said
enough
to
die
for
her
whether
the
barrier
was
language
or
experience
this
time
jacoby
did
not
try
to
answer
but
he
went
and
did
what
arthur
had
asked
him
to
do
jacoby
used
one
of
the
precious
night
hours
up
a
sort
of
shelf
across
arthur
s
cot
and
set
the
dictionary
up
on
it
my
english
is
so
faulty
poor
family
there
is
too
many
children
on
this
earth
already
and
no
room
for
the
weak
ones
do
nt
say
that
katie
held
her
baby
tightly
it
s
not
better
to
die
who
wants
to
die
everything
struggles
to
live
look
at
that
tree
growing
up
there
out
of
that
grating
it
gets
no
sun
and
water
only
when
it
rains
it
s
growing
out
of
sour
earth
and
it
s
strong
because
its
hard
struggle
to
live
is
making
it
strong
my
children
will
be
strong
that
way
aw
somebody
ought
to
cut
that
tree
down
the
homely
thing
if
there
was
only
one
tree
like
that
in
the
world
you
would
think
it
was
beautiful
said
katie
but
because
there
are
so
many
you
just
ca
nt
see
how
beautiful
it
really
is
look
at
those
children
she
pointed
to
a
swarm
of
dirty
children
playing
in
the
gutter
you
could
dress
him
up
and
sit
him
in
a
fine
house
and
you
would
think
he
was
beautiful
you
ve
got
fine
ideas
but
a
very
sick
baby
katie
they
told
her
book
two
this
baby
will
live
said
katie
fiercely
i
ll
make
it
live
and
francie
lived
choking
and
whimpering
her
way
through
that
first
year
francie
s
brother
was
born
a
week
after
her
first
birthday
this
time
katie
was
not
working
when
the
pains
came
this
time
she
bit
her
lip
and
did
not
scream
out
in
her
agony
helpless
in
her
pain
she
was
capable
still
of
laying
the
foundation
for
bitterness
and
capability
when
the
strong
healthy
boy
howling
at
the
indignity
of
the
birth
process
was
put
to
her
breast
she
felt
a
wild
tenderness
for
him
the
other
baby
francie
in
the
crib
next
her
bed
began
to
whimper
katie
had
a
flash
of
contempt
for
the
weak
child
she
had
borne
a
year
son
she
was
quickly
ashamed
of
her
contempt
she
knew
it
was
nt
the
little
girl
s
fault
i
must
watch
myself
carefully
she
thought
i
am
going
to
love
this
boy
more
than
the
girl
but
i
must
nt
ever
let
her
know
it
is
wrong
to
love
one
child
more
than
the
other
but
this
is
something
that
i
can
not
help
sissy
begged
her
to
call
the
boy
after
johnny
but
katie
insisted
that
the
boy
had
a
right
to
a
name
all
his
own
sissy
got
very
angry
and
told
katie
a
thing
or
two
finally
katie
more
in
anger
than
in
truth
accused
sissy
of
being
in
love
with
johnny
sissy
answered
maybe
and
katie
shut
up
she
was
a
little
afraid
that
if
they
quarreled
further
she
would
find
out
that
it
was
so
about
sissy
loving
johnny
katie
called
the
boy
cornelius
after
a
noble
character
she
had
seen
a
handsome
actor
represent
on
the
stage
as
the
boy
grew
was
known
as
neeley
without
devious
reasoning
or
complicated
emotional
processes
the
boy
became
katie
s
whole
world
johnny
took
second
place
and
francie
went
to
the
back
of
her
mother
s
heart
katie
loved
the
boy
because
he
was
more
completely
hers
than
either
johnny
or
francie
neeley
looked
exactly
like
johnny
katie
would
make
him
into
the
kind
of
man
johnny
should
have
been
he
would
have
everything
that
was
good
about
johnny
she
would
encourage
that
she
would
stamp
out
all
of
the
things
that
were
bad
about
johnny
as
they
came
up
in
the
boy
neeley
he
would
grow
up
and
she
would
be
proud
of
him
and
he
would
take
care
of
her
all
of
her
days
he
was
the
one
that
she
had
to
see
through
francie
and
johnny
would
get
by
some
a
tree
grows
in
brooklynhow
but
she
would
take
no
chances
with
the
boy
she
d
see
to
it
that
he
more
than
got
by
gradually
as
the
children
grew
up
katie
lost
all
character
she
became
capable
hard
and
far
seeing
she
loved
johnny
dearly
but
all
the
old
wild
worship
faded
away
she
loved
her
little
girl
because
she
felt
sorry
for
her
it
was
pity
and
obligation
towards
her
that
she
felt
rather
than
love
johnny
and
francie
felt
the
growing
change
in
katie
as
the
boy
grew
stronger
and
handsomer
johnny
grew
in
weakness
and
went
further
and
further
down
hill
francie
felt
the
way
her
mother
thought
about
her
she
grew
an
answering
hardness
against
her
mother
and
this
hardness
paradoxically
enough
brought
them
a
little
closer
together
because
it
made
them
more
alike
by
the
time
neeley
was
a
year
old
katie
had
stopped
depending
on
johnny
johnny
was
drinking
heavily
he
worked
when
he
was
offered
one
night
jobs
he
brought
home
his
wages
but
kept
his
tips
for
liquor
life
was
going
too
swiftly
for
johnny
he
had
a
wife
and
two
babies
before
he
was
old
enough
to
vote
his
life
was
finished
before
it
had
a
chance
it
better
than
johnny
nolan
katie
had
the
same
hardships
as
johnny
and
she
was
nineteen
two
years
younger
it
might
be
said
that
she
too
was
doomed
her
life
too
was
over
before
it
began
but
there
the
similarity
ended
johnny
knew
he
was
doomed
and
accepted
it
katie
would
nt
accept
it
she
started
a
new
life
where
her
old
one
left
off
she
exchanged
her
tenderness
for
capability
she
gave
up
her
dreams
and
took
over
hard
realities
in
their
place
katie
had
a
fierce
desire
for
survival
which
made
her
a
fighter
johnny
had
a
hankering
after
immortality
which
made
him
a
useless
dreamer
and
that
was
the
great
difference
between
these
two
who
loved
each
other
so
well
johnny
celebrated
his
voting
birthday
by
getting
drunk
for
three
days
when
he
was
coming
out
of
it
katie
locked
him
in
the
bedroom
where
he
could
nt
get
anything
more
to
drink
instead
of
sobering
up
he
started
to
get
delirium
tremens
he
wept
and
was
suffering
she
compara
tively
safe
route
to
california
which
he
had
just
established
when
senatorbenton
presented
the
map
to
the
senate
he
delivered
a
eulogy
on
colonel
fremont
which
made
jessie
sitting
in
her
accustomed
seat
in
the
gallery
swell
with
pride
in
the
middle
of
february
some
twenty
one
months
after
john
had
left
washington
she
wrote
a
letter
to
her
cousin
sarah
brant
in
it
she
tried
to
explain
the
innumerable
devices
fill
ins
and
fortitudes
which
she
had
used
to
somehow
pass
the
time
explaining
also
the
sense
of
being
only
fractionally
alive
when
one
can
not
hear
the
voice
of
a
loved
one
touch
his
hand
sec
a
look
of
understanding
flash
into
his
eyes
she
ended
on
a
cheerful
note
which
looked
toward
the
future
i
feel
that
the
honor
to
colonel
fremont
is
but
honor
due
for
the
arduouslabors
he
has
performed
and
for
his
conspicuous
bravery
and
it
is
little
enough
reward
for
his
difficult
indeed
dear
cousin
for
me
to
express
my
own
happiness
its
warmth
and
light
have
driven
all
the
chill
and
dark
foreboding
from
my
heart
my
happiness
gives
me
renewed
strength
and
patience
exactly
a
week
later
when
she
was
working
at
her
desk
in
her
sitting
room
josheem
brought
in
a
page
from
the
state
department
with
a
packet
of
spanish
letters
if
you
will
return
at
five
this
afternoon
she
told
the
page
i
will
have
the
material
ready
for
you
she
was
skimming
a
long
letter
from
monterey
which
dealt
largely
with
land
grants
when
she
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
the
letter
told
of
a
quarrel
which
had
arisen
between
commodore
stockton
of
the
navy
and
general
kearny
of
the
army
over
the
command
and
control
of
california
the
letter
ended
with
a
sentence
which
the
writer
included
as
of
only
mild
interest
colonel
fremont
has
been
removed
as
commandant
of
california
she
waited
with
impatience
until
senator
benton
returned
at
four
o
clock
him
he
would
be
as
dumbfounded
as
she
had
been
instead
she
saw
her
father
flush
his
eyes
become
watery
in
a
terrifying
moment
she
thought
he
knows
about
this
then
it
must
be
worse
than
it
appears
in
this
dispatch
after
a
moment
he
said
i
heard
of
it
in
st
louis
when
i
was
there
last
month
why
did
nt
you
tell
me
i
had
hoped
the
trouble
would
blow
over
jessie
i
had
hoped
that
it
was
just
a
passing
quarrel
between
general
kearny
and
commodore
stockton
has
it
blown
over
no
she
began
pacing
the
room
nervously
but
what
could
possibly
have
happened
according
to
the
reports
john
was
doing
a
good
job
as
governor
why
did
they
suddenly
become
dissatisfied
it
was
not
a
question
of
his
performance
your
husband
got
himself
caught
in
a
contest
between
the
army
and
navy
for
authority
over
california
commodore
stockton
had
orders
to
take
and
when
the
mexicans
surrendered
commodore
stockton
appointed
colonel
fremont
as
the
governor
but
general
kearny
also
had
orders
from
washington
to
assume
the
governorship
of
california
should
he
conquer
and
take
possession
of
the
country
but
would
nt
commodore
stockton
s
orders
be
considered
the
valid
ones
since
the
fighting
was
practically
over
by
the
time
general
kearny
got
there
kearny
fought
one
battle
a
battle
which
he
lost
by
the
way
however
the
problem
revolves
about
the
question
of
who
had
the
latest
orders
from
washington
kearny
or
stockton
who
did
we
re
not
certain
yet
in
any
event
general
kearny
demanded
that
colonel
fremont
acknowledge
him
to
be
the
commander
in
chief
of
california
john
and
his
men
were
still
serving
under
stockton
as
part
of
the
navy
and
so
he
declined
to
acknowledge
kearny
s
authority
kearny
then
moved
his
headquarters
to
monterey
where
he
set
up
a
civil
government
and
declared
colonel
fremont
to
be
deposed
as
governor
with
no
further
authority
to
this
squabble
she
asked
with
a
heavy
heart
the
army
and
navy
belong
to
the
same
government
do
nt
they
once
again
her
father
s
manner
was
evasive
he
had
been
honest
with
his
daughter
for
so
many
years
that
he
found
the
transition
difficult
i
have
already
spoken
to
the
president
yes
he
wants
the
men
in
california
to
settle
this
dispute
among
them
selves
do
you
think
they
will
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
argument
that
ca
nt
be
settled
her
peace
shattered
jessie
impatiently
edged
through
the
weeks
that
followed
waiting
for
some
word
of
how
her
husband
was
faring
in
the
conflict
her
only
momentary
diversion
was
eliza
s
marriage
eliza
had
been
so
helpful
during
her
own
troubled
courtship
that
she
was
happy
to
be
able
to
stage
a
beautiful
wedding
for
her
older
sister
in
the
drawing
room
of
the
benton
home
eliza
wanted
the
affair
to
be
a
quiet
one
but
before
of
necessity
invite
some
two
hundred
people
the
dinner
which
followed
the
ceremony
was
elaborate
for
jessie
tried
to
duplicate
for
her
sister
the
magnificent
wedding
dinner
served
at
cherry
grove
the
preparations
the
excitement
the
visits
to
the
dressmaker
the
planning
of
the
ceremony
and
dinner
occupied
her
time
for
almost
three
weeks
she
was
glad
to
be
so
exhausted
by
the
end
of
the
day
that
she
could
fall
into
a
troubled
sleep
she
saw
her
sister
and
new
brother
in
law
off
for
a
trip
to
new
york
then
bade
good
by
to
her
father
who
was
going
to
st
louis
on
political
business
at
the
front
door
he
said
to
her
be
of
good
courage
and
take
care
of
your
health
i
ll
do
my
best
father
but
it
is
this
groping
in
the
dark
that
has
upset
me
if
only
i
could
know
what
is
going
on
out
there
thomas
benton
had
a
saying
that
good
news
travels
on
the
swiftest
horse
but
bad
news
before
the
almost
comfortable
silence
surrounding
the
events
in
california
was
split
open
her
cousin
sarah
if
they
do
stop
ut
of
fear
or
whatever
they
go
at
once
into
such
a
state
of
euphoria
and
well
being
that
they
become
over
confident
they
re
rid
of
drink
and
feel
sure
enough
of
themselves
to
be
able
to
start
again
promising
they
ll
take
one
or
at
the
most
two
and
well
then
it
becomes
the
same
old
story
all
over
do
nt
realize
it
because
liquor
does
nt
mean
to
us
what
it
does
to
them
the
doctor
turned
to
don
why
do
nt
you
go
home
you
can
you
know
i
m
waiting
for
my
hat
the
men
glanced
at
each
other
and
laughed
and
then
moved
off
he
could
have
kicked
himself
for
saying
that
it
made
him
somehow
so
utterly
ludicrous
and
laughable
that
he
was
ashamed
for
the
first
time
that
morning
oh
christ
what
difference
did
it
make
nobody
knew
he
was
here
and
nobody
here
knew
or
cared
who
he
was
but
he
was
ashamed
all
the
same
he
got
up
and
stepped
to
the
small
barred
window
near
the
end
of
his
bed
he
looked
out
and
down
cars
and
busses
were
going
by
people
moved
along
the
sidewalk
who
of
those
down
there
knew
who
was
up
here
what
was
going
on
in
this
room
what
was
going
on
inside
the
men
in
this
street
past
this
very
building
where
he
stood
looking
down
and
never
even
looked
at
the
place
never
dreamed
that
one
day
never
dreamed
it
because
those
things
just
did
nt
happen
not
to
the
kind
of
person
he
was
the
kind
of
people
he
knew
they
say
you
did
nt
have
a
hat
he
turned
and
there
was
bim
you
were
nt
wearing
one
when
you
came
in
they
say
i
was
nt
that
s
what
they
tell
me
baby
he
moved
away
from
the
wall
surprisingly
he
walked
well
enough
he
felt
weak
but
not
too
unsteady
the
paraldehyde
still
held
if
that
s
what
it
was
that
was
doing
it
it
had
to
hold
till
he
got
home
will
you
show
me
now
how
to
get
out
okay
let
me
take
your
arm
i
do
nt
need
it
thanks
they
started
down
the
ward
meet
the
derisive
yearning
or
fearful
glances
he
felt
from
all
sides
you
ve
got
to
stop
at
the
desk
and
sign
something
what
a
paper
you
release
the
hospital
from
all
responsibility
that
s
because
you
would
nt
take
the
treatment
in
the
hall
a
nurse
handed
up
a
printed
form
and
a
pen
without
looking
up
from
her
work
in
front
of
her
on
the
desk
was
a
large
open
jar
half
full
of
thick
white
wafers
probably
the
salt
tablets
they
had
been
talking
about
right
here
baby
bim
pointed
his
finger
at
the
place
t
o
sign
don
took
the
pen
his
mind
went
back
to
the
mornings
at
juan
les
pins
the
agonizing
mornings
at
the
bank
when
often
he
tent
more
than
an
hour
trying
to
control
the
shaking
of
his
hand
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
attempt
the
signature
on
the
letter
of
credit
under
the
eyes
of
the
watching
teller
he
would
drop
out
of
line
again
and
again
sit
outdoors
to
stare
at
the
incredible
blue
of
the
sea
and
take
deep
breaths
and
try
to
calm
himself
by
forgetting
the
money
he
needed
the
pen
the
necessary
signature
and
the
impassive
teller
and
when
he
had
recovered
enough
to
join
the
line
again
the
whole
unnerving
helpless
performance
would
he
repeated
but
now
to
his
surprise
probably
to
bim
s
too
the
hand
wrote
his
name
plainly
and
well
paraldehyde
he
must
hang
onto
it
never
never
forget
it
i
ll
take
you
to
the
elevator
baby
the
walk
through
the
hall
and
the
waiting
were
a
more
trying
ordeal
than
he
could
have
anticipated
they
went
along
the
corridor
in
silence
till
the
nurse
stopped
and
pushed
a
button
in
the
wall
then
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
looked
at
don
never
had
he
felt
so
much
on
trial
in
his
life
on
trial
for
what
he
did
nt
know
he
went
hot
with
exasperation
and
embarrassment
as
he
felt
the
nurse
s
eyes
looking
him
where
to
fix
his
own
gaze
he
waited
in
a
foolish
suspense
unreasonable
outlandish
bizarre
in
all
his
life
there
was
no
precedent
of
behavior
for
such
a
moment
i
f
that
guy
so
much
as
spoke
to
him
uttered
a
word
of
advice
told
him
to
take
it
easy
he
felt
the
odd
smile
and
fought
to
resist
but
it
was
no
use
he
could
nt
help
himself
any
longer
involuntarily
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
back
listen
baby
the
voice
was
so
low
and
soft
he
could
scarcely
hear
it
i
know
you
the
elevator
doors
slid
open
he
saw
the
brightly
lighted
car
and
the
sudden
response
on
the
faces
of
the
passengers
the
broken
blood
vessels
the
violent
discoloration
he
stepped
in
and
quickly
turned
his
back
through
the
small
glass
window
of
the
door
he
saw
the
nurse
s
eyebrows
raised
in
farewell
and
the
floor
gave
way
beneath
his
feet
as
he
came
out
into
ambulance
turned
in
at
the
gate
dang
dang
too
long
he
walked
on
to
a
bus
stop
at
the
corner
reached
into
his
vest
pocket
for
one
of
the
four
nickels
and
stepped
into
a
bus
he
went
to
the
far
end
of
the
bus
and
sat
down
on
the
rear
seat
but
he
might
just
as
well
have
stayed
up
front
the
passengers
turned
and
continually
turned
to
look
at
him
the
driver
bent
his
head
slightly
to
see
him
in
the
mirror
he
sa
back
erect
and
gazed
absently
out
of
the
window
trying
to
show
by
his
indifference
that
he
had
never
worn
a
hat
in
his
life
though
a
hat
at
this
moment
was
what
he
longed
for
more
than
almost
felt
used
up
he
stood
with
his
arm
around
rachel
and
he
listened
to
brother
peter
s
voice
that
voice
which
had
been
with
him
all
his
life
that
sure
confident
resonant
voice
jeff
had
picked
for
his
home
a
small
plot
of
land
near
the
schoolhouse
a
piece
that
was
owned
by
the
people
in
community
they
had
set
this
section
aside
for
a
school
and
a
cemetery
and
as
jeff
said
lightly
it
might
well
do
for
him
to
be
near
both
gideon
arranged
for
the
building
they
were
old
hands
at
it
by
now
the
timber
was
their
own
two
by
fours
sweet
smelling
pine
siding
three
quarter
inch
plank
for
the
flooring
dovetail
oak
to
do
the
inside
properly
all
of
hannibal
washington
a
fine
bricklayer
set
in
the
hearths
and
chimneys
jeff
spent
hours
drawing
plans
a
sunlit
examination
room
a
space
for
two
beds
a
large
section
that
would
someday
be
an
operating
room
he
said
to
gideon
finally
it
comes
out
the
largest
house
at
carwell
which
is
fitting
gideon
agreed
where
will
the
money
come
from
i
have
enough
money
for
that
i
think
gideon
smiled
i
ca
nt
take
any
more
from
you
i
ve
been
taking
all
these
years
i
would
nt
worry
about
it
jeff
you
ll
want
equipment
wo
nt
you
furniture
beds
other
things
they
cost
a
lot
we
ll
manage
i
suppose
you
could
find
some
of
it
in
columbia
but
i
think
we
d
do
better
in
charleston
we
ll
go
there
soon
he
had
other
reasons
for
wanting
to
go
to
charleston
but
them
he
and
jeff
could
go
together
for
the
time
being
jeff
and
ellen
lived
with
gideon
there
was
a
deep
trust
and
close
communion
between
ellen
and
rachel
something
gideon
did
not
share
once
jeff
said
to
his
father
do
you
hold
it
against
me
my
marrying
ellen
a
man
should
marry
the
woman
he
loves
gideon
replied
and
he
tried
to
tell
that
to
himself
to
make
himself
believe
that
along
with
many
other
things
as
he
realized
later
much
of
the
world
he
lived
in
that
march
of
was
a
fool
s
world
for
gideon
jackson
to
believe
that
the
sun
stood
still
and
that
time
stood
still
was
strange
stranger
even
than
that
was
the
fact
that
he
had
so
much
real
happiness
in
those
few
weeks
happiness
married
by
many
small
things
but
real
happiness
for
the
first
time
in
almost
a
decade
gideon
laid
aside
his
books
he
did
nt
want
to
read
to
study
to
the
increasing
number
of
patients
he
spent
the
whole
of
every
day
working
with
marcus
for
people
so
far
apart
so
different
in
basic
matters
he
and
marcus
understood
each
other
well
marcus
lacked
the
driving
pain
that
was
a
part
of
gideon
and
jeff
for
them
there
was
the
whole
of
the
puzzling
world
for
marcus
the
world
was
constrained
and
understandable
and
in
a
sense
more
complete
marcus
was
a
sinner
brother
peter
admitted
that
sadly
yet
comprehendingly
marcus
loved
the
fact
of
women
body
breast
and
thigh
without
shame
yet
without
lust
and
animal
health
and
freedom
filled
him
like
a
cup
brimming
over
with
life
liquid
small
and
slim
as
he
was
he
could
outwork
gideon
he
drank
with
the
white
men
the
way
they
drank
matching
leslie
carson
s
son
joe
drink
for
drink
down
a
half
gallon
jug
of
raw
corn
he
loved
to
dance
his
accordion
made
the
old
music
new
all
the
old
swamp
songs
the
tired
his
fingers
they
became
something
new
he
gave
them
new
rhythms
new
life
he
worshipped
gideon
he
knew
cotton
but
gideon
knew
it
better
he
knew
the
soil
and
bowed
to
gideon
there
they
worked
at
the
forge
in
the
barn
and
put
a
new
tire
on
a
cartwheel
stripped
to
the
waist
gideon
drove
his
hammer
like
a
smith
forty
five
years
had
nt
taken
the
strength
out
of
his
arms
and
as
the
hammer
came
down
again
and
again
it
filled
the
world
with
its
sound
mark
it
the
boy
sang
turning
the
iron
mark
it
mark
it
mark
it
and
gideon
piled
on
sweat
streaming
down
his
face
they
shifted
all
the
remaining
fodder
into
a
new
bin
working
together
in
smooth
rhythm
with
their
forks
singing
together
i
got
a
crick
in
my
back
i
m
old
and
tired
they
cleared
swamp
growth
for
planting
swinging
two
edged
axes
in
short
stinging
blows
and
came
tramping
but
delighted
with
themselves
jeff
told
gideon
at
your
age
that
is
nt
the
wisest
thing
at
my
age
gideon
smiled
it
s
not
as
if
you
did
it
all
the
time
when
you
live
a
sedentary
life
most
of
the
year
gideon
and
marcus
took
a
day
off
hunting
gideon
with
a
rifle
in
hope
of
raising
a
deer
marcus
with
a
shotgun
saying
he
would
be
satisfied
with
rabbits
they
whistled
their
two
speckled
pointers
filled
their
pockets
with
bread
and
set
off
across
the
fields
one
cold
crisp
morning
they
sang
their
own
song
softly
and
happily
daddy
went
a
hunting
lord
lord
lord
yes
daddy
went
a
hunting
lord
lord
lord
the
dogs
fanned
out
and
cut
back
and
forth
across
the
meadows
the
two
men
did
nt
talk
much
somehow
it
never
mattered
that
gideon
and
marcus
had
so
little
to
say
to
each
other
they
fitted
not
hide
nor
hair
of
a
deer
had
gideon
seen
but
marcus
s
pouch
held
a
brace
of
fat
rabbits
he
took
them
to
the
barn
to
skin
and
dress
them
and
give
the
dogs
their
reward
of
the
gizzards
gideon
went
to
the
house
jeff
was
waiting
for
him
his
face
like
a
piece
of
granite
his
eyes
hard
the
way
gideon
had
never
seen
them
before
he
led
his
father
into
the
parlor
abner
lait
sat
there
his
big
red
hands
tight
on
his
knees
what
is
it
gideon
wanted
of
the
first
war
party
but
south
boy
knew
that
mojave
ritual
was
so
bound
down
to
the
tradition
of
the
first
times
that
the
actual
procedure
of
yellow
road
s
party
would
nt
have
varied
greatly
from
that
set
down
in
the
flying
overhead
that
heralded
the
party
s
return
how
the
people
shouted
when
they
saw
it
how
they
sent
four
alyah
men
who
dressed
and
behaved
like
women
to
meet
the
warriors
and
aid
the
unclean
trophy
bearer
on
whose
pole
the
long
hair
of
the
head
skins
waved
and
danced
in
the
summer
wind
how
a
hota
came
forth
and
invited
all
the
warriors
to
a
dance
and
a
feast
and
how
he
likewise
offered
a
small
house
and
a
patch
of
garden
to
the
captive
slaves
these
girls
lived
a
strange
life
thereafter
technically
they
were
the
slaves
of
the
host
who
took
charge
of
them
but
he
never
made
them
work
nor
did
he
go
near
them
or
have
anything
to
do
with
them
except
to
see
that
they
did
nt
run
away
they
were
treated
much
like
animals
in
a

mojaves
came
from
long
distances
to
watch
these
foreign
women
often
tossing
them
bundles
of
food
if
they
got
tired
of
being
on
exhibition
they
could
ask
the
hota
to
take
them
to
the
river
and
not
tried
to
run
away
for
a
long
time
he
would
do
it
then
they
would
be
considered
mojaves
and
could
live
with
any
man
who
wanted
them
but
even
then
they
usually
died
virgins
because
all
the
men
were
afraid
of
them
pin
the
nichiva
singing
there
were
many
verses
about
the
status
of
slave
girls
then
it
described
the
pole
with
the
head
skins
standing
in
the
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
dancing
place
i
low
the
men
and
women
danced
around
it
their
faces
painted
black
and
yellow
their
hair
stiff
with
white
clay
and
alkali
dancing
in
many
groups
each
in
a
different
manner
according
to
which
cycle
of
dream
singing
its
leader
sang
some
clapped
hands
some
shook
rattles
some
danced
to
drumbeats
made
on
a
basket
or
a
water
jar
all
this
was
in
the
nichiva
singing
nr
great
detail
when
the
old
indian
stopped
he
was
very
tired
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
get
his
breath
when
he
did
he
said
there
now
i
am
weak
because
i
have
not
eaten
for
a
long
time
i
need
big
meat
and
there
is
hume
here
i
t
occurred
to
south
boy
that
the
old
man
might
actually
be
starving
still
grumbling
about
big
meat
yellow
road
drank
some
f
the
water
and
chewed
a
little
of
the
bean
fiber
with
his
few
limit
teeth
and
spat
it
out
with
a
grimace
then
he
began
the
story
of
the
first
defeat
the
mojaves
suffered
in
tribal
history
gain
a
yuma
traveler
had
been
murdered
and
again
the
tilers
had
been
a
kindred
tribe
this
time
the
maricopa
over
the
salt
river
valley
with
the
maricopa
lived
the
remnant
f
the
colorado
river
tribes
that
the
mojave
and
the
yuma
d
ruined
in
war
and
driven
east
across
the
desert
some
of
c
e
had
killed
the
lone
yuma
the
yuma
always
a
small
tribe
sent
eighty
two
clubbers
t
a
punitive
expedition
the
mojave
sent
two
hundred
and
they
were
joined
by
a
hundred
yavapai
and
i
he
maricopa
knew
they
were
coming
and
called
on
their
friends
the
pima
who
were
club
fighters
like
the
mojave
and
very
numerous
people
they
sent
the
maricopa
four
hundred
men
who
fought
in
solid
phalanx
behind
big
bullhide
shields
the
apache
horsemen
charged
first
and
fought
like
lions
for
about
five
minutes
having
several
horses
killed
and
many
men
wounded
but
when
they
found
the
pima
maricopa
line
would
not
break
they
fled
the
yavapai
charged
with
the
apache
being
half
mojave
and
half
apache
they
fought
for
a
longer
time
and
lost
ten
men
before
they
ran
the
mojave
and
the
yuma
being
on
foot
struck
next
they
broke
the
line
of
pima
shields
again
and
again
killing
a
hundred
men
but
the
pima
always
re
formed
no
other
alien
people
had
ever
done
that
before
in
the
history
of
mojave
warfare
then
said
yellow
road
i
called
to
the
yuma
i
said
they
are
too
many
and
we
are
too
far
from
our
own
two
they
had
thrust
themselves
into
the
midst
of
the
pima
and
killed
until
they
died
nobody
else
fought
like
that
but
our
people
and
the
pima
the
mojave
lost
forty
men
killed
and
there
was
not
a
man
among
them
but
carried
some
wound
the
defeated
mojave
retreated
for
eight
days
through
yavapai
country
and
through
the
land
of
the
walapai
the
walapai
stood
on
their
hills
and
jeered
at
them
and
the
mojaves
too
wounded
and
weary
to
punish
them
went
home
to
sulk
and
brood
this
was
in
the
spring
of
out
of
this
jeering
a
greater
evil
was
to
befall
in
august
of
that
year
a
large
immigrant
train
the
first
contingent
of
iowans
to
migrate
to
southern
california
came
down
lieutenant
beale
s
new
trail
through
north
central
arizona
and
when
they
were
camped
at
the
river
crossing
where
fort
mojave
now
stands
the
walapai
came
and
again
taunted
the
mojave
and
dared
them
to
attack
the
whites
and
the
mojaves
still
brooding
over
their
defeat
hundred
head
of
cattle
driving
the
emigrantsback
the
way
they
had
come
and
no
others
ever
came
down
that
trail
thus
the
mojaves
gained
back
their
prestige
for
a
little
while
then
the
soldiers
came
the
first
hostile
invasion
of
the
mojave
valley
yellow
road
said
nothing
of
how
the
rifle
fire
of
the
soldiers
mowed
down
the
ranks
of
the
mojave
clubbers
he
ended
his
story
cursing
the
walapai
naming
their
dead
grandfathers
he
closed
his
eyes
he
said
i
am
weak
my
shadow
is
weak
i
need
meat
by
and
by
before
atlanta
or
at
peach
tree
creek
a
young
aide
of
sherman
s
rushed
up
to
the
general
saluted
and
said
general
sherman
sir
two
journalists
have
been
killed
in
the
action
on
our
left
clint
who
was
standing
near
knew
how
the
have
news
from
hell
before
breakfast
eh
general
sherman
laughed
clint
told
the
story
that
night
in
sherman
s
presence
to
sherman
s
staff
putting
the
remark
in
the
general
s
mouth
after
that
it
got
down
to
the
privates
and
sherman
heard
news
from
hell
before
breakfast
so
much
that
he
came
to
believe
that
he
had
said
it
but
what
was
more
important
that
remark
got
clint
into
the
general
s
dispatches
it
no
doubt
got
clint
the
call
to
speak
to
the
new
england
society
and
to
the
reunion
of
the
army
of
tennessee
after
the
war
where
the
idea
of
clint
this
old
friend
who
had
sent
him
a
box
of
havanas
as
a
cabinet
member
must
have
entered
the
back
of
grant
s
head
but
wagnal
said
i
do
nt
believe
i
saw
much
of
clint
in
georgia
i
spent
most
of
my
free
time
up
to
the
battle
of
atlanta
with
rome
and
if
i
ever
saw
a
man
gaunt
down
and
sadden
it
boy
that
this
was
his
second
war
and
that
he
had
had
a
youth
of
strife
and
hardship
and
i
think
that
his
family
back
in
iowa
had
been
forced
to
open
a
dressmaker
s
shop
to
help
pay
the
taxes
and
keep
themselves
though
he
sent
them
nearly
all
his
captain
s
pay
when
he
got
it
i
believe
that
one
worsham
jones
whom
he
had
left
in
charge
of
his
livery
stable
was
stealing
the
receipts
and
running
mrs
hanks
into
debt
besides
these
anxieties
he
had
one
of
the
worst
cases
of
dysentery
i
ever
treated
and
the
general
tone
of
his
health
was
low
so
i
saw
him
sadden
on
the
march
through
georgia
oh
he
did
nt
give
up
do
nt
ever
believe
sir
that
it
was
in
rome
to
give
up
but
the
sadness
grew
deeper
in
him
one
day
he
said
to
me
at
peach
tree
creek
i
think
thomas
the
boy
without
the
teeth
came
to
me
today
and
told
me
clint
the
boy
thought
it
was
only
one
shot
he
said
it
looked
as
if
the
muzzle
was
pointed
his
way
and
he
sure
heard
the
bullet
whine
do
you
think
clint
is
doing
these
things
can
it
be
that
bates
and
that
lad
are
touched
well
rome
i
said
what
do
you
think
of
it
you
pulled
clint
and
bates
out
of
the
mud
at
pittsburgh
landing
and
toothless
too
yes
rome
said
but
that
might
happen
to
anybody
the
battle
of
atlanta
gave
clint
belton
a
fine
total
on
the
profit
side
of
his
ledger
his
courage
was
high
he
must
have
felt
the
luck
in
him
that
day
i
am
riding
the
crest
he
said
to
himself
you
know
how
that
is
in
a
game
of
ball
or
cricket
or
tennis
there
are
days
when
you
are
in
fine
form
and
fettle
when
you
wallop
the
ball
you
feel
the
good
impact
and
you
know
as
you
swing
and
hit
that
this
is
a
good
shot
made
him
hump
to
no
avail
not
that
it
was
such
a
victory
for
the
union
it
was
a
bad
fight
for
us
a
terrible
fight
but
for
clint
it
was
a
personal
victory
we
were
on
the
left
behind
some
light
works
we
had
thrown
up
the
night
before
they
opened
with
cannon
about
noon
and
pretty
soon
they
were
around
behind
us
yelling
that
high
rebel
screech
and
coming
on
like
a
bat
out
of
hell
oh
well
wagnal
said
it
seemed
so
perhaps
they
did
nt
really
for
they
were
nearly
all
tired
and
hungry
and
a
good
many
of
them
were
boys
and
old
men
why
i
collared
a
boy
who
had
his
ma
s
butcher
knife
lashed
to
the
end
of
a
broom
handle
he
tried
to
stick
it
in
me
but
it
hit
my
belt
buckle
and
besides
it
was
dull
as
butter
and
he
was
too
weak
he
cried
with
rage
when
i
took
the
broomstick
away
from
him
and
made
him
go
behind
our
lines
he
ma
with
a
shell
i
ought
to
have
been
with
the
wounded
all
the
time
but
i
itched
then
to
get
out
in
front
and
get
myself
shot
that
was
how
i
happened
to
see
clint
on
foot
running
up
and
down
the
lines
behind
the
works
hollering
for
everybody
to
hold
hard
and
give
em
hell
he
had
his
colt
s
revolver
in
one
hand
and
his
sword
in
the
other
and
we
ll
give
the
devil
his
due
he
had
the
eye
of
mars
and
the
beard
of
zeus
that
day
all
right
he
had
on
his
buck
gauntlets
and
he
was
as
dusty
and
dirty
as
all
the
actors
who
played
the
part
of
the
dusty
courier
in
all
the
melodramas
about
the
war
between
the
states
in
little
tank
towns
for
years
afterward
once
or
twice
i
saw
him
wave
his
sword
and
take
a
shot
at
the
rebels
over
our
heads
sleepy
bates
and
the
toothless
boy
were
near
me
and
i
saw
sleepy
turn
his
head
to
look
over
his
shoulder
with
was
shouting
and
firing
his
pistol
i
could
see
it
kick
in
his
hand
rome
was
standing
beside
toothless
taking
aim
with
a
musket
he
had
picked
up
when
toothless
started
beating
him
on
the
shoulder
and
pointing
first
to
bates
who
was
lying
belly
down
with
his
face
in
the
redclay
parapet
of
the
works
and
then
to
clint
who
was
firing
over
our
heads
again
i
saw
rome
frown
vexedly
try
to
hear
what
toothless
had
to
say
and
turn
away
to
aim
the
musket
again
i
saw
a
red
spot
come
up
on
bates
eyes
half
closed
he
felt
a
sudden
violent
excitement
tingle
his
scalp
bring
him
in
in
here
in
here
she
went
out
abruptly
the
flap
of
her
loose
shoes
sounding
down
the
corridor
savanna
laid
her
sewing
in
her
lap
the
gleam
in
her
eyes
asked
a
question
simon
wiped
his
hot
hands
on
his
handkerchief
and
answered
as
if
she
had
spoken
aloud
maybe
maybe
he
went
to
the
room
he
stood
briefly
looking
out
through
a
closed
shutter
his
face
and
mouth
and
brow
wiped
suddenly
clean
of
expression
only
his
mind
piercing
the
opacity
to
the
dark
night
he
looked
back
at
her
swiftly
savanna
excitement
stifled
his
voice
i
le
heard
the
flap
of
soft
shoes
coming
once
more
down
the
corridor
and
watched
prudence
come
through
the
door
gaunt
and
tall
they
did
not
see
her
friend
for
a
moment
for
she
was
taller
than
he
then
she
stepped
back
and
said
this
is
him
he
was
dark
brown
and
middle
aged
his
hair
was
grizzled
his
body
strong
and
disproportionate
in
bulk
the
back
twisted
into
a
slight
hump
the
strong
upper
torso
overbalancing
the
short
legs
simon
looked
into
his
face
as
he
held
out
his
hand
the
face
was
a
power
withdrawn
behind
his
bright
eyes
something
waited
and
watched
my
wife
simon
said
briefly
and
then
he
said
thompson
sat
down
slowly
a
torn
straw
hat
covering
his
shabby
knees
simon
was
aware
of
a
faint
smile
behind
his
lips
and
a
quick
up
and
down
of
himself
and
savanna
the
voice
when
he
spoke
was
soft
and
disarming
i
m
in
a
heap
of
trouble
mas
r
prue
done
think
mebbe
you
cud
tell
me
how
t
make

simon
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
then
he
said
what
s
the
trouble

ai

s
what
i

he
smiled
and
shifted
the
straw
hat
around
on
his
knees
but
poor
niggers
do
nt
have
a
call
to
know
nothin
they
got
to
learn
from
white
genmun
things
like
stoppin
the
law
chair
tilted
back
the
hands
in
his
pockets
were
waiting

tone
of
his
voice

waiting
there
was
a
waiting
vigilance
in
his
eyes

giving

the

narrow

simon
and
his
chair
swayed
ever
so
slightly
a
black
man
he
said
thoughtfully
has
plenty
of
shove
he
waited
watching
those
black
eyes
had
never
been
merry
he
decided
the
sambo
smile
was
a
trick
ile
felt
a
coldness
mount
up
in
him
not
the
coldness
of
apprehension
but
the
coldness
which
comes
when
the
familiaris
suddenly
revealed
as
the
unknown
he
waited
in
the
presence
of
the
strange
and
unknown
he
waited
for
the

slight
soft

across
at
savanna
whose
needle
moved
perfunctorily

the
merry
eyes
shot
upward
from
the
frayed
hat

simon
tipped
his
chair
back
so
that
a
shadow
fell
across
his
face

jake
thompson
s
head
was
lowered
his
soft
voice
was
stilled
n
the
slow
scratching
of
his
thumb
against
the
straw
brim
of
his
hat
presently
he

to
shrewd
ness

mite
never
preach
nothin
but
what
white
folks
d
like

hear
and
you
ca
nt
help
it
if
tom

harry
get
ideas
like
cai
nt
help
nothin
that
happens
after
the
preachin
is
done
i
will
break
everybond
and
let
hardships
and
the
dangers
he
and
ellen
endured
together
for
of
course
it
really
was
dangerous
he
explained
things
might
have
gone
badly
wrong
and
he
concluded
something
happened
to
me
on
the
way
down
the
canyon
i
had
liked
ellen
before
that
and
yet
i
had
felt
a
certain
antagonism
toward
her
too
for
no
reason
except
that
i
was
at
leave
her
to
heaven
i
leave
her
to
heaven
i
was
a
confirmed
old
bachelor
and
bachelors
always
shy
off
from
any
sort
of
matrimonial
pitfall
but
before
we
came
to
the
end
of
our
journey
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
and
i
were
in
all
the
ways
that
mattered
already
married
and
that
she
was
the
bravest
and
finest
and
altogether
the
most
desirable
woman
in
the
world
the
same
way
about
me
maybe
it
s
a
conceited
thing
to
say
danny
but
i
think
she
s
quite
as
much
in
love
with
me
as
i
am
with
her
for
instance
my
idea
would
have
been
to
wait
till
you
could
be
at
our
wed
ding
but
she
does
nt
want
to
wait
to
wait
would
mean
her
going
back
to
boston
and
my
going
back
to
you
and
our
not
seeing
each
other
for
weeks
or
months
but
she
s
anxious
to
come
with
me
and
to
know
you
and
i
m
anxious
for
you
to
know
her
and
neither
of
us
wanted
to
wait
we
ll
be
married
here
tomorrow
morning
and
glen
robie
is
lending
us
a
car
and
we
ll
drive
away
somewhere
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
start
to
come
to
you
be
ready
with
a
big
welcome
for
us
danny
i
want
you
to
be
as
happy
as
i
am
it
will
be
three
of
us
instead
of
only
two
from
fine
we
both
send
love
and
well
see
you
soon
dick
danny
read
that
letter
slowly
devouring
every
word
and
he
grinned
at
dick
s
happiness
and
he
thought
dick
sounded
different
already
younger
gay
and
merry
and
more
like
a
boy
than
a
man
there
were
two
or
three
passages
which
to
his
sharpened
and
sensitive
mind
seemed
a
little
as
though
dick
were
trying
to
reassure
himself
but
danny
decided
that
was
just
his
imagination
certainly
dick
would
not
have
married
anyone
unless
he
wanted
to
very
much
indeed
so
ellen
was
bound
to
be
all
right
he
told
the
nurses
and
the
doctors
joyfully
the
news
lis
ten
is
nt
this
wonderful
dick
s
married
to
a
girl
out
there
they
re
coming
right
on
here
he
even
read
them
parts
of
dick
s
letter
telling
who
she
was
and
what
she
was
like
telling
the
story
of
the
adventure
in
the
canyon
but
he
saw
their
ex
change
what
they
were
thinking
because
of
course
they
knew
how
much
dick
meant
to
him
so
to
make
them
see
that
he
did
not
feel
badly
he
put
on
an
excessive
enthusiasm
insisting
over
and
over
on
his
delight
but
when
he
was
left
alone
his
eyes
shadowed
with
doubts
would
dick
love
him
as
much
as
ever
come
to
see
him
as
often
stay
as
long
would
she
like
him
or
would
she
resent
dick
s
devotion
to
him
after
all
you
could
nt
blame
her
for
not
wanting
dick
tied
down
forced
to
stay
near
a
sick
crippled
bedridden
boy
who
could
nt
do
anything
who
could
never
do
anything
again
except
perhaps
lurch
around
on
crutches
and
sit
in
a
wheel
chair
and
of
course
swim
it
was
only
his
legs
that
were
useless
and
when
he
was
a
little
stronger
lie
would
be
able
to
swim
with
his
arms
and
they
said
he
could
even
use
his
legs
in
swimming
too
but
all
and
dick
said
she
was
pretty
and
probably
she
liked
good
times
parties
and
dances
and
fishing
trips
and
travelling
and
naturally
she
would
nt
ever
love
him
as
dick
did
maybe
dick
would
leave
him
here
among
strangers
who
were
as
nice
as
they
could
be
of
course
and
take
her
home
to
boston
take
her
next
summer
to
back
of
the
moon
take
her
fishing
at
anticosti
take
her
with
him
to
all
the
places
to
which
he
and
danny
had
planned
to
go
that
would
be
pretty
terrible
but
he
must
nt
let
them
know
he
minded
just
because
he
was
crippled
that
did
nt
mean
he
had
any
right
to
boss
their
two
lives
he
would
send
them
away
to
have
their
good
times
together
just
as
he
had
sent
dick
away
this
summer
only
perhaps
when
he
was
stronger
he
could
sometimes
go
with
them
and
not
be
too
much
of
a
bother
he
would
be
able
to
walk
on
crutches
by
then
and
perhaps
after
you
did
nt
have
to
be
able
to
walk
to
write
books
during
the
next
two
or
three
days
danny
convinced
himself
that
he
could
avoid
hindering
their
happiness
no
one
wanted
an
invalid
hung
around
his
neck
all
the
time
and
he
certainly
did
nt
want
to
be
a
burden
to
them
they
would
be
happy
and
so
would
he
leave
her
to
heaven
one
evening
a
telegram
announced
they
would
arrive
next
day
as
long
as
the
hour
of
their
coming
had
been
uncertain
danny
had
been
able
to
think
pretty
clearly
and
to
plan
how
gladly
he
would
greet
them
so
that
not
even
dick
should
guess
the
terror
he
had
felt
but
now
in
the
imminence
of
their
arrival
he
was
just
plain
scared
again
if
she
were
the
sort
of
girl
some
men
thought
beautiful
all
made
up
with
red
fingernails
and
a
red
mouth
it
would
be
pretty
awful
during
the
daylight
hours
before
they
came
he
lay
still
trembling
terribly
perspiring
cold
with
lonely
heard
dick
s
voice
along
the
corridor
heard
them
coming
nearer
and
nearer
his
door
he
shut
his
eyes
tight
dreadfully
afraid
that
he
was
going
though
it
was
nt
my
party
garback
mused
ellery
was
nt
there
a

the

struck

then
ellery
remembered
the
look
on
davy
fox
s
face
in
the
queen
living
room
in
new
york
oh
yes
well
mr
hendrix
it
may
be
necessary
for
me
to
talk
to
tom
garback
where
can
i
find
him
ask
the
white
house
grinned
prosecutor
hendrix
tom
was
called
to
washington
years
ago
confidential
work
on
pennsylvania
avenue
last
i
heard
he
was
off
somewhere
on
a
mission
for
the
president
he
might
be
in
paris
or
moscow
or
where
have
you
local
boy
makes
good
you
sound
bitter
grinned
ellery
in
that
case
mr
hendrix
official
records
of
the
fox
trial
available
to
me
eh
the
prosecutor
threw
up
his
hands
four
days
later
ellery
dropped
into
chief
of
police
dakin
s
office
i
was
wonderin
what
happened
to
you
said
the
chief
boned
up
have
you
i
ve
been
studying
the
old
court
records
nose
out
anything
if
you
mean
errors
t
no
chief
dakin
sighed
i
told
you
mr
queen
it
was
an
open
and
shut
case
oh
certainly
ellery
stared
out
the
thief
s
window
at
the
wrightsville
light
power
company
and
the
northern
state
telephone
company
buildings
across
state
street
the
serene
old
elms
he
remembered
intervened
but
they
were
agitated
this
morning
it
was
a
sunless
blustery
day
but
then
i
did
nt
expect
to
find
anything
startling
i
ve
assumed
all
along
that
if
there
s
anything
to
be
found
it
will
take
more
than
library
work
very
well
i
must
say
considering
that
detective
howie
s
taken
his
orders
literally
and
insists
on
occupying
the
same
bed
emily
fox
has
given
them
the
south
room
on
the
first
floor
tough
on
bayard
said
dakin
he
s
up
to
it
not
so
shy
he
s
loosened
up
considerably
though
there
s
a
good
deal
of
strain
between
him
and
his
brother
talbot
i
wonder
if
there
s
anything
behind
that
was
there
ever
not
that
i
know
of
they
always
got
along
in
business
fine
so
i
understand
anyway
bayard
sits
around
all
day
talking
over
old
times
with
davy
when
davy
s
around
which
is
nt
often
it
s
not
easy
for
davy
or
getting
acquainted
with
linda
to
whom
he
s
taken
a
shine
and
filling
out
on
emily
s
fruit
pies
that
woman
bakes
a
fillip
pie
the
chief
grunted
so
now
what
mr
queen
typewritten
list
of
names
dakin
scanned
the
list
slowly
you
want
these
people
yes
when
on
call
from
now
on
they
re
still
in
town
yep
even
young
jackson
the
negro
boy
that
s
more
than
i
could
have
hoped
for
why
do
you
say
even
young
jackson
abe
l
s
in
the
army
he
s
henry
clay
jackson
s
son
the
buttlin
jackson
ellery
nodded
grinning
he
recalled
old
henry
clay
in
his
buttling
suit
announcing
dinner
at
the
john
f
wrights
when
hermione
wright
had
introduced
ellery
to
her
intime
wrightsville
friends
during
his
first
visit
to
the
town
but
i
saw
abe
on
state
street
only
this
mornin
you
re
holdin
your
get
together
at
the
bayard
fox
house
mr
queen
oh
yes
i
believe
in
atmospheres
dakin
ellery
drummed
softly
on
the
chief
s
desk
staring
out
s
going
to
be
on
the
gruesome
side
he
muttered
dakin
winced
must
you
it
s
where
the
murder
took
place
but
that
house
is
a
tomb
mr
queen
it
s
been
sealed
up
for
a
dozen
years
i
d
feel
like
a
grave
robber
let
s
both
feel
like
grave
robbers
the
chief
stared
because
i
need
a
friendly
presence
complained
ellery
i
m
out
to
save
two
young
people
from
a
fate
at
least
as
bad
as
death
howie
is
a
depressing
leech
and
i
need
a
friendly
presence
dakin
dakin
reached
for
his
visored
hat
may
s
well
be
hanged
for
a
fool
as
a
jackass
he
grunted
shrugging
okay
mr
queen
let
s
go
rob
that
grave
later
that
morning
ellery
led
a
nervous
procession
across
two
lawns
to
the
stained
and
weather
cracked
door
of
bayard
fox
s
house
an
impression
almost
an
impact
door
with
the
tarnished
key
emily
fox
had
preserved
in
her
trinket
box
next
door
for
twelve
years
pas
he
pushed
the
door
open
it
screamed
it
was
as
if
the
house
itself
were
screaming
at
being
awakened
from
its
long
sleep
and
when
they
walked
into
the
musty
foyer
the
feeling
was
intensified
for
the
drawer
of
a
mahogany
reception
table
gaped
as
if
it
had
just
been
jerked
open
inside
they
could
see
a
puppy
s
leather
collar
a
frosted
electric
bulb
mess
of
papers
greeting
cards
laundry
hills
scribbled
housekeeping
memoranda
old
letters
a
torn
hairnet
some
marbles
a
wrightsville
record
dated
june
some
cracked
snapshots
the
litter
and
clutter
of
a
rumpus
drawer
such
as
all
living
households
no
matter
how
efficiently
managed
can
not
escape
maintaining
and
on
the
plum
striped
satin
seat
of
a
mahogany
chair
beside
the
table
lay
a
boy
s
pullover
red
sweater
where
it
had
been
cheerfully
tossed
as
if
only
yesterday
fine
dust
and
a
swarm
of
moths
and
collapsed
one
corner
of
the
domestic
oriental
rug
lapped
over
where
a
hurrying
foot
had
tripped
over
it
twelve
years
before
a
maxfield
parrish
reproduction
ogled
them
from
the
streaked
wallpaper
above
the
table
in
need
of
a
decent
leveling
touch
through
the
blanket
of
gray
dust
and
the
webs
of
spider
generations
which
choked
the
corners
of
the
hall
ceiling
they
perceived
a
house
not
in
death
but
in
smart
dragger
after
all
i
do
nt
know
i
ca
nt
tell
i
have
nt
the
final
say
in
such
matters
yet
money
talks
old
clem
said
this
is
fair
talk
cap
n
nora
and
useful
good
talk
all
here
will
stand
by
with
an
eye
peeled
but
what
about
the
fish
that
are
on
the
feed
now
do
we
get
them
tomorrow
or
be
foxed
out
of
them
she
cried
out
get
them
we
ll
kill
thirty
thousand
i
said
on
the
middle
ground
this
time
of
year
tide
and
wind
being
what
they
are
we
ll
be
needing
a
mark
buoy
whether
we
like
it
or
not
thereby
we
ll
not
have
to
take
any
man
s
word
as
to
where
the
fish
are
or
where
the
vessel
is
lying
go
tell
that
to
the
captain
said
nora
and
see
that
it
s
done
she
raised
her
i
ll
tell
him
myself
i
made
way
for
her
and
she
went
down
to
the
cabin
alone
the
captain
had
already
given
the
order
for
the
rigging
of
the
mark
buoy
despite
the
tragedy
which
had
attended
the
setting
of
their
last
mark
buoy
he
had
seen
that
one
was
required
for
the
middle
ground
tides
when
nora
came
down
into
the
cabin
he
was
lying
in
his
bunk
and
atkins
was
seated
on
the
locker
near
him
a
set
of
dry
cell
batteries
in
his
hands
either
he
or
lenotre
had
picked
up
a
lot
of
junk
at
shelburne
for
just
this
purpose
there
was
a
supply
of
old
lifebelts
and
electric
bulbs
handy
both
of
them
greeted
her
with
cheerful
faces
she
answered
by
hoping
that
lenotre
was
feeling
better
he
replied
the
truth
of
it
is
nora
that
when
i
fast
as
i
did
during
the
blow
it
takes
me
some
time
to
get
back
on
my
feed
i
m
all
right
and
i
m
obliged
to
you
for
at
once
she
wanted
to
disbelieve
all
that
she
had
heard
of
him
and
all
that
she
feared
now
yet
she
had
struck
on
a
way
that
might
bring
her
the
truth
and
she
was
determined
to
put
the
matter
to
its
test
she
therefore
sat
down
on
the
locker
opposite
them
and
idly
stared
at
atkins
clever
hands
over
the
gear
she
knew
he
had
a
good
reputation
as
a
rigger
of
such
buoys
it
was
the
only
good
thing
we
had
ever
heard
of
him
ile
made
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
stayed
upright
and
did
nt
sag
they
stayed
put
over
the
fish
too
she
watched
him
yet
she
lifted
her
eyes
now
and
then
to
trace
out
the
changes
in
the
captain
s
face
which
was
always
a
puzzle
to
her
and
to
me
he
seemed
to
be
more
than
usually
interested
in
atkins
task
and
kept
hustling
him
on
with
impatient
words
his
listless
mood
had
departed
some
inner
energy
newly
stirred
made
his
eyes
hand
through
his
matted
hair
and
she
remembered
long
afterward
he
once
laughed
aloud
for
no
reason
at
all
no
question
but
these
actions
forced
back
into
her
memory
certain
images
of
their
past
images
of
which
i
know
little
and
would
like
to
know
less
anyway
she
instinctively
let
her
eyelids
fall
halfway
and
for
a
time
kept
her
gaze
on
her
dirty
boots
it
was
the
nearness
of
a
once
loved
man
and
the
knowledge
that
at
any
moment
she
might
be
alone
with
him
which
brought
her
suddenly
to
her
feet
captain
lenotre
delayed
her
smoothly
stay
a
while
nora
please
i
ve
something
to
say
to
you
he
gave
to
his
voice
the
gentility
that
often
marked
his
weariness
after
long
fruitless
voyages
a
thing
i
d
marked
in
him
before
especially
when
he
was
telling
lies
if
nora
had
kept
her
wits
about
her
she
might
have
seen
that
this
was
his
old
blarney
nevertheless
it
suited
her
needs
before
nora
could
stand
straight
atkins
was
scurrying
up
the
steps
and
lenotre
was
at
her
side
his
hands
raised
in
the
moment
that
the
slide
closed
he
put
his
arm
around
her
in
rough
fashion
and
swung
her
toward
him
into
a
close
embrace
from
what
little
i
know
of
this
happening
there
being
a
plain
difficulty
involved
for
me
i
judge
that
the
captain
mistook
her
trembling
for
something
else
which
is
understandable
he
tried
hard
to
kiss
her
mouth
this
she
denied
to
him
she
thrust
against
him
in
silence
with
her
hands
he
did
nt
let
her
go
being
forewarned
she
perceived
that
his
emotion
was
a
fraud
and
that
he
had
quite
another
purpose
than
the
old
one
of
courting
her
she
then
learned
too
the
depths
of
her
duplicity
that
she
too
could
pretend
certain
things
if
it
meant
an
advantage
in
the
defense
of
the
golden
hind
she
lifted
her
hands
to
his
shoulders
and
turned
her
mouth
to
his
this
and
said
at
once
i
m
in
trouble
nora
awful
trouble
he
struck
his
hand
against
his
mouth
i
m
the
first
skipper
of
this
vessel
that
ever
took
whiskey
aboard
her
i
lied
to
you
a
minute
ago
about
being
off
my
feed
i
m
in
trouble
she
backed
away
from
the
ring
of
lamplight
in
order
to
clear
the
way
for
her
eyes
what
is
your
trouble
i
know
you
re
troubled
what
is
it
paul
parren
he
sent
a
wild
glance
toward
the
dark
skylight
as
if
he
could
see
the
glare
of
the
doubloon
s
deck
lamps
there
i
did
nt
want
to
tell
you
but
well
i
m
like
the
hind
herself
like
you
i
owe
him
money
lots
of
it
and
he
s
been
putting
the
gaff
on
me
for
it
how
come
you
to
owe
a
man
like
parren
so
much
she
had
made
a
slip
there
of
anything
but
friendliness
between
her
and
the
dragger
captain
he
did
nt
notice
that
meaning
in
her
words
he
wait
for
the
welcome
mat
to
be
put
out
five
thousand
somebody
yelled
what

a
quiet
voice
i

friendly
persuasion

to

what
the
ruckus

the
cannon

ready
to
let

in
the
middle
of

rebs
what

cannoneer
dropped
his
coal
and
before
they
could
get
another
the
rebs
took
the
gun
ought
a
court
martial
the
feller
who
done
that
fore
the
afternoon
s
over
grogan
you
ll
likely
change
your
tune
as
to
that
the
afternoon
wore
on
to
the
funky
smell
of
the
river
and
of
lush
river
growth
was
added
that
of
sweating
men
and
horses
josh
eased
rome
s
girth
and
hoisted
his
blankets
so
a
little
air
could
flow
under
them
back
in
the
saddle
he
felt
light
headed
and
detached
gum
had
been
right
about
the
cherries
they
were
nt
setting
right
he
felt
kind
of
sick
but
happy
he
d
got
here
he
was
all
right
he
was
where
he
belonged
muscatatuck
where
it
flowed
in
shallow
ripples
across
a
sandbar
then
darkened
as
the
channel
deepened
near
the
bridge
it
was
three
or
four
o
clock
the
sun
went
through
the
water
and
onto
the
sandbar
then
flashed
pulsing
with
the
movement
of
the
water
in
his
temples
he
could
see
the
silvery
glint
of
the
little
minnows
like
bullets
a
dragon
fly
ran
its
darning
needle
in
and
out
in
and
out
of
the
flowing
water
it
was
july
a
summer
afternoon
the
cool
water
the
hot
sun
the
darting
the
silver
bullets
josh
s
neck
stiffened
his
head
snapped
up
his
hand
closed
around
the
stock
of
his
gun
a
horseman
was
pounding
up
the
road
it
s
one
of
our
scouts
said
ben
whitey
the
rider
a
little
fellow
in
uniform
on
a
lathered
black
pulled
up
beside
the
captain
josh
could
nt
hear
what
he
was
saying
but
after
a
minute
the
captain
turned
and
told
them
his
voice
know
that
this
was
it
the
time
had
come
boys
he
said
they
re
closing
in
they
re
up
the
road
a
couple
of
miles
less
of
em
than
we
figured
i
expect
them
to
charge
there
s
just
two
things
to
remember
first
stand
steady
second
do
nt
fire
till
i
give
the
word
he
stood
in
his
stirrups
and
pounded
the
words
home
do
nt
fire
till
i
give
the
word
if
you
fire
before
you
can
make
your
shots
good
it
s
all
over
they
ll
ride
you
down
hold
it
your
guns
carry
just
as
far
as
theirs
and
you
re
better
shots
those
men
ve
been
in
the
saddle
for
weeks
now
and
it
s
telling
on
them
shoot
low
so
s
if
you
miss
a
man
you
get
a
horse
but
do
nt
miss
the
scout
went
on
past
them
at
a
gallop
and
josh
could
hear
the
black
s
hooves
ring
on
dust
of
the
road
on
the
west
bank
where
the
men
in
hiding
were
waiting
the
news
the
captain
himself
wheeled
round
to
await
the
attack
with
his
men
josh
reached
for
his
gun
waves
of
something
he
did
nt
know
what
were
hitting
his
chest
it
s
like
riding
through
the
woods
and
being
hit
by
branches
that
leave
thee
in
the
saddle
but
so
belabored
thy
chest
aches
he
thought
other
waves
or
perhaps
the
same
ones
pounded
against
his
cars
broke
in
deafening
crashes
as
if
he
were
deep
under
water
buffeted
by
currents
that
could
break
bones
could
rip
a
man
out
of
his
flesh
and
let
him
run
liquid
away
then
in
the
midst
of
the
pain
and
crashing
josh
thought
it
s
thy
heart
beating
nothing
but
thy
heart
gum
said
fix
those
lines
boy
and
again
get
those
reins
fixed
if
your
horse
jerks
his
head
he
ll
spoil
your
aim
josh
out
of
the
reins
and
rubbed
it
along
rome
s
neck
good
boy
he
said
good
old
rome
thee
ll
be
all
right
he
knew
he
was
encouraging
himself
rome
did
nt
need
cheering
he
stood
solid
as
a
meeting
house
only
his
big
head
moving
up
and
down
a
little
they
were
all
waiting
ben
whitey
was
cussing
a
long
line
of
words
as
if
he
was
dreaming
or
singing
in
a
kind
of
funny
way
but
they
were
mostly
quiet
listening
something
came
down
or
perhaps
it
came
up
out
of
the
earth
itself
something
very
thin
and
fine
like
a
spun
web
and
held
them
all
together
josh
could
feel
it
anybody
could
break
away
from
it
if
he
liked
but
while
they
headed
the
same
way
waited
the
same
thing
it
held
them
you
could
lean
against
it
like
steel
josh
felt
its
support
the
waves
beat
against
him
but
it
held
him
until
he
heard
the
first
sounds
a
rebel
yell
from
up
the
road
beyond
the
elder
thicket
then
another
josh
never
knew
a
man
could
make
a
sound
like
that
it
was
a
screech
such
as
an
animal
might
make
only
it
was
in
a
man
s
voice
a
voice
that
could
say
farewell
or
rain
tomorrow
and
that
made
it
worse
it
sounded
crazy
it
sounded
as
if
the
tongue
that
gave
it
could
lap
blood
it
broke
the
web
that
held
sweet
simplicity
of
the
band
seemed
as
stagy
and
false
to
tim
as
a
paul
whiteman
introduction
nevertheless
it
was
good
dance
music
with
a
strong
unbroken
rhythm
that
took
hold
and
he
and
rachel
danced
the
second
time
they
danced
they
passed
close
to
the
platform
and
arty
s
great
sad
eyes
in
the
white
sad
almost
homely
face
selected
them
he
leaned
over
and
asked
how
pare
you
timmy
in
the
slow
drawl
that
worked
like
the
smile
he
began
the
smile
for
rachel
they
had
to
stay
there
dancing
in
one
place
looking
up
at
him
ah
m
glad
you
came
out
arty
said
and
looked
at
rachel
again

meyer
arty

said
stubbornly
please

tell
me
arty
said
to
rachel
he
s
keepin
secrets
rachel
blushed
and
whitened
and
laughed
quickly
and
said
rachel
that

better
arty

i
m

and
glad
to
know
you
rachel
not
that
i
blame
timmy

le
moved
along
the
platform
beside
them
when
tim
started
to
dance
on
how

about
takin
the
fiddle

on
a
couple

tim
said
when
they
went
hack
to
the
table
rachel
did
nt
sit
down
let
s
go
she
said
it
s
getting
too
crowded
to
dance
for
him
to
answer
he
caught
up
with
her
in
the
entrance
to
the
lounge
where
the
cloak
room
and
the
gaming
tables
were
he
took
hold
of
her
elbow
did
you
want
me
to
play
that
rachy
he
asked
of
course
not
if
you
do
nt
want
to
he
let

of
her
arm
i
d
just
as
soon

if
you
want
me
to
heavens
tim
what
difference
does
it
make
will
you
get
my
wrap
please
it
s
just
that
it
all
sounds
so
phony
tonight
tim
said
i
did
nt
feel
like
getting
up
there
and
playing
stuff
like
that
on
your
last
night
and
everything
it
s
not
my
last
night
whatever
that
has
to
do
with
it
i
mean
for
me
tim
pleaded
i
did
nt
want
to
get
up
there
with
all
that
lousy
jazz
and
rachel
little
fury
in
her
eyes
again
tim
hazard
she
said
shakily
you
re
the
most
conceited
boy
i
ever
knew
then
tim
was
staring
at
her
i
le
was
astonished
and
deeply
hurt
and
bewildered
how
could
she
think
that
of
him
of
all
things
please
she
said
again
will
you
get
my
wrap
it
was
nt
until
they
were
outside
that
he
remembered
he
had
nt
tipped
the
check
girl
he
was
mortified
by
the
oversight
everything
was
going
wrong
it
was
nt
until
they
were
nearly
in
town
and
he
had
to
find
out
what
they
were
going
to
do
that
he
could
speak
again
we
could
still
see
a
second
show
he
said
rachel
did
nt
want
to
see
a
show
she
did
nt
want
to
go
anywhere
else
to
dance
either
she
said
she
had
a
headache
he
knew
she
wanted
to
go
home
and
he
knew
he
would
only
be
tanking
things
still
worse
began
in
him
but
he
could
nt
take
her
home
like
this
how
could
he
ever
start
to
give
her
the
moss
agate
when
it
was
like
this
between
them
we
ll
just
drive
for
a
while
then
he
said
maybe
the
air
will
help
it
was
awful
stuffy
and
smoky
in
there
where
do
you
want
to
go
i
do
nt
care
rachel
said
let
s
go
out
the
pyramid
road
he
said
wonderful
places
n
the
pyramid
road
came
to
his
mind
big
places
with
barren
mountains
and
long
empty
valleys
there
would
be
a
moon
before
long
too
it
came
to
him
that
they
could
even
go
all
the
ay
out
and
look
at
the
moonlight
on
the
lake
it
would
take
an
our
to
get
out
there
and
maybe
the
moon
would
be
up
then
nd
he
could
give
her
the
agate
while
they
looked
at
the
lake
t
would
nt
seem
so
important
or
so
hard
to
do
thinking
of
being
with
rachel
and
poking
at
the
moonlight
on
pyramid
all
right
rachel
said
sighing
she
cooked
out
the
window
on
her
side
but
i
ca
nt
be
out
late
tim
really
i
ca
nt
they
passed
through
the
city
and
out
the
familiar
road
beside
the
race
track
and
around
to
the
fork
by
the
ranch
house
that
looked
like
an
old
roadhouse
tim
swung
the
car
up
into
the
hills
when
they
were
over
the
first
summit
and
the
lights
were
gone
and
the
big
darkness
was
around
them
and
stars
over
the
mountains
he
spoke
what
makes
you
think
i
m
so
conceited
oh
tim
please
i
m
sorry
if
it
was
on
account
of
what
i
said
about
arty
s
band
tim
i
did
nt
mean
it
it
does
nt
matter
yes
it
does
he
said
it
did
nt
really
mean
arty
s
band
was
no
good
rachel
clenched
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looked
down
at
them
tim
saw
that
but
still
he
was
drawn
on
arty
s
got
a
swell
band
it
was
nt
anything
about
arty
s
band
it
was
just
because
it
was
your
last

last
night
with
you
and
i
did
nt
want
to
play
that
stuff
i
do
nt

or
tschaikowsky
or
debussy
s
la
mere
even
moonlight
and
roses
is
all
wrong
too
kind
of
soupy
too
much
make
believe
this
was
true
as
far
as
it
went
but
he
did
nt
go
on
because
just
that
much
with
rachel
sitting
there
looking
at
her
hands
sounded
like
a
pose
or
even
a
lie
anyway
he
said
trying
to
laugh
her
but
the
child
beat
her
off
you

it
she
screamed
at
verity

and
spurge
figured
out
just
how
much
was
coming
to
each
man
who
had
sent

with

verity
sat
quietly
making
no

to

unable

t

maw
asked
spurge
of
his
wife
she
shook
her
head
i
stayin
with
sunny
lou
he
nodded
a
feeling
of
distaste
hank
talk
about
lincoln
again
and
she
knew
he
would
get
everyone
in
this
village
pledged
to
give
a
dollar
a
year
and
to
spell
his
name
she
hated
to
stay
in
this
house
but
sunny
lou
s
sobs
were
no
longer
heard
and
perhaps
she
could
sit
out
on
the
funny
old
porch
and
let
the
sun
and
water
strengthen
her
may
i
stay
here
with
you
she
asked
lula
may
a
course
ma
am
a
course
hank
was
about
to
protest
she
knew
he
was
about
to
say
she
should
ought
a
meet
all
these
people
but
seeing
lula
may
s
pleased
expression
lie
only
nodded
after
the
nu
n
left
she
went
outside
she
leaned
against
the
pine
hoard
post
beside
the
steps
and
did
nt
care
that
the
sap
was
oozing
from
it
making
the
back
of
her
dress
gummy
she
sat
there
for
what
seemed
like
hours
sometimes
feeling
completely
blank
sometimes
remembering
the
scene
with
sunny
lou
sometimes
imagining
the
scene
at
the
the
people
learned
he
had
made
a
good
deal
for
them
the
sun
was
less
than
an
hour
from
setting
when
the
screen
door
behind
her
opened
and
closed
gently
looking
up
she
saw
sunny
lou
in
a
fresh
little
cotton
dress
a
really
lovely
shade
of
muted
pink
lula
may
stood
back
of
her
smiling
and
pleased
the
child
s
eyes
were
only
slightly
swollen
and
she
was
indeed
beautiful
to
look
upon
hank
online
this
sunny
lou
said
and
touched
her
skirt
verity
thought
again
that
hank
had
an
eye
for
color
and
usually
in
remarkably
good
taste
in
everything
except
his
own
clothes
then
the
realization
came
to
her
that
men
s
clothes
were
awfully
patterned
and
hank
s
love
of
color
could
nt
be
satisfied
within
the
boundaries
set
for
gentlemen
the
pink
dress
completed
the
picture
that
was
sunny
lou
the
flamingo
and
her
yellowish
hazel
eyes
looked
oddly
at
verity
i
should
ought
a
be
shamed
the
child
said
n
i
am
too
nt
look
the
least
bit
ashamed
verity
thought
but
she
said
it
s
all
right
sunny
lou
i
did
nt
mean
it
when
i
said
you
ketched
him
in
a
trap
liken
a
muskrat
liken
maw
says
i
should
ought
a
you
ve
met
the
fellow
who
writes
to
you
if
you
remember
him
and
what
you
thought
of
him
well
when
he
writes
to
you
you
get
to
know
him
that
much
better
and
his
letters
seem
to
be
extraordinary
things
they
seem
to
come
from
something
that
s
in
every
man
in
the
world
and
as
far
as
i
ve
been
able
to
tell
that
thing
is
loneliness
man
is
a
lonely
creature
in
spite
of
all
the
company
there
is
for
him
in
the
sometimes
he
ll
turn
away
from
all
the
company
in
the
world
and
take
up
with
the
dead
he
ll
read
the
books
men
who
lived
long
ago
wrote
or
he
ll
take
up
with
the
fields
and
the
sky
and
the
creatures
of
them
like
thoreau
did
or
he
ll
turn
to
some
little
domestic
animal
like
a
dog
or
a
canary
or
a
parrot
or
a
turtle
even
or
a
goldfish
or
maybe
a
big
animal
like
a
horse
they
say
arabs
love
their
horses
more
than
their
wives
or
he
ll
take
up
with
plants
in
a
little
garden
of
his
own
or
if
he
has
no
garden
he
ll
take
up
with
little
plants
in
pots
but
who
s
he
looking
for
all
the
time
he
s
looking
for
somebody
to
know
him
every
letter
i
ever
got
had
loneliness
in
it
and
eagerness
to
be
in
touch
with
someone
who
was
not
a
stranger
someone
who
remembered
pharry
cook
s
letters
were
a
big
surprise
because
i
expected
them
were
nt
they
were
full
of
longing
and
nothing
else
most
people
long
for
something
they
ve
already
known
such
as
a
home
or
a
farm
or
some
neighborhood
of
a
town
or
city
but
harry
s
longing
was
for
the
stuff
that
was
ahead
the
thing
i
m
hoping
for
he
wrote
in
one
of
his
letters
is
to
be
let
alone
some
day
so
i
can
see
if
i
can
find
out
how
to
spend
my
life
if
i
had
my
way
i
d
never
grow
old
and
neither
would
anybody
else
i
d
just
go
to
sleep
some
afternoon
under
some
old
apple
tree
and
never
wake
up
again
joe
foxhall
s
letters
were
not
half
as
serious
as
his
talk
he
told
me
the
little
things
that
had
happened
to
him
and
he
poked
fun
at
the
officers
he
knew
dominic
tosca
was
interested
in
only
one
thing
how
was
victor
victor
wrote
to
him
more
often
than
i
did
but
dominic
wanted
me
to
we
got
shipped
try
to
work
it
out
to
stay
with
him
he
said
pop
s
letters
were
the
shortest
i
got
your
letter
he
would
scribble
read
ecclesiastes
again
once
quickly
then
two
or
three
times
slowly
or
i
got
your
letter
i
m
reading
anderson
i
think
you
ll
like
him
too
so
i
d
write
and
tell
him
i
was
reading
anderson
too
and
i
d
mention
some
of
the
stories
and
pop
would
write
back
and
say
hans
christian
is
o
k
but
i
mean
sher
wood
i
wrote
to
cacalokowitz
once
too
he
was
a
good
fellow
just
as
i
had
expected
and
he
said
he
was
sorry
he
had
nt
answered
sooner
but
he
had
been
working
very
hard
training
a
new
company
of
men
you
d
be
surprised
he
wrote
how
much
alike
the
men
of
every
new
company
are
the
reason
i
wrote
so
many
letters
was
that
they
organization
so
i
had
a
lot
of
time
i
used
to
keep
four
or
five
sharpened
pencils
in
my
pocket
and
i
used
to
keep
a
tablet
with
me
all
the
time
and
envelopes
so
when
everybody
else
was
listening
to
the
stuff
about
who
s
who
in
the
army
and
how
to
tell
for
sure
or
how
to
get
along
when
you
re
lost
in
the
desert
i
d
be
in
the
back
of
the
room
writing
to
pop
or
lou
or
joe
foxhall
or
dominic
after
we
d
finished
school
the
sergeant
asked
me
if
i
wanted
topdo
some
typing
for
him
and
i
said
i
did
so
after
that
i
had
a
desk
and
a
typewriter
and
spent
most
of
my
time
typing
announcements
and
reports
for
him
i
had
a
little
cubby
hole
of
a
room
of
my
own
on
the
same
floor
with
the
writers
so
i
guess
it
was
natural
for
them
to
think
i
was
a
writer
too
once
in
a
while
one
of
them
would
come
by
and
sit
on
the
end
of
my
i
d
tell
him
so
then
he
d
say
i
do
nt
mean
for
the
army
i
mean
for
yourself
i
m
writing
a
play
wesley
meets
the
army
film
writers
and
after
seeing
their
training
films
is
nt
sure
they
are
nt
the
real
enemy
there
were
about
fifty
writers
in
the
writing
department
in
new
york
i
had
to
type
a
list
of
them
one
day
for
the
sergeant
so
i
knew
their
names
but
i
did
nt
seem
to
remember
having
read
a
book
by
any
of
them
i
took
the
list
with
me
to
the
public
library
on
nd
street
one
saturday
afternoon
to
look
them
up
one
by
one
alphabetically
well
only
one
of
them
had
published
a
book
i
wrote
the
number
of
the
book
on
a
slip
of
paper
the
book
was
fetched
for
me
and
i
sat
down
to
read
it
well
it
was
a
book
all
right
it
was
printed
on
paper
and
it
had
covers
it
was
a
story
too
encountered
in
all
the
reading
i
ve
done
i
read
twenty
pages
at
the
beginning
ten
at
the
end
and
two
in
the
middle
but
it
was
tiresome
no
matter
where
i
went
i
wondered
what
kind
of
writers
these
writers
were
there
did
nt
seem
to
be
fifty
writers
in
the
whole
country
worth
reading
but
there
they
were
fifty
of
he
did
nt
get
doc
hinton
but
he
got
jinnie
who
had
successfully
delivered
three
babies
for
them
and
it
was
through
jinnie
slemp
and
two
neighbor
women
there
the
night
their
child
was
born
the
story
got
out
that
the
baby
was
marked
with
the
devil
vennie
didmore
vera
pratt
and
midwife
jinnie
slemp
all
told
the
same
story
to
the
women
in
blakesburg
they
said
the
baby
was
born
dead
and
that
it
was
well
and
good
it
was
born
dead
said
it
was
born
with
a
long
tail
and
on
its
forehead
were
two
little
horns
like
noah
put
the
dead
baby
in
a
box
and
carried
it
somewhere
upon
the
mountain
and
buried
it
he
would
nt
let
anybody
see
it
but
these
women
had
already
seen
it
and
they
spread
the
news
how
it
was
marked
with
the
devil
but
everybody
agreed
that
it
should
be
marked
with
the
devil
the
way
bertha
and
noah
had
lived
since
noah
was
a
son
of
satan
and
bertha
was
satan
s
daughter
charlie
allbright
said
he
had
heard
from
reliable
sources
that
both
noah
and
bertha
had
gone
out
on
the
dark
mountaintop
away
from
the
town
at
night
and
had
prayed
to
the
devil
uglybird
skelton
had
told
charlie
allbright
that
he
was
digging
a
grave
one
night
when
noah
and
bertha
came
to
pray
to
the
devil
and
that
he
ran
them
off
lonesome
hill
with
a
mattock
and
now
the
devil
had
betrayed
noah
and
bertha
and
no
wonder
they
had
paid
the
price
by
bertha
s
having
a
marked
baby
for
their
getting
mixed
up
with
such
company
reece
nimrod
had
once
taken
a
party
of
six
the
child
was
buried
to
hunt
for
its
grave
they
knew
they
would
see
the
signs
of
fresh
dirt
if
they
went
soon
enough
they
found
the
signs
of
fresh
dirt
which
had
been
packed
down
by
a
recent
rain
but
they
dug
through
the
packed
dirt
with
their
mattocks
shoveled
it
away
with
their
spades
and
had
the
top
of
the
box
off
where
they
could
peep
in
when
out
of
a
clear
sky
the
clouds
begin
boiling
up
like
giant
thunderheads
then
it
started
thundering
and
lightening
and
the
rain
poured
so
they
threw
dirt
back
onto
the
grave
and
took
off
through
the
rain
down
the
mountain
side
with
their
mattocks
and
shovels
but
they
said
the
rain
was
the
work
of
the
devil
for
they
had
nt
run
a
quarter
of
a
mile
until
they
reached
sunshine
and
dry
earth
anybody
in
blakesburg
will
tell
you
if
you
go
into
the
patch
of
woods
where
this
devil
marked
baby
is
buried
that
it
will
start
thundering
and
lightening
and
the
rain
will
start
pouring
many
people
have
tried
it
and
the
discovery
told
the
townspeople
the
truth
but
the
devil
s
sending
this
baby
to
bertha
and
noah
changed
their
whole
lives
just
as
soon
as
a
tent
meeting
came
to
blakesburg
where
the
holiness
preacher
spoke
through
a
loudspeaker
not
just
to
the
tent
packed
with
people
but
to
the
people
all
over
the
town
it
put
bertha
and
noah
on
the
lord
s
side
they
were
sitting
on
the
porch
of
their
shack
near
the
railroad
tracks
listening
to
the
good
guitar
music
and
the
singing
by
the
gospel
singers
and
the
words
of
the
little
preacher
when
they
got
the
call
and
ran
to
the
tent
there
they
threw
themselves
upon
the
altar
and
they
had
some
confession
to
make
they
confessed
to
their
allegiance
with
the
devil
how
they
said
they
had
thought
he
was
being
mistreated
because
they
had
only
heard
god
s
story
and
not
the
devil
s
story
they
told
how
they
had
gotten
all
lickered
up
on
the
devil
s
medicine
and
went
to
the
mountain
top
together
and
had
prayed
to
the
devil
one
of
these
meetings
on
the
mountaintop
when
they
were
under
the
influence
of
the
devil
before
the
tent
packed
with
people
they
made
all
these
confessions
and
warned
the
people
to
beware
of
the
devil
for
he
would
in
the
end
betray
them
it
was
such
a
good
message
that
the
little
preacher
wanted
to
get
it
over
to
his
people
in
the
town
he
had
them
to
make
another
confession
through
the
loudspeaker
so
all
the
people
in
the
town
would
hear
and
then
came
the
payoff
for
the
tent
meeting
when
a
man
and
a
woman
as
wicked
as
noah
and
bertha
billups
could
get
saved
and
redeemed
by
the
blood
there
was
a
chance
for
everybody
no
matter
how
wicked
no
matter
what
he
had
done
and
people
fell
to
their
knees
until
the
confession
altar
was
packed
and
the
floor
of
the
tent
was
full
there
had
never
been
such
revival
and
soul
warming
as
this
tent
meeting
with
the
little
preacher
the
good
guitar
music
and
the
gospel
singers
that
was
why
noah
and
skies
bertha
the
time
has
come
noah
said
as
they
stood
side
by
side
on
their
front
porch
looking
toward
the
north
with
light
in
their
eyes
christ
is
a
coming
bertha
put
her
arm
around
noah
and
hugged
close
to
him
while
he
beamed
with
happiness
and
lifted
his
face
toward
the
great
panorama
of
light
honey
i
m
glad
bertha
said
i
m
glad
we
saw
the
light
two
years
ago
glory
be
to
god
noah
said
joyously
waving
his
hands
above
his
head
glory
be
to
god
christ
s
a
comin
look
fer
him
in
the
clouds
when
their
children
heard
noah
shouting
they
ran
out
on
the
porch
to
see
what
was
going
on
what
caused
that
light
papa
asked
the
oldest
one
christ
is
comin
herbie
noah
said
we
re
a
goin
to
leave
blakesburg
where
we
a
goin
papa
daisy
bertha
said
not
in
these
clothes
mama
herbie
said
while
the
little
one
tagged
at
bertha
s
dress
frightened
until
he
screamed
at
the
alone
for
she
was
a
woman
who
would
never
be
completely
herself
except
through
another
person
within
a
relationship
and
for
all
its
outward
slightness
this
was
a
real
relationship
and
one
which
fully
occupied
her
heart
strange
she
thought
as
she
and
then
the
intoxication
of
the
smoke
in
her
lungs
looking
out
as
she
had
done
a
million
times
on
the
red
tiled
roofs
opposite
and
the
row
of
pigeons
six
years
of
her
life
were
framed
by
this
static
scene
strange
how
in
a
novel
it
would
be
inconceivable
that
she
should
still
be
sitting
here
no
writer
she
thought
half
amused
at
the
idea
would
dare
to
hold
two
people
in
such
suspense
for
so
long
a
time
once
on
some
warm
spring
evening
he
would
have
kissed
her
or
more
likely
the
tension
would
have
exploded
finally
in
a
quarrel
and
she
would
have
left
the
business
as
indeed
she
had
thought
of
doing
many
times
but
a
real
life
was
so
much
longer
and
more
obscure
than
a
life
in
any
novel
for
the
novelist
inevitably
looks
to
the
few
moments
of
crisis
to
illuminate
his
characters
whereas
she
thought
character
is
really
developed
and
matured
in
the
interminable
spaces
between
in
six
years
paul
and
still
she
sat
here
looking
at
the
red
roofs
and
the
pigeons
waiting
for
him
to
finish
his
drawing
and
talk
to
her
as
she
had
done
years
and
years
ago
and
still
the
suspense
was
there
the
bubble
of
excitement
in
her
throat
when
she
knocked
at
the
door
the
sense
of
something
imminent
between
them
which
might
at
any
moment
in
all
the
years
have
resolved
itself
and
yet
she
saw
now
would
never
never
do
so
what
is
jacques
doing
she
asked
suddenly
oh
i
do
nt
know
paul
answered
indifferently
still
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
he
s
got
a
little
shop
of
his
own
now
and
makes
a
good
living
mending
old
furniture
and
making
an
occasional
piece
he
has
become
a
satisfied
paterfamilias
he
has
settled
down
his
tone
mocked
the
words
as
if
nothing
could
be
more
stupid
and
fruitless
than
jacques
s
life
we
never
see
him
any
more
and
then
a
point
before
laying
it
down
he
added
what
made
you
ask
and
sat
down
with
a
sigh
opposite
her
thinking
as
he
did
so
we
are
getting
old
my
poor
louise
for
she
did
indeed
look
badly
this
morning
i
was
wondering
about
francoise
paul
shrugged
oh
francoise
has
forgotten
all
that
that
s
ancient
history
at
her
age
six
years
is
an
eternity
and
at
our
age
she
smiled
a
little
sadly
a
moment
an
interminable
moment
which
is
quite
a
different
thing
we
have
nt
changed
or
hardly
but
francoise
is
a
different
person
what
is
she
like
i
never
see
her
any
more
paul
smoked
for
a
moment
in
silence
he
was
thinking
of
how
little
he
really
knew
of
his
eldest
daughter
she
has
succeeded
admirably
in
divorcing
herself
from
her
family
she
lives
with
us
but
that
is
the
most
that
can
be
talk
about
her
plans
and
her
work
but
as
for
what
really
goes
on
inside
her
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
he
smiled
with
a
trace
of
bitterness
she
has
made
her
escape
is
she
happy
louise
asked
innocently
a
perfectly
irrelevant
question
no
one
is
happy
at
twenty
one
she
s
fearfully
ambitious
she
is
determined
to
be
graduated
avec
la
plus
grande
distinction
i
have
an
idea
that
she
has
wrapped
her
emotional
life
up
in
a
sort
of
cocoon
for
the
time
being
but
how
do
i
know
he
added
she
never
brings
any
of
her
school
friends
home
any
more
all
sorts
of
things
may
be
going
on
and
that
does
nt
worry
you
and
madame
louise
could
nt
imagine
melanie
not
knowing
what
was
happening
to
her
children
everyone
spoke
of
the
duchesne
family
as
the
closest
the
most
intimately
linked
of
any
family
they
knew
it
had
often
been
discussed
downstairs
that
and
the
well
paul
said
quietly
you
know
it
was
a
battle
for
years
but
then
francoise
won
after
the
business
about
jacques
she
never
confided
in
us
again
she
s
a
strong
character
stronger
even
than
her
mother
because
she
is
more
personally
ambitious
and
even
melanie
finally
understood
that
francoise
had
won
her
independence
not
by
moving
out
by
going
away
which
i
m
sure
she
must
have
considered
but
within
the
family
that
is
quite
a
triumph
eh
he
ended
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
triumph
immensely
himself
you
are
generous
paul
no
i
m
not
generous
not
a
bit
i
should
be
fearfully
jealous
of
any
man
francoise
loved
which
is
i
suppose
why
it
s
a
good
thing
that
i
am
unaware
of
that
not
impossible
he
if
he
exists
and
then
he
added
as
an
afterthought
melanie
is
generous
yes
she
is
on
that
made
them
inevitably
think
of
themselves
louise
especially
with
her
divided
loyalty
could
never
hear
the
name
without
a
sharp
pain
and
feeling
the
emotion
in
the
silence
paul
was
drawn
in
spite
of
himself
to
speak
to
explore
the
wound
to
put
a
new
dressing
on
it
it
s
not
been
a
very
gay
six
years
for
you
my
poor
louise
he
said
gently
i
do
nt
know
she
said
looking
at
him
steadily
with
her
clear
glance
not
gay
perhaps
not
empty
either
at
least
she
added
half
humorously
i
have
nt
settled
down
paul
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
he
was
irritated
with
himself
for
going
on
with
this
irritated
by
his
own
lack
of
courage
with
his
holding
on
to
her
love
because
in
some
way
he
needed
it
now
if
she
were
not
there
in
that
chair
for
an
hour
or
so
every
day
he
would
miss
little
and
that
so
negative
little
more
than
this
irritation
this
rest
lessness
and
startled
one
evening
at
sundown
by
a
sudden
great
blowing
of
horns
on
the
roof
tops
supplemented
by
the
firing
of
cannon
on
the
forts
and
a
more
than
ordinary
hullabaloo
on
the
part
of
the
muezzinsin
the
minarets
at
first
we
were
apprehensive
what
all
this
might
mean
fearing
some
new
victory
by
the
tripolines
but
hamet
who
had
just
finished
our
daily
lesson
in
arabic
explained
that
it
only
marked
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
ramadan
in
which
all
moslems
are
called
upon
to
fast
and
no
true
follower
of
lips
from
sunup
until
sundown
as
may
be
imagined
this
somewhat
complicated
our
task
for
the
prohibition
against
food
and
drink
it
appeared
extended
also
to
medicines
however
we
got
around
this
difficulty
by
sleeping
all
day
and
visiting
our
patients
by
night
when
whatever
we
ordered
was
taken
with
good
grace
during
this
period
cowdery
had
the
good
fortune
to
cement
our
relations
with
the
bashaw
by
curing
his
child
of
a
particularly
virulent
bout
of
the
intermittent
fever
while
i
solidified
our
relations
with
the
porte
by
attending
the
ambassador
from
constantinople
i
was
returning
from
one
of
my
visits
to
this
gentleman
s
house
one
evening
when
i
was
called
to
while
passing
a
coffee
stall
and
requested
to
enter
upon
responding
i
found
the
lord
high
admiral
of
tripoli
no
other
than
our
old
enemy
peter
lysle
the
scotch
runagate
who
under
the
name
of
murad
rais
had
commanded
the
bashaw
s
ships
which
the
essex
had
so
long
since
bottled
up
in
gibraltar
he
did
not
recognize
me
nor
did
and
invited
me
to
be
seated
beside
him
among
the
cushions
and
offered
me
coffee
in
thimble
sized
cups
after
some
polite
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
he
inquired
after
captain
bainbridge
and
how
we
did
he
came
to
the
point
and
stated
that
he
had
heard
that
i
had
some
skill
in
medicine
and
surgery
i
replied
that
i
did
my
best
in
my
humble
way
whereupon
he
asked
me
if
i
would
accept
him
as
a
patient
when
i
told
him
that
i
would
be
glad
to
do
what
i
could
for
him
he
beamed
and
pulled
up
his
shirt
to
show
me
a
great
malignant
carbuncle
upon
his
belly
he
wanted
it
removed
he
told
me
not
so
much
because
of
the
pain
which
was
negligible
but
rather
because
of
the
effect
it
had
upon
his
wives
who
he
said
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
upon
it
without
shuddering
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
picture
but
said
that
i
would
have
to
operate
upon
it
i
thought
it
could
be
done
was
agreeable
but
even
pressed
me
to
perform
the
surgery
on
the
earliest
possible
occasion
accordingly
a
day
or
two
later
i
did
so
making
a
very
clean
job
of
it
i
will
say
for
him
that
he
scarcely
flinched
once
under
the
knife
although
i
was
obliged
to
go
quite
deep
to
get
at
the
roots
of
the
growth
ile
made
an
excellent
recovery
and
apparently
his
domestic
difficulties
were
solved
for
he
was
so
delighted
that
he
became
a
fast
friend
after
his
fashion
and
had
me
often
to
his
house
for
supper
entertaining
me
lavishly
with
both
food
and
drink
for
although
he
had
turned
turk
his
conscience
remained
elastic
in
the
matter
of
alcohol
on
these
occasions
he
would
have
in
the
slave
girls
from
his
harem
and
have
them
dance
for
us
all
the
while
urging
me
to
turn
my
coat
and
settle
down
in
tripoli
where
he
vowed
i
could
make
a
fortune
as
a
physician
i
confess
i
was
sometimes
tempted
he
had
a
nice
taste
who
looks
upon
mountains
of
flesh
as
an
attribute
of
beauty
and
stupidity
as
a
female
virtue
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
offer
me
my
pick
barring
of
course
his
wives
of
which
he
had
three
but
his
price
was
too
high
and
i
found
myself
always
able
gently
but
firmly
to
refuse
our
cordiality
toward
one
another
was
in
no
way
affected
by
my
obdurateness
and
later
when
he
called
upon
me
to
treat
his
wives
for
various
ailments
of
the
country
i
came
to
understand
his
concern
over
his
former
difficulties
for
if
his
dancing
girls
were
lovely
these
three
made
them
all
look
like
broomstick
witches
by
the
end
of
ramadan
we
had
settled
down
to
a
routine
which
was
not
unbearable
early
in
february
the
bashaw
appointed
cowdery
physician
to
his
family
and
myself
physician
to
the
court
a
day
or
two
later
he
issued
an
edict
permitting
the
officers
to
walk
out
in
groups
of
six
under
guard
about
the
town
and
i
flatter
due
at
least
in
part
to
our
good
services
apart
from
the
fact
that
we
remained
prisoners
we
might
have
found
ourselves
reasonably
content
a
forceful
reminder
however
remained
of
our
shame
this
was
the
philadelphia
which
now
lay
close
under
the
guns
of
the
forts
and
within
sight
from
our
windows
much
had
been
accomplished
upon
her
her
foremast
had
been
replaced
and
her
tattered
rigging
repaired
her
guns
had
been
raised
and
remounted
even
her
anchors
had
been
brought
up
and
bent
to
new
cables
murad
rais
gleefully
took
pains
to
inform
me
that
he
had
been
appointed
to
command
her
and
announced
that
within
the
month
he
expected
to
put
to
sea
at
the
same
time
playfully
jabbing
me
in
the
ribs
and
bidding
me
mind
what
liberties
i
took
with
his
harem
in
his
absence
one
afternoon
toward
mid
february
cowdery
and
i
were
called
to
treat
the
bashaw
s
eldest
daughter
whose
husband
was
minister
of
war
her
case
was
not
complicated
and
we
prescribed
for
her
we
did
so
hamet
called
our
attention
to
two
merchantmen
out
beyond
the
reefs
beating
in
for
the
harbor
we
looked
at
them
without
much
interest
a
small
brig
of
somehow
rather
familiar
lines
and
a
ketch
of
mediterranean
gone
on
like
that
deep
in
its
routine
and
ended
in
comparative
tranquility
if
dowdy
had
not
appeared
perhaps
the
doctor
would
have
remained
merely
pensively
philosophical
perhaps
although
these
things
are
by
no
means
certain
it
could
be
persuasively
argued
that
the
imminent
departure
of
lieutenant
roberts
was
too
shocking
a
mutation
for
the
ship
to
absorb
without
a
brief
compensatory
period
of
chaos
or
it
could
be
more
baldly
argued
that
certain
factions
of
the
ship
s
company
were
simply
ready
for
a
good
bender
at
any
rate
dowdy
did
appear
and
the
evening
did
attain
to
a
certain
violence
and
the
doctor
did
to
a
certain
extent
go
berserk
as
a
drunk
the
doc
was
of
the
unpredictable
sort
up
to
a
certain
point
he
was
disciplined
if
loquacious
beyond
that
point
the
doc
got
pretty
primitive
there
was
the
time
at
an
officers
club
at
one
of
the
islands
when
he
tried
to
do
battle
with
a
four
striper
silly
looking
who
was
not
only
twice
his
rank
but
twice
his
size
as
well
if
he
had
not
been
also
twice
as
drunk
the
doctor
would
undoubtedly
have
been
a
candidate
for
portsmouth
naval
prison
that
was
one
time
and
there
had
been
several
others
it
was
after
ten
o
clock
when
dowdy
knocked
on
the
door
he
stood
sober
and
purposeful
in
the
doorway
hear
you
re
leaving
us
he
addressed
roberts
when
this
was
confirmed
he
went
on
well
a
few
of
us
are
having
a
little
party
down
in
the
armory
and
they
said
for
me
to
ask
you
down
to
have
a
drink
with
us
that
s
all
of
you
naturally
he
added
roberts
questioned
the
doc
with
a
look
sure
thing
said
the
doc
expansively
hell
yes
we
ll
have
a
drink
but
first
you
have
one
with
us
dowdy
did
that
and
he
did
better
than
that
he
had
two
then
the
doc
said
we
might
as
well
quart
of
alcohol
now
reduced
to
less
than
a
pint
stuck
it
under
his
shirt
and
then
in
single
file
the
doc
leading
ensign
pulver
trailing
the
group
repaired
to
the
armory
they
met
a
noisy
reception
the
new
party
was
already
in
an
advanced
state
the
armory
was
not
a
large
room
and
now
it
was
crowded
there
was
olson
of
course
and
there
was
stefanowski
of
course
kalinka
the
shipfitter
and
vanessi
the
storekeeper
were
sitting
on
the
workbench
the
two
gunner
s
mates
wiley
and
schaffer
were
leaning
on
the
rifle
rack
denowsky
was
not
fixed
but
mobile
wandering
up
and
down
the
large
ten
gallon
crock
sat
on
the
deck
in
almost
the
geometrical
center
of
the
room
right
away
the
doc
made
a
perfect
gesture
one
that
symbolically
and
in
fact
wedded
the
two
groups
he
pulled
out
the
bottle
of
alcohol
flourished
it
and
emptied
its
contents
into
the
crock
the
cheers
were
almost
deafening
dowdy
was
of
the
amalgamated
alcohol
and
jungle
juice
for
the
newcomers
this
here
is
a
brand
new
batch
he
explained
to
them
it
turned
out
pretty
good
the
last
batch
we
made
there
was
something
the
matter
with
it
i
guess
we
let
it
set
too
long
it
had
kind
of
a
green
crust
on
top
wiley
there
drank
some
and
he
peed
green
the
next
day
what
do
you
suppose
caused
that
doc
oh
some
kind
of
a
fungus
growth
in
the
bladder
the
doc
said
airily
this
is
good
stuff
yeah
said
dowdy
anyway
i
give
that
last
batch
away
to
the
engineers
it
did
nt
look
good
to
me
and
you
ca
nt
hurt
an
engineer
then
the
toasts
began
stefanowski
made
the
first
and
considering
the
occasion
it
was
just
about
perfect
although
he
stood
a
little
unsteadily
his
words
were
firm
and
brave
now
by
god
this
drink
is
for
the
roberts
and
that
ai
nt
saying
nothing
against
the
rest
of
you
officers
because
i
think
we
got
a
good
bunch
of
officers
on
this
ship
stefanowski
paused
and
qualified
except
for
that
shithead
of
a
captain
and
i
think
we
got
the
best
of
the
lot
here
tonight
but
by
god
i
say
and
i
bet
you
other
officers
agree
with
me
that
mister
roberts
is
absolutely
the
tops
and
i
m
sure
sorry
to
see
him
go
and
by
god
i
think
we
ought
to
drink
to
him
it
is
hard
to
see
how
it
could
have
been
more
nicely
put
and
stefanowski
s
toast
was
promptly
and
noisily
executed
there
were
many
others
the
toast
idea
caught
the
fancy
of
the
party
and
the
level
of
the
improved
jungle
juice
went
down
markedly
in
the
crock
after
all
present
had
been
honored
toasts
were
drunk
to
among
others
bela
kun
chili
williams
the
captain
s
early
demise
girls
who
wore
black
pants
no
pants
cordell
hull
winnie
ruth
judd
boo
boo
hoff
and
marjorie
ann
lundberg
of
coffeyville
kansas
these
necessarily
took
a
long
time
though
not
as
long
as
you
might
expect
and
in
the
course
of
them
dowdy
sidled
over
to
lieutenant
roberts
say
he
said
secretively
tom
olson
s
got
a
good
idea
he
says
we
ought
to
take
care
of
the
old
man
s
palm
trees
tonight
you
know
the
old
man
s
got
that
watch
up
there
now
but
olson
says
that
red
mclaughlin
went
on
at
midnight
and
hell
if
he
did
he
s
asleep
by
now
hell
it
s
twelve
fifteen
and
you
know
red
mclaughlin
so
maybe
if
you
and
me
and
olson
sort
of
sneak
up
there
now
the
thing
was
done
with
style
dowdy
was
right
red
mclaughlin
was
asleep
propped
against
the
captain
s
bulkhead
the
two
palm
trees
were
removed
from
their
five
gallon
cans
and
dumped
over
the
side
red
mclaughlin
was
sleeping
with
both
arms
outstretched
and
the
and
olson
did
everything
they
insisted
it
was
their
turn
roberts
s
role
was
that
of
honored
observer
and
summers
said
his
hand
came
over
and
gave
boone
the
empty
rifle
and
took
the
loaded
one
and
drew
away
with
it
load
up
the
indians
had
sat
watching
the
one
and
yelling
for
him
they
hushed
when
he
fell
and
then
all
began
to
yell
again
the
voices
rising
shrill
and
falling
they
set
their
horses
to
a
run
streaking
to
one
side
and
then
the
other
not
coming
directly
at
boone
and
summers
but
working
closer
as
the
line
went
back
and
forth
sometimes
one
bolder
than
the
rest
would
charge
out
of
the
line
and
come
nearer
waving
his
gun
or
bow
while
he
shouted
and
then
go
back
to
the
line
again
hold
your
sights
on
one
said
summers
the
one
on
the
speckled
pony
hold
fire
till
i
tell
you
then
plumb
center
with
it
he
had
taken
his
pistols
from
his
belt
and
had
them
out
before
him
on
the
horses
swinging
to
the
off
side
as
they
turned
shoo
summers
said
they
ca
nt
ride
for
nothin
ca
nt
shine
with
comanches
or
even
crows
why
nt
they
charge
all
of
em
summers
eye
ran
along
the
barrel
of
his
gun
they
got
no
stummick
for
that
kind
of
doin
s
save
once
in
a
while
one
likes
to
shine
alone
like
that
nigger
out
there
a
rifle
cracked
and
in
front
of
them
the
ground
exploded
in
a
little
blast
of
dust
steady
time
to
go
ag
in
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
boone
saw
smoke
puff
from
the
gun
a
running
horse
stumbled
and
fell
the
indians
shouted
higher
and
wilder
the
fallen
horse
lay
on
its
rider
boone
saw
the
rider
just
the
head
and
jerking
hands
of
him
beyond
the
horse
trying
to
pull
his
leg
free
summers
handed
over
the
empty
rifle
two
from
the
off
sides
of
their
horses
and
stooping
behind
the
downed
horse
rolled
the
withers
up
the
fallen
rider
tried
to
arise
and
went
off
crawling
dragging
one
leg
the
others
driven
back
a
little
by
the
shot
began
to
come
in
again
working
to
and
fro
one
of
them
bobbed
up
and
swung
his
rifle
over
the
ball
sang
past
boone
he
had
the
rifle
primed
again
and
the
indian
on
the
speckled
pony
on
his
sights
kin
i
shoot
one
he
did
nt
wait
the
sights
seemed
to
steady
of
themselves
and
fix
just
above
the
pony
s
neck
his
fingers
bore
on
the
trigger
like
it
had
a
mind
of
its
own
the
rifle
jumped
i
be
dogged
the
speckled
pony
shied
off
behind
him
a
man
squirmed
on
the
ground
squirmed
and
got
up
and
went
back
bent
at
the
middle
slicker
n
ice
caudill
the
indians
bunched
up
talking
and
gesturing
said
summers
raising
his
cheek
from
his
rifle
he
added
for
now
that
s
the
boat
the
trumpet
had
sounded
cutting
through
the
still
air
rolling
up
river
and
out
to
the
hills
and
coming
back
on
itself
boone
saw
the
mandan
the
oars
made
little
even
flashes
as
the
men
laid
them
back
someone
was
busy
in
the
bow
it
looked
like
jourdonnais
it
was
him
working
at
the
swivel
gun
which
was
a
bar
of
light
in
the
how
the
indians
looked
holding
their
horses
tight
easing
them
backward
away
from
the
river
the
swivel
belched
smoke
and
the
sound
of
it
came
to
them
a
rolling
boom
like
thunder
jourdonnais
got
busy
with
it
again
first
shot
was
just
to
skeer
em
second
ll
be
business
but
the
sioux
drew
off
turning
back
and
shouting
and
shaking
their
arms
as
they
went
boone
watched
them
long
enough
to
see
that
they
picked
up
in
his
belt
and
fitted
his
wiping
stick
to
his
rifle
he
and
boone
walked
ahead
to
the
indian
who
lay
still
in
the
grass
summers
stooped
over
his
knife
cut
into
the
scalp
and
made
a
rough
circle
from
which
the
blood
beaded
he
got
hold
of
the
indian
s
short
hair
and
tore
the
circle
loose
leaving
the
piece
of
skull
naked
and
raw
take
his
gun
this
injun
s
had
a
grief
lately
some
of
his
kin
s
gone
under
a
brother
maybe
that
s
why
he
chopped
his
tails
off
looks
recent
do
nt
it
like
as
not
it
just
happened
that
s
why
they
was
so
froze
for
our
scalps
so
s
they
would
nt
have
to
go
home
beaten
and
with
nary
thing
to
shine
with
he
went
back
and
picked
up
his
bundle
of
meat
carrying
scalp
and
bundle
in
one
hand
the
mandan
pulled
in
so
close
they
could
hop
aboard
jourdonnais
bold
dark
face
questioned
their
eyes
big
and
watchful
like
the
eyes
of
a
frog
ready
to
jump
if
a
man
took
another
step
summers
said
we
put
one
under
and
winged
two
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
swung
toward
boone
there
s
a
hoss
as
ll
shoot
plumb
center
in
tones
that
boone
barely
overheard
he
went
on
we
ai
nt
seen
the
last
of
em
i
m
thinkin
pummers
was
right
but
for
a
day
and
part
of
another
while
they
went
by
the
riviere
a
jacques
and
headed
on
toward
the
l
eau
qui
court
jourdonnais
told
himself
that
he
was
nt
there
was
nt
one
sign
of
indian
not
even
to
summers
who
watched
the
shores
hour
after
hour
searching
with
his
trained
gray
eye
summers
face
was
sober
but
not
worried
jourdonnais
wondered
if
he
ever
worried
this
big
loose
built
man
who
was
like
a
wise
old
dog
watching
him
gazing
down
from
his
place
at
the
steering
oar
jourdonnais
wondered
nt
care
for
money
or
a
nice
house
or
pretties
for
a
wife
if
he
had
one
he
lived
like
a
wild
thing
to
eat
and
frolic
and
keep
his
scalp
not
thinking
from
one
day
to
another
not
putting
by
against
the
future
if
jourdonnais
had
nt
found
him
fresh
back
from
go
when
he
fell
abel
dragged
him
back
into
the
bow
night
came
on
the
half
moon
rose
and
cast
light
scantily
over
the
sea
the
face
of
the
moon
beamed
when
the
sky
became
black
the
moon
glowed
the
westerly
swell
had
lengthened
now
the
light
coldly
glancing
off
the
moon
glanced
along
the
swell
and
made
a
saffron
moonglade
down
this
he
sailed
his
dory
adorned
by
spikes
of
gold
and
his
sail
a
cloth
of
silver
stars
came
out
and
burned
blue
in
the
black
abel
sought
the
pole
star
mumbled
some
words
to
it
and
steered
on
lesser
stars
came
out
in
the
west
all
of
these
shone
clearly
and
all
save
one
were
delicately
hued
by
emerald
light
as
if
the
bonny
forests
yonder
were
of
these
beamers
was
not
a
star
it
was
a
light
flashing
at
short
intervals
it
had
the
hue
of
a
candle
flame
this
difference
escaped
abel
s
eye
because
it
required
a
gaze
too
fine
and
steady
for
him
to
make
he
could
nt
keep
his
head
up
that
long
nevertheless
he
seemed
disturbed
by
that
changing
light
at
times
he
squinted
in
that
direction
and
mumbled
his
failure
to
make
something
of
it
angered
him
he
brushed
his
sleeve
against
the
frozen
lather
of
his
mouth
he
tried
the
words
again
at
last
he
said
them
i
should
like
to
know
and
more
passionately
you
you
the
first
sentence
had
been
uttered
in
a
calm
fashion
the
words
that
followed
expressed
yearning
tenderness
they
were
said
in
a
sighing
way
vapor
swept
the
horizon
from
north
to
west
all
the
stars
vanished
at
once
a
moaning
began
in
the
region
where
the
light
had
flashed
a
terrible
down
like
a
man
moaning
in
anguish
of
frost
and
thinned
to
a
crescendo
a
prolonged
walpurgis
syllable
fit
to
summon
the
condemned
once
again
abel
s
senses
failed
him
he
believed
this
moan
came
from
stephen
s
mouth
he
made
his
way
forward
and
heaved
him
to
his
feet
stephen
fell
and
groaned
ice
crackled
in
the
folds
of
his
oilskins
abel
struck
him
gently
on
the
face
and
heavily
on
shoulders
and
thighs
stephen
groaned
he
flung
up
his
hands
abel
seized
them
and
worked
them
back
and
forth
he
dragged
him
down
to
the
forward
thwart
and
turned
him
over
so
that
he
crouched
on
hands
and
knees
he
kicked
him
on
the
behind
this
started
stephen
crawling
forward
he
had
life
in
him
and
some
heat
he
had
wit
enough
to
seek
his
shelter
this
pleased
abel
he
grunted
standing
over
his
brother
he
again
heard
the
moaning
of
the
sable
island
sirens
he
could
see
that
stephen
struggled
in
silence
up
the
steering
oar
soon
after
the
vapor
had
gone
away
the
signals
in
the
west
ceased
the
stars
shone
again
the
wind
stayed
fair
for
him
once
more
he
slept
or
seemed
to
sleep
slouched
against
the
oar
one
arm
crooked
around
the
handle
he
plied
his
trade
in
long
unbroken
rollings
the
swell
lifted
him
into
the
company
of
stars
then
drew
him
down
into
blackness
so
he
sailed
until
moon
set
until
rise
of
morning
star
which
came
in
peaceful
glory
harbinger
of
blue
peaceful
days
all
other
stars
were
dimmed
by
the
vermilion
whirl
of
the
day
star
yet
far
down
only
the
morning
star
increased
in
beauty
great
venus
borrowing
before
all
others
the
sun
fire
casting
it
aloft
and
abroad
and
to
the
westward
whither
he
must
go
he
witnessed
the
change
and
understood
awkwardly
and
in
pain
he
twisted
his
body
toward
her
stared
under
lowered
lids
he
beheld
her
the
single
heavenly
black
he
gave
her
a
nod
he
held
up
his
compass
and
caught
her
rays
therein
her
beauty
gave
him
new
life
because
the
revelation
of
the
needle
made
him
howl
harshly
he
howled
and
stephen
answered
by
a
moan
abel
shouted
to
the
sky
his
slobbered
face
distorted
in
all
that
beauty
and
befouling
it
on
the
flower
yet
t
was
nothing
he
had
steered
north
a
space
not
long
his
excitement
could
hardly
be
real
no
it
was
a
shrewdness
by
his
inner
self
provoking
a
sound
thought
an
appeal
to
his
seamanship
which
in
turn
should
cause
a
bold
affirmative
action
grumbling
he
trimmed
her
shifted
his
oar
and
laid
her
on
the
old
course
he
examined
the
compass
again
ah
a
vessel
of
some
sort
appeared
directly
north
of
the
dory
she
could
not
be
made
out
at
all
that
is
her
hull
and
masts
were
out
of
sight
either
she
gave
off
a
constant
and
icy
flashing
now
there
were
a
thousand
glints
and
gleams
on
the
ocean
there
all
of
these
had
the
unsubstantial
quality
of
tiderips
and
spray
a
man
would
nt
give
them
much
of
his
attention
that
constant
flash
had
more
to
it
a
depth
which
proved
that
it
came
off
wood
moreover
it
advanced
and
in
one
direction
northwest
had
abel
stayed
on
his
mistaken
course
he
might
have
steered
to
leeward
of
the
stranger
and
thus
missed
her
as
it
was
both
of
them
were
steering
on
courses
that
might
bring
them
close
to
each
other
the
sun
came
up
and
flung
a
shower
of
mild
light
across
the
world
this
served
to
change
the
quality
of
the
stranger
s
flashing
indeed
the
glare
came
so
brightly
that
it
seemed
like
signals
off
a
glass
to
abel
a
long
flash
a
short
one
two
long
ones
what
then
an
inquiry
do
you
require
assistance
what
vessel
is
nt
the
stranger
s
story
a
feeble
glance
which
was
all
that
abel
had
to
give
might
have
been
thus
deceived
the
flashes
were
meaningless
when
watched
for
even
a
minute
except
for
this
one
fact
now
certain
that
a
craft
lay
there
and
on
a
course
directed
by
human
hands
whose
hands
hard
to
say
at
that
remove
the
space
between
the
two
craft
lessened
at
a
damned
business
it
s
just
nature
am
i
right
and
if
it
s
just
nature
and
just
a
personal
matter
who
are
they
to
interfere
let
me
tell
you
a
thing
if
you
got
yourself
up
one
night
and
had
an
inspiration
and
went
into
eunie
s
room
and
give
her
a
couple
of
pokes
you
d
be
doing
her
a
favor
i
do
nt
care
how
tight
she
goes
around
looking
you
re
a
man
got
a
good
education
you
tell
me
am
i
wrong
no
of
course
you
re
not
wrong
nt
know
about
eunice
so
there
you
are
just
like
i
said
and
mark
my
words
the
day
will
come
when
people
going
to
get
some
sense
that
s
my
way
of
thinking
about
it
duck
turned
full
to
laskell
and
said
and
i
want
to
tell
you
another
thing
mr
laskell
he
paused
to
arouse
curiosity
about
the
other
thing
he
was
going
to
tell
he
stood
with
his
mouth
poised
to
speak
then
he
said
you
may
think
i
got
a
low
mind
but
i
ai
nt
talking
like
a
young
kid
that
wants
his
first
piece
and
ca
nt
wait
till
he
gets
it
i
mean
to
say
there
s
just
so
many
apples
on
a
tree
a
man
s
got
just
so
much
in
him
and
no
more
and
believe
me
i
did
nt
spare
none
of
mine
maybe
you
know
how
that
is
guess
maybe
i
m
older
than
you
but
maybe
you
live
the
same
way
not
sparing
yourself
what
you
got
you
got
and
what
you
lose
you
do
nt
get
back
and
duck
opened
his
mouth
and
pointed
to
the
gap
in
his
upper
teeth
even
if
i
got
me
some
store
teeth
they
might
look
good
but
they
would
nt
be
my
teeth
what
s
gone
is
gone
well
anyway
what
i
was
saying
what
you
lose
you
lose
so
i
m
talking
from
my
head
duck
covered
his
brow
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
it
comes
from
here
he
said
and
not
from
you
know
where
and
duck
clutched
you
know
where
so
it
ai
nt
a
crazy
hot
idea
he
concluded
then
he
added
yet
still
and
he
grinned
yet
still
i
d
like
to
have
me
a
poke
at
that
eunie
folger
they
left
the
gorge
and
cut
a
wide
circle
and
came
to
the
stream
again
it
was
strong
and
rapid
even
now
in
august
but
it
can
follow
up
from
here
easy
enough
duck
said
and
when
you
want
to
find
your
way
back
you
ll
see
where
it
cuts
in
close
to
the
road
and
that
s
only
a
mile
on
the
road
from
the
folgers
house
pand
he
stood
there
while
laskell
jointed
his
rod
fixed
on
the
reel
threaded
the
line
through
the
guides
and
tied
on
the
leader
the
fly
that
laskell
chose
was
a
coachman
it
was
not
a
rational
choice
but
he
could
not
under
duck
s
eye
stop
to
study
the
stream
as
kermit
simpson
had
taught
him
to
do
when
he
was
ready
duck
said
well
good
luck
then
he
said
you
one
of
those
fishermen
takes
a
flask
with
him
i
m
sorry
i
did
nt
bring
one
i
just
thought
duck
said
he
went
away
but
he
left
his
void
behind
him
left
it
with
laskell
and
in
him
his
laskell
might
think
it
it
was
simply
void
it
was
nothing
the
pure
will
of
nothingness
or
it
was
the
nothingness
of
pure
will
it
was
not
wickedness
it
was
emptiness
masking
itself
as
mind
and
desire
laskell
thought
of
the
wan
white
eunice
folger
of
duck
s
speculations
and
of
emily
duck
s
wife
whose
relation
with
this
man
he
laskell
had
but
a
few
minutes
before
made
to
count
for
so
much
to
his
credit
and
he
thought
of
mrs
folger
and
nancy
and
of
their
poor
misplaced
confidence
in
duck
s
manliness
and
of
his
own
misplaced
confidence
in
their
female
judgment
it
was
perhaps
funny
that
he
had
no
sooner
decided
to
accept
their
estimate
of
duck
s
masculinity
than
duck
himself
had
been
to
such
pains
to
set
him
straight
but
laskell
felt
no
impulse
to
laugh
lack
of
practice
made
him
awkward
with
his
casting
he
dutifully
reminded
himself
of
all
the
things
he
must
think
about
arm
close
to
the
body
wrist
loose
he
did
not
believe
that
it
made
any
difference
he
did
not
really
believe
that
there
were
fish
in
the
stream
or
that
he
could
catch
them
or
that
fish
had
ever
been
caught
by
this
method
you
equipped
yourself
expensively
you
learned
the
technique
you
did
everything
the
way
you
had
been
taught
and
even
for
the
deceptive
pleasure
of
it
you
debated
the
theory
of
flies
with
other
fishermen
arguing
about
just
what
it
was
that
the
fish
saw
when
the
fly
floated
over
its
head
but
nothing
really
happened
or
whatever
happened
happened
for
quite
other
reasons
and
not
because
you
did
what
you
did
he
moved
slowly
upstream
unsure
of
his
footing
his
thighs
were
tired
and
he
moved
more
carefully
than
the
current
required
he
did
not
like
the
way
he
moved
he
was
not
being
wary
but
nervous
but
the
stream
began
to
do
some
of
its
work
on
laskell
the
morning
mist
cleared
away
and
the
air
freshened
the
sun
came
through
the
overhang
of
hole
and
then
vanish
into
it
a
kingfisher
worked
the
stream
ahead
of
him
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
as
blue
and
direct
as
lightning
his
blood
began
to
pick
up
a
little
with
the
exercise
some
sense
of
possibility
returned
to
him
he
began
to
like
being
alone
he
forgot
about
duck
forgot
about
mrs
folger
s
estimate
of
duck
and
nancy
s
and
his
own
and
how
they
had
just
been
contradicted
by
duck
s
own
statement
he
forgot
about
everything
except
himself
and
then
he
forgot
discover
represented
two
very
different
types
of
navy
mustang
the
differences
between
them
were
largely
characteristic
in
exaggerated
fashion
of
the
great
cleavage
between
the
bridge
and
the
engine
room
on
the
bridge
in
an
atmosphere
of
clear
skies
and
blue
waves
of
flag
officers
pacing
to
and
fro
there
is
a
consciousness
of
centralized
control
and
a
tremendous
emphasis
on
appearance
it
is
a
world
of
sharp
commands
and
quick
maneuvers
where
speed
means
more
wind
in
your
face
and
causes
more
rippling
of
the
many
colored
signal
flags
that
soar
up
to
the
yardarm
and
fall
away
with
such
grace
and
the
rudder
is
something
far
below
that
at
a
touch
of
the
hand
swerves
the
big
ship
in
column
with
her
sisters
but
in
the
engine
room
these
concepts
are
associated
with
sweat
and
heat
and
the
hard
working
machinist
s
mates
who
labor
on
the
throttles
to
produce
the
outward
show
are
more
constantly
in
juxtaposition
with
the
caverns
of
ugliness
that
in
most
things
sustain
the
fragile
and
beautiful
exterior
of
life
bill
ellis
had
joined
the
navy
at
seventeen
and
until
the
war
he
had
always
been
in
the
bridge
gang
of
capital
ships
attaining
at
last
the
smug
elevation
of
chief
quartermaster
he
had
been
handsome
almost
dashing
as
a
boy
one
need
not
linger
on
the
details
of
his
introduction
in
full
innocence
to
the
routine
naval
liberty
in
tropical
ports
perhaps
if
he
had
had
a
family
atmosphere
behind
him
or
even
some
slight
extra
naval
interest
intellectual
or
otherwise
with
which
to
combat
these
impressions
he
might
have
been
rescued
but
as
it
was
he
embraced
the
life
of
bars
and
brothels
without
the
slightest
hesitation
and
as
every
man
must
have
some
pattern
in
his
life
some
sort
of
skeleton
to
hang
his
varying
impulses
and
excursions
to
if
his
personality
is
not
to
degenerate
to
that
of
a
tramp

and
more

a

was
more
intent
with

on
the

halyards
or
cried

gymnastic

small
wonder
that
when
so
many
enlisted
men
were
raised
to
temporary
commissioned
rank
to
meet
the
war
s
increased
needs
ellis
should
have
been
recommended
by
no
less
than
a
vice
admiral
he
knew
his
navy
at
least
he
knew
the
bridge
life
was
a
simple
matter
on
shore
it
was
a
succession
of
bars
where
girls
could
be
picked
up
at
sea
it
was
a
series
of
deftly
executed
signals
and
carefully
checked
chronometers
his
health
record
dotted
as
it
was
with
venereal
entries
contrasted
curiously
with
the
neatly
entered
commendations
in
his
service
jacket
it
was
easy
to
see
why
he
made
a
poor
officer
he
lacked
the
remotest
understanding
of
the
why
in
life
or
even
in
the
navy
and
stripped
of
the
snap
and
polish
of
the
peacetime
battleship
he
found
on
the
small
patrol
craft
to
which
he
was
now
assigned
only
a
constant
reminder
of
how
nice
things
had
been
when
they
were
done
right
this
added
to
the
panic
which
he
felt
when
he
began
to
ship
produced
a
temper
almost
permanently
bad
which
in
turn
resulted
in
the
type
of
absurd
reaction
that
in
a
crisis
say
an
imminent
collision
would
make
him
suddenly
turn
to
a
signalman
on
the
bridge
and
yell
do
nt
you
know
you
ca
nt
wear
white
socks
up
here
and
then
the
crisis
averted
through
the
quick
thinking
of
his
officer
of
the
deck
he
would
rush
below
to
his
cabin
and
in
the
neat
distinguished
hand
that
had
been
molded
by
his
old
navy
log
writing
produce
memorandum
after
memorandum
on
the
wearing
of
the
correct
uniform
of
the
day
his
moods
lifted
and
fell
with
remarkable
speed
and
variability
and
his
junior
officers
never
knew
what
to
expect
or
where
to
expect
it
with
them
he
was
utterly
at
a
loss
and
he
alternated
between
giving
them
complete
authority
and
treating
them
with
the
contempt
that
he
had
meted
out
in
former
days
to
signalman
strikers
on
the
colorado
yet
rather
pathetically
he
liked
them
all
wrote
them
excellent
fitness
reports
smiled
when
he
smiled
and
said
nothing
when
he
growled
but
all
the
while
he
was
uncomfortably
conscious
of
the
unanimous
dislike
in
which
his
uncontrollable
temper
quite
aside
from
the
social
barrier
inevitably
present
between
the
college
graduate
reserve
and
the
mustang
had
caused
him
to
be
held
he
was
fairly
congenial
with
foster
but
the
latter
at
heart
hated
him
for
his
failure
to
understand
machinery
and
his
drafting
of
machinist
s
mates
from
necessary
engine
room
duty
to
assist
deck
hands
in
the
constant
painting
and
cleaning
of
the
ship
which
ellis
battleship
background
made
him
emphasize
at
the
expense
of
drills
instruction
and
even
vital
repairs

a
realist
he
had
started
life
from
an
even
lower
rung
than
ellis
having
been
the
son
of
a
poor
maine
farmer
he
had
never
been
the
spoiled
darling
of
the
quarterdeck
his
life
in
the
navy
had
been
a
long
and
arduous
experience
in
boiler
rooms
in
engine
rooms
amid
throttles
and
generators
listening
always
to
the
deafening
hum
of
spinning

there
had
been
no

arriving
at
this
incredible
altitude
of
commissioned
rank
only
after
one
year
of
war

the
age

forty
when
he
was
ten

older

some

chapter
viiivalerie
went
to
bed
in
such
a
confused
state
of
mind
that
the
only
impression
she
got
of
her
bedroom
was
of
its
terrifying
grandeur
she
roused
next
morning
when
the
first
light
of
dawn
came
through
the
windows
wide
awake
at
once
she
was
gratefully
conscious
of
the
softness
of
the
bed
on
which
she
lay
she
gave
a
low
exclamation
of
wonder
over
the
coverlet
which
was
embroidered
in
blue
and
gold
with
a
most
curious
device
the
heart
and
shell
which
as
she
learned
later
was
the
coeur
insigne
and
immediately
under
the
canopy
a
shelf
for
books
and
attached
to
the
shelf
a
bag
tilled
with
aromatic
herbs
there
was
a
candlestick
on
a
table
and
it
was
at
least
two
feet
high
and
as
big
around
as
her
wrist
she
lay
perfectly
still
for
several
minutes
thinking
of
what
had
happened
the
day
before
and
wondering
what
plans
were
hatching
in
the
mind
of
the
owner
of
this
huge
stone
building
what
a
strange
man
she
said
to
herself
his
eyes
seem
to
burn
i
know
he
s
kind
in
spite
of
all
his
sharpness
and
the
way
he
hurries
how
i
wish
i
knew
what
he
has
in
mind
to
do
with
me
she
was
certain
of
one
thing
that
all
this
mystery
had
to
do
with
the
problem
of
her
parentage
jacques
coeur
had
known
at
first
glance
who
she
resembled
and
had
assisted
the
sire
d
arlay
to
the
same
knowledge
what
else
could
it
mean
today
she
said
aloud
sitting
up
in
bed
and
i
am
her
thoughts
went
from
there
to
the
sire
d
arlay
and
became
firmly
anchored
this
second
encounter
with
him
had
confirmed
the
impressions
he
had
carried
away
from
the
first
he
was
not
handsome
and
he
had
none
of
the
airs
and
affected
manners
she
associated
with
highest
gentility
hut
in
spite
of
that
she
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
was
a
great
gentleman
he
was
showing
himself
just
as
kind
as
he
had
during
that
long
evening
when
they
labored
together
at
the
fashioning
of
the
coffin
and
she
had
confided
to
him
so
much
about
herself
she
thought
with
a
surge
of
pride
he
likes
me
it
was
gratifying
and
exciting
to
know
that
he
liked
her
even
though
she
had
made
no
serious
effort
to
define
for
herself
how
she
left
about
him
her
thoughts
came
back
to
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
this
room
she
studied
the
prie
dieu
against
one
wall
it
was
tall
and
had
panels
of
red
needlepoint
there
was
a
bench
piled
up
luxuriantly
with
a
crucifix
with
so
much
compassion
depicted
on
the
face
that
her
own
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
measured
the
width
of
the
bed
with
an
incredulous
eye
and
decided
that
as
many
as
five
people
could
sleep
in
it
how
fine
to
have
it
all
to
oneself
and
be
able
to
stretch
right
out
she
had
always
been
cramped
as
to
sleeping
space
in
the
maret
tent
and
in
malodorous
rooms
in
taverns
in
fact
there
had
been
for
her
something
mean
and
furtive
the
moneyman
the
moneyman
about
slumber
a
need
to
dress
and
undress
hurriedly
and
under
a
certain
constant
inspection
she
threw
back
the
covers
and
set
herself
to
test
the
width
by
rolling
across
the
bed
she
accomplished
six
revolutions
safely
but
the
seventh
projected
her
over
the
side
she
landed
on
the
floor
with
a
loud
thump
she
was
on
the
point
of
raising
herself
rather
ruefully
when
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
a
pair
of
shoes
beside
a
chair
they
were
unbelievably
lovely
the
leather
was
and
the
first
foliage
on
the
trees
the
tops
were
turned
back
to
reveal
an
inside
lining
of
soft
white
material
the
greatest
glory
of
these
amazing
shoes
however
was
the
presence
of
a
bow
of
yellow
velvet
on
the
instep
of
each
she
lay
still
and
looked
at
them
not
fully
trusting
the
evidence
of
her
eyes
something
was
wrong
she
had
put
her
clothes
the
night
before
on
this
particular
chair
and
had
deposited
her
own
shoes
beside
it
thinking
at
the
time
how
out
of
place
they
looked
what
had
happened
slowly
she
raised
her
eyes
finding
further
food
for
surprise
at
each
stage
of
the
elevation
the
chair
was
covered
with
clothes
but
not
the
old
and
somewhat
bedraggled
objects
she
had
left
there
before
getting
into
bed
all
her
own
clothing
was
gone
and
in
its
stead
was
a
complete
new
outfit
she
sprang
i
m
sure
glad
for
your
father
s
sake
that
you
re
looking
so
well
and
elegant
she
d
been
estimating
the
cost
of
joy
s
outfit
to
tell
harold
bowers
about
it
where
do
they
come
from
what
have
i
to
do
with
them
why
should
they
be
here
why
should
what
is
the
use
of
even
thinking
such
thoughts
today
what
i
let
them
go
they
trudged
across
the
rugs
of
the
other
room
the
door
closed
joy
stood
there
looking
suddenly
smallish
and
forlorn
her
eyes
were
on
her
mother
you
do
nt
look
awfully
well
mama
i
had
a
headache
this
morning
it
got
some
better
now
it
s
worse
again
all
this
talk
oh
me
oh
my
what
s
the
use
of
it
all
if
you
do
nt
mind
joy
i
think
i
ll
go
and
do
nt
mind
joy
said
in
a
toneless
voice
elizabeth
went
out
and
joy
still
standing
looked
slowly
around
she
looked
at
a
chair
as
if
it
were
a
strange
object
i
saw
her
dig
her
nails
into
her
palms
i
knew
how
she
felt
god
i
knew
and
maybe
now
would
have
been
the
time
to
have
it
out
all
all
to
face
it
with
joy
i
knew
i
would
nt
i
knew
i
could
nt
i
knew
it
would
all
no
longer
be
true
today
talk
today
of
pains
i
felt
years
ago
as
if
they
were
present
as
though
anything
could
be
done
might
as
well
discuss
the
rheumatism
of
a
man
that
s
been
in
his
grave
for
years
just
as
sensible
and
useful
so
i
smiled
a
kind
of
a
used
up
smile
and
said
poor
mother
yes
joy
answered
only
half
listening
not
the
circumstances
kind
of
dreamily
joy
said
i
suppose
so
then
she
seemed
to
rouse
herself
what
do
you
mean
exactly
well
she
does
nt
really
grasp
anything
i
said
still
she
was
so
glad
you
were
coming
she
telephoned
gertie
maybe
that
was
a
mistake
but
it
just
goes
to
show
what
she
tried
to
hold
me
call
me
to
accounting
with
her
eyes
so
i
laughed
and
said
that
her
heart
s
in
the
right
place
sit
down
joy
i
do
nt
seem
to
be
able
to
joy
said
all
the
homelessness
comes
over
me
again
that
cut
though
the
old
edge
is
dull
enough
ha
home
i
ve
brooded
on
that
home
oh
i
know
i
ve
known
for
long
home
is
a
place
where
two
people
two
keep
all
their
treasures
because
each
wings
are
broken
and
the
other
is
the
keeper
of
the
cage
and
rejoices
at
each
gradual
breaking
of
the
wing
i
m
an
expert
i
guess
on
the
meaning
of
home
but
i
wo
nt
discuss
the
problems
of
flight
today
talk
to
a
man
with
spinal
paralysis
of
doing
track
stunts
funny
ghastly
i
played
the
old
game
why
joy
what
do
you
mean
here
we
are
again
as
we
used
to
be
dad
i
still
do
nt
see
you
pretending
that
you
and
i
understand
each
other
and
somehow
have
a
common
point
of
view
has
nt
that
always
been
the
case
i
asked
i
have
believed
that
i
did
nt
want
to
be
robbed
of
that
too
but
joy
was
clearer
and
more
insistent
in
her
clarity
than
ever
i
might
have
known
at
that
moment
what
came
out
a
bit
later
and
the
minute
fact
on
which
i
could
lean
you
subtly
got
out
from
under
and
became
my
enemy
i
know
i
got
palish
never
been
able
to
control
that
how
can
you
say
a
thing
like
that
her
voice
was
sad
yet
it
was
triumphant
too
strange
reminded
me
of
birds
suddenly
rising
in
a
field
thrushes
meadow
larks
because
it
s
so
because
it
s
so
terribly
true
you
lured
me
on
and
then
deserted
me
oh
not
knowingly
not
maliciously
but
you
did
over
and
over
again
and
that
with
mother
being
what
she
is
made
me
feel
homeless
here
homeless
in
the
world
homeless
in
the
universe
yes
yes
yes
i
can
see
it
but
would
it
have
made
her
feel
less
homeless
to
have
a
full
view
of
my
own
homelessness
my
nakedness
to
all
the
winds
like
my
pines
like
my
wild
storm
contorted
show
that
not
to
joy
not
topi
d
gone
crazy
the
irony
ha
blandly
the
child
puts
my
whole
misery
in
a
nutshell
as
if
i
did
nt
know
as
if
i
had
nt
been
punished
for
not
acting
according
to
that
knowledge
for
thirty
years
thirty
years
go
on
telling
me
i
thought
go
on
trying
to
rip
the
grave
clothes
off
they
re
strong
all
right
so
i
said
what
do
i
mean
then
maybe
you
know
you
mean
slicker
compromises
with
all
that
irks
and
degrades
the
cultivation
of
a
thicker
skin
you
do
nt
mean
exercising
your
own
moral
judgment
and
telling
all
that
falsifies
and
trivializes
your
life
to
go
to
i
ought
to
be
so
damned
grateful
that
elizabeth
came
in
just
then
with
her
hair
half
down
with
her
eyes
half
sleepy
and
half
alarmed
otherwise
i
might
have
spoken
out
at
last
has
missed
the
supreme
moment
of
his
free
choice
and
been
a
coward
and
a
slave
at
that
moment
he
s
finished
he
ca
nt
step
out
into
nothingness
emptiness
and
leave
his
murdered
murdered
then
to
no
purpose
even
behind
him
yes
i
might
have
and
the
more
fool
i
thank
heavens
for
elizabeth
she
said
are
you
two
quarreling
you
woke
me
up
way
upstairs
shouting
so
we
had
nt
been
shouting
a
bit
in
fact
but
elizabeth
has
fine
ears
no
mama
joy
said
calmly
it
s
just
a
discussion
i
did
nt
realize
we
were
raising
our
voices
of
course
not
mother
i
reassured
her
you
can
go
back
to
rest
if
you
want
to
this
would
nt
even
interest
you
i
did
in
a
harsh
almost
savage
voice
well
and
he
had
nt
put
on
his
shoes
nor
even
picked
up
the
dangling
galluses
and
he
did
nt
seem
to
have
heard
miss
habersham
at
all
just
standing
looming
bulging
in
the
door
looking
at
miss
habersham
not
at
the
hat
not
at
her
eyes
nor
even
look
at
a
string
of
letters
in
russian
or
chinese
which
someone
you
believed
had
just
told
you
spelled
your
name
saying
at
last
in
a
musing
baffled
voice
no
then
turning
his
head
to
look
at
him
and
saying
it
ai
nt
you
neither
then
turning
his
head
further
until
he
was
looking
at
aleck
sander
while
aleck
sander
slid
his
eyes
up
at
the
sheriff
then
slid
them
away
again
then
slid
them
up
again
you
the
sheriff
said
you
re
the
one
you
went
out
there
in
the
dark
and
helped
dig
up
a
dead
man
not
only
that
a
dead
white
man
that
the
rest
of
the
white
folks
claimed
another
nigger
had
murdered
why
was
it
because
miss
habersham
made
you
never
nobody
made
me
aleck
sander
said
i
did
nt
even
know
i
was
going
i
had
done
already
told
chick
i
did
nt
aim
to
only
when
we
got
to
the
truck
everybody
seemed
to
just
take
it
for
granted
i
was
i
knowed
it
i
was
nt
mr
hampton
miss
habersham
said
now
the
sheriff
looked
at
her
he
even
heard
her
now
have
nt
you
finished
slicing
that
meat
yet
he
said
give
me
the
knife
then
he
took
her
by
the
arm
turning
her
back
to
the
table
flint
you
done
enough
rushing
and
stewing
around
tonight
to
last
you
a
while
it
ll
be
daylight
in
fifteen
minutes
and
folks
do
nt
start
lynchings
in
daylight
they
might
finish
one
by
daylight
if
they
had
a
little
trouble
or
bad
luck
and
got
behind
with
it
but
they
do
nt
start
them
by
daylight
because
then
they
would
have
to
see
one
another
s
faces
how
many
can
eat
more
than
two
eggs
they
left
aleck
sander
with
his
breakfast
at
the
kitchen
table
and
carried
theirs
into
the
diningroom
he
and
his
uncle
and
miss
habersham
carrying
the
platter
of
fried
eggs
and
meat
and
the
pan
of
biscuits
baked
last
night
and
warmed
again
in
the
oven
until
they
unstrained
grounds
and
the
water
had
been
boiling
together
until
the
sheriff
had
thought
to
remove
the
pot
from
the
hot
part
of
the
stove
four
of
them
although
the
sheriff
had
set
five
places
and
they
had
barely
sat
down
when
the
sheriff
raised
his
head
listening
though
he
himself
heard
nothing
then
rose
and
went
into
the
dark
hall
and
toward
the
rear
of
the
house
and
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
back
door
and
presently
the
sheriff
came
back
with
will
legate
though
minus
the
shotgun
and
he
turned
his
head
enough
to
look
out
the
window
behind
him
and
sure
enough
it
was
daylight
the
sheriff
served
the
plates
while
his
uncle
and
legate
passed
theirs
and
the
sheriff
s
cup
to
miss
habersham
at
the
coffeepot
then
at
once
he
seemed
to
have
been
hearing
for
a
long
time
the
sheriff
from
a
great
distance
saying
boy
boy
then
wake
hint
up
gavin
let
him
eat
his
breakfast
before
he
goes
to
sleep
and
he
jerked
it
was
into
the
same
cup
and
he
began
to
eat
chewing
and
even
swallowing
rising
and
falling
as
though
to
the
motion
of
the
chewing
along
the
deep
soft
bottomless
mire
of
sleep
into
then
out
of
the
voices
buzzing
of
old
finished
things
no
longer
concern
of
his
the
sheriff
s
do
you
know
jake
montgomery
from
over
in
crossman
county
been
in
and
out
of
town
here
for
the
last
six
months
or
so
then
legate
s
sure
a
kind
of
jackleg
timber
buyer
now
used
to
run
a
place
he
called
a
restaurant
just
across
the
tennessee
line
out
of
memphis
though
i
never
heard
of
nobody
trying
to
buy
nothing
that
had
to
be
chewed
in
it
until
a
man
went
and
got
killed
in
it
one
night
two
three
years
ago
they
never
did
know
just
how
much
jake
did
or
did
nt
have
to
do
with
it
but
the
tennessee
police
run
him
back
across
the
mississippi
line
just
on
principle
since
then
i
reckon
he
s
been
laying
around
his
pa
s
farm
over
beyond
have
forgot
about
that
other
business
and
he
can
set
up
again
in
another
place
on
a
highway
with
a
hole
under
the
floor
big
enough
to
hide
a
case
of
whiskey
in
what
was
he
doing
around
here
the
sheriff
said
then
legate
buying
timber
ai
nt
he
ai
nt
him
and
vinson
gowrie
then
legate
said
with
the
barest
inflection
was
and
then
with
no
inflection
at
all
what
is
he
doing
and
he
this
time
his
own
voice
indifferent
along
the
soft
deep
edge
of
sleep
too
indifferent
to
bother
if
it
were
aloud
or
not
he
ai
nt
doing
anything
now
but
it
was
better
afterward
out
of
the
stale
warm
house
again
into
the
air
the
morning
the
sun
in
one
soft
high
level
golden
wash
in
the
highest
tips
of
the
trees
gilding
the
motionless
obese
uprush
of
the
town
water
tank
in
spiderlegged
elongate
against
the
blue
the
four
of
them
in
his
uncle
s
car
once
more
while
the
sheriff
even
to
a
bright
orange
and
yellow
necktie
saying
to
his
uncle
you
run
miss
eunice
home
so
she
can
get
some
sleep
i
ll
pick
you
up
at
your
house
in
say
an
hour
miss
habersham
in
the
front
seat
with
his
uncle
said
pah
that
was
all
she
did
nt
curse
she
did
nt
need
to
it
was
far
more
definite
and
final
than
just
cursing
she
leaned
forward
to
look
past
his
uncle
at
the
sheriff
a
moment
through
the
light
below
the
royal
cushions
his
adam
s
apple
throbbed
his
tongue
kept
darting
like
a
lizard
s
finally
he
slipped
into
a
corner
and
disappeared
from
sight
now
the
women
strode
forth
the
drums
grew
more
sonorous
their
long
silky
bodies
began
to
sway
like
fascinated
cobras
a
permeating
scent
of
ripe
mangoes
filled
the
air
the
king
tapped
me
lightly
on
the
shoulder
his
eyes
were
gleaming
yes
my
friend
i
too
was
young
once
long
very
long
ago
i
was
the
finest
dancer
in
the
tribe
and
the
finest
lover
i
made
love
he
murmured
nostalgically
seven
times
a
day
and
later
five
i
was
famous
throughout
the
congo
yes
and
not
only
for
the
frequency
for
the
skill
as
well
and
for
the
fantasy
he
closed
his
eyes
with
the
grief
of
ancient
memories
and
now
all
is
over
youth
vanishes
strength
fades
only
the
skill
remains
and
the
patience
of
course
once
a
day
is
sufficient
now
my
fame
has
died
throughout
the
congo
soon
i
ll
be
forgotten
the
drums
rolled
on
pierced
by
the
rippling
of
a
flute
in
the
distance
strange
noises
seemed
to
be
rising
from
the
brush
an
orchestral
accompaniment
of
rustlings
and
barkings
squeals
and
ululations
the
whole
jungle
was
joining
in
the
balbongi
women
swayed
their
hips
and
ground
their
shimmering
thighs
the
men
rose
out
of
the
shadows
and
crept
up
behind
them
with
their
furry
and
feathery
and
scaly
masks
they
looked
like
beasts
of
prey
silently
stalking
their
victims
the
women
closed
their
eyes
in
a
frenzy
of
abandonment
the
trumpets
emerged
the
loincloths
were
dropped
the
stench
of
perspiration
spread
one
of
the
women
leapt
into
the
center
and
a
buffalo
mask
rushed
forth
with
a
roar
drew
a
scimitar
from
its
crimson
sheath
flashed
it
about
then
pointed
it
rigidly
at
the
woman
s
body
she
gyrated
like
one
possessed
flinging
her
head
to
left
and
right
drawing
closer
and
closer
to
the
buffalo
spirit
leaning
back
further
and
further
till
her
long
black
head
almost
touched
the
ground
her
throat
and
belly
throbbed
with
the
pulse
of
her
breath
she
smiled
with
a
crucial
all
enveloping
resignation
as
the
scimitar
entered
her
sex
and
the
drops
of
blood
began
to
fall
cut
cut
the
balbongis
cried
as
the
scimitar
struck
again
and
again
cut
cut
they
all
cried
in
their
high
desolate
voices
then
the
woman
collapsed
and
was
carried
off
to
the
palace
the
dancers
continued
it
was
an
obscenity
not
merely
sexual
but
diabolical
in
intensity
their
muscles
grew
swollen
it
was
a
spiritual
crisis
far
more
than
a
physical
the
tribe
was
dying
before
our
eyes
this
was
their
desperate
last
appeal
the
final
tableau
of
their
impotence
the
king
looked
subdued
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
you
see
my
friend
even
in
this
there
is
something
sacred
something
exalted
it
looks
rather
profane
i
quite
agree
but
there
is
an
element
in
it
just
a
tiny
element
of
holiness
he
rose
and
nodded
good
night
to
us
and
trudged
lugubriously
toward
his
royal
bedchamber
and
then
the
dance
disintegrated
the
glitter
of
limbs
the
clash
of
drums
the
mounting
copulative
rhythm
and
at
last
a
great
silence
a
real
wilderness
of
silence
the
oil
lamps
began
to
splutter
and
go
out
one
by
one
an
intangible
horror
pervaded
the
mind
the
human
semblance
had
completely
vanished
lost
in
the
great
crevasse
of
superstition
all
fear
all
ritual
and
mutilation
their
sexual
core
lay
furiously
in
the
darkness
hawk
s
heads
crocodile
s
heads
hacking
away
at
the
prostrate
bodies
now
we
entered
a
great
billowing
valley
with
cliffs
rising
on
either
side
vertical
and
cavernous
like
gothic
facades
this
was
the
most
idyllic
place
we
had
seen
it
was
like
a
huge
park
wonderfully
cool
green
and
shadowy
yet
coruscating
with
colors
birds
butterflies
beetles
swarms
of
acacia
and
oleander
we
sat
down
under
a
low
dark
casuarina
tree
the
aroma
of
the
forest
rippled
about
us
the
air
was
filled
with
hints
of
the
past
lingering
rhythms
tantalizing
shadows
was
it
italy
or
provence
the
illusion
crumbled
all
around
us
we
heard
the
thin
dry
squeak
of
the
guinea
fowl
two
huge
turtles
lumbered
past
pausing
every
few
steps
craning
their
wrinkled
necks
in
a
kind
of
senile
indignation
herds
of
buck
and
boar
moved
through
the
neighboring
trees
indolent
utterly
indifferent
to
our
presence
later
after
we
had
filled
our
in
the
distance
once
there
was
a
sudden
vibration
in
the
air
brilliant
spools
of
green
and
gold
coiled
in
light
shot
through
the
boughs
they
hovered
then
darted
swift
as
the
light
itself
everyone
even
the
monkeys
grew
silent
and
watched
there
was
something
strangely
thrilling
in
this
electrical
apparition
which
vanished
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
hummingbirds
the
only
ones
i
ever
saw
in
the
african
wood
joshua
brought
us
our
cigarettes
one
for
each
of
the
men
two
for
balibobotee
oudange
began
to
pull
a
thorn
from
the
ball
of
his
foot
ndjoluva
and
osseladossa
drew
their
fingers
through
their
pubic
hair
it
seemed
they
had
picked
up
some
crab
lice
in
yalemba
bambo
with
his
pink
shirt
dangling
about
his
birdlike
legs
like
plumage
was
peering
at
joshua
s
butterflies
and
abulurubegan
to
tell
tales
in
his
low
mournful
voice
well
one
day
said
abuluru
with
a
poetical
air
an
old
woman
it
was
early
morning
and
her
daughter
s
husband
came
down
the
path
to
drink
at
the
well
he
knelt
down
beside
the
water
and
his
loin
cloth
slipped
to
the
ground
and
the
old
woman
marveled
at
his
shapeliness
and
vigor
she
felt
the
wicked
old
itch
of
desire
so
she
cast
a
spell
on
her
daughter
and
changed
her
to
a
wasp
and
that
night
she
slipped
softly
into
her
daughter
s
bed
the
men
listened
gravely
like
children
at
school
and
now
said
nimbalimba
the
one
about
the
buffalo
please
well
said
common
bond
of
human
beings
the
sitting
at
the
same
table
the
sharing
of
the
bread
and
salt
now
they
were
sitting
opposite
each
other
they
ate
a
little
more
in
symbol
than
in
reality
there
was
fresh
bread
i
made
it
myself
she
said
but
it
s
getting
hard
to
find
flour
now
that
s
got
no
weevils
in
it
there
was
no
butter
but
honey
and
jam
for
the
bread
and
a
bottle
of
red
wine
and
now
like
a
child
he
began
to
talk
this
was
and
ann
on
riverside
drive
then
the
barriers
had
still
been
up
now
for
the
first
time
he
talked
of
all
those
days
he
showed
even
the
little
scar
of
the
fangs
on
his
hand
and
the
larger
scars
where
he
had
slashed
himself
to
apply
the
suction
pump
he
told
of
his
fear
and
of
his
flight
and
of
the
great
loneliness
that
he
had
never
quite
dared
face
or
imagine
and
as
he
talked
she
often
said
yes
i
know
yes
i
remember
that
too
tell
me
more
as
for
her
she
had
seen
the
catastrophe
itself
she
had
faced
more
than
he
had
and
yet
he
could
see
that
she
had
come
through
better
than
he
she
talked
little
seeming
to
have
no
need
but
she
drew
him
on
as
he
talked
with
her
he
knew
now
at
last
that
this
at
least
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
no
mere
casual
meeting
or
passing
moment
in
this
lay
all
the
future
here
and
there
and
no
one
before
had
ever
held
him
perhaps
time
had
healed
him
more
likely
she
herself
was
different
yet
she
was
a
woman
as
the
minutes
slipped
by
he
sensed
that
basic
reality
more
and
more
with
an
intensity
that
made
him
tremble
as
between
man
and
man
the
breaking
of
bread
was
the
reality
the
shared
table
all
the
symbol
needed
but
as
between
man
and
woman
there
must
be
still
more
in
reality
and
in
symbol
a
further
sharing
they
realized
suddenly
that
neither
knew
the
other
s
name
although
each
had
been
calling
the
dog
princess
ishenvood
he
said
that
was
my
mother
s
maiden
name
and
so
she
stuck
it
on
me
bad
was
nt
it
everybody
called
me
ish
i
m
em
she
said
emma
that
is
of
course
ish
and
em
we
wo
nt
get
very
far
writing
poetry
about
that
combination
and
she
was
another
sharing
and
yet
it
was
not
the
final
one
there
were
ways
these
things
were
done
he
had
known
men
who
could
do
them
had
seen
them
at
work
but
he
ish
was
not
the
right
kind
all
those
qualities
which
had
permitted
him
to
be
by
himself
and
survive
through
the
bad
days
alone
all
those
qualities
now
came
up
to
work
against
him
and
he
sensed
too
very
deeply
that
they
would
be
wrong
the
old
methods
had
worked
in
the
days
when
there
were
girls
in
every
cocktail
bar
looking
for
adventure
but
now
such
methods
were
not
right
he
knew
and
knew
deeply
at
this
time
when
the
vast
city
stretched
away
empty
in
all
directions
outside
of
the
windows
and
all
the
ways
of
the
world
had
vanished
and
this
woman
had
lived
through
all
the
catastrophe
and
the
fear
and
the
loneliness
and
now
had
come
out
on
the
other
side
still
with
courage
in
her
eyes
and
affirmation
and
laughter
for
say
some
kind
of
marriage
vows
quakers
could
marry
themselves
why
could
nt
others
they
could
stand
up
together
and
face
toward
the
east
where
the
morning
sun
would
rise
and
then
he
sensed
that
the
mere
babbling
of
words
was
in
itself
much
more
dishonest
even
than
a
straightforward
feeling
for
the
knee
under
the
table
he
realized
that
he
had
been
silent
for
what
might
have
been
a
full
minute
she
was
looking
across
at
him
with
level
calm
eyes
and
he
knew
that
she
read
his
thoughts
in
his
embarrassment
he
rose
suddenly
to
his
feet
upsetting
the
chair
as
he
got
up
then
the
table
between
them
had
ceased
to
be
a
symbol
joining
them
together
and
now
held
them
apart
he
stepped
from
behind
it
and
across
toward
her
as
she
rose
up
too
and
then
there
was
the
softness
of
her
body
against
his
o
song
of
songs
thine
eyes
my
love
are
gentle
and
the
fullness
of
thy
lips
is
soft
and
firm
thy
neck
is
the
softness
of
thy
breasts
against
me
is
like
fine
wool
thy
thighs
are
firm
and
strong
like
the
cedars
song
of
songs
she
had
gone
now
into
the
inner
room
he
sat
still
with
breath
and
heart
quick
tense
and
waiting
he
had
only
one
fear
now
in
a
world
where
there
were
no
doctors
and
even
no
other
women
how
could
anyone
risk
the
chance
but
she
had
gone
he
realized
that
she
too
in
her
great
affirmation
would
consider
this
also
and
care
for
it
o
song
of
songs
my
love
thy
bed
is
fragrant
as
boughs
of
the
pine
tree
and
thy
body
is
warm
thou
art
ashtoreth
thou
art
aphrodite
that
keepest
the
gate
of
love
now
my
strength
is
upon
me
now
the
rivers
are
pent
up
now
is
my
hour
oh
receive
me
in
thine
infinitude
he
lay
quietly
awake
after
she
slept
beside
him
and
his
thoughts
rushed
by
him
so
fast
that
he
could
that
was
what
she
had
said
before
earlier
in
the
evening
no
matter
what
happened
to
the
world
it
did
not
change
the
person
and
he
remained
what
he
had
been
yes
that
was
the
way
though
so
much
had
happened
and
even
though
he
might
be
deeply
moved
by
that
great
experience
yet
still
he
was
the
observer
the
man
who
sat
by
the
side
watching
what
happened
never
quite
losing
himself
in
the
experience
the
strangeness
in
the
old
world
it
might
well
like
those
war
communiques
where
our
gallant
troops
arc
always
falling
back
to
more
favorable
positions
you
mean
you
re
not
going
to
do
the
play
asked
eric
his
mouth
and
throat
dry
and
his
eyeballs
burning
no
i
do
nt
mean
that
all
i
mean
is
that
at
this
moment
i
do
nt
know
where
the
hell
i
am
i
ve
just
had
a
session
for
a
reasonable
length
of
time
frank
lundwell
of
equity
was
there
and
we
fixed
it
so
that
they
ll
continue
for
ten
days
on
rehearsal
pay
if
by
then
i
ca
nt
cast
the
part
all
bets
are
off
and
nobody
s
bound
it
s
a
special
concession
but
lundwell
is
sure
it
ll
be
approved
by
the
equity
council
that
gives
me
ten
days
to
turn
around
in
the
next
problem
is
where
to
turn
do
nt
you
think
that
miss
prengle
could
do
it
said
eric
i
liked
the
way
she
did
it
the
other
day
so
did
i
and
i
ve
been
thinking
it
over
she
s
been
on
my
neck
about
it
and
i
m
going
to
give
her
a
reading
but
jesus
i
do
nt
know
excuse
me
said
irina
lanski
but
do
nt
you
think
that
s
rather
risky
i
wish
you
d
heard
her
the
other
day
said
eric
she
said
but
it
takes
more
than
just
ability
to
carry
a
part
like
that
in
new
york
she
had
had
a
full
report
of
everything
that
had
happened
from
florence
fulham
that
s
it
said
thompson
if
it
were
summer
stock
or
even
a
road
company
i
d
take
a
chance
but
this
part
calls
for
experience
and
for
technique
and
she
has
nt
got
either
i
can
give
her
a
lot
of
course
but
i
doubt
if
she
d
ever
be
able
to
sustain
that
long
part
would
nt
it
look
rather
funny
too
said
irina
lanski
to
have
an
unknown
little
girl
supported
by
reggie
olmsted
and
flossie
fulham
yes
it
would
i
m
not
sure
they
d
do
it
besides
she
would
nt
rate
any
billing
not
before
we
opened
anyhow
and
that
would
throw
the
whole
thing
out
of
balance
if
we
d
started
with
her
it
might
have
been
different
but
miss
nobody
from
nowhere
no
i
think
we
d
better
count
lily
out
is
nt
there
someone
else
in
hollywood
who
i
ve
been
all
over
that
i
even
thought
of
flying
out
there
again
but
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
i
went
over
the
situation
pretty
thoroughly
last
summer
while
i
was
waiting
for
emily
to
make
up
her
mind
the
girls
i
can
get
i
do
nt
want
and
the
ones
i
d
settle
for
ca
nt
be
pried
loose
there
s
just
one
possibility
and
that
s
may
weeks
do
you
know
her
he
asked
eric
i
think
i
ve
seen
her
once
or
twice
in
the
movies
she
s
not
a
bad
little
actress
and
she
has
nt
been
out
there
long
enough
for
it
to
get
her
down
of
course
she
s
not
the
kind
of
box
office
that
crandall
is
but
her
name
would
mean
something
is
there
any
chance
of
getting
i
just
had
her
on
the
phone
she
wants
to
do
a
play
but
she
s
starting
a
picture
next
week
and
wo
nt
be
available
till
the
end
of
the
year
that
would
mean
postponing
until
january
january
exclaimed
eric
at
the
earliest
that
complicates
things
for
me
i
could
nt
hold
the
cast
of
course
besides
it
means
that
i
ve
either
got
to
sit
around
and
wait
or
else
start
work
on
another
show
in
which
case
i
probably
wo
nt
he
free
in
january
it
does
nt
sound
very
promising
said
irina
lanski
no
it
does
nt
but
i
m
air
mailing
her
a
script
i
should
have
an
answer
by
the
end
of
the
week
if
she
wants
to
do
it
and
we
can
get
together
on
it
i
ll
see
if
i
can
work
out
the
time
schedule
what
about
that
miss
upton
asked
eric
i
saw
her
when
i
was
been
thinking
about
her
too
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
tried
to
reach
her
but
she
s
in
chicago
doing
a
radio
show
and
wo
nt
be
back
until
saturday
by
that
time
i
ought
to
have
some
word
from
may
weeks
if
it
s
no
i
ll
talk
to
ginny
but
i
do
nt
think
she
ll
want
to
do
it
she
s
never
played
anything
but
comedy
and
i
d
have
a
hard
time
convincing
her
that
this
is
a
comedy
yes
i
think
you
would
but
are
nt
there
some
other
actresses
there
are
thousands
of
actresses
but
very
few
of
them
know
how
to
act
i
m
not
going
to
risk
my
reputation
and
a
bushel
basket
of
somebody
s
jack
by
doing
this
play
with
some
girl
i
have
nt
got
confidence
in
no
that
would
be
foolish
said
irina
lanski
well
perhaps
you
will
think
of
someone
else
i
ll
keep
pegging
away
deep
on
this
thing
and
if
there
s
any
chance
of
saving
it
i
certainly
will
i
guess
there
s
not
much
use
my
staying
in
new
york
eric
said
for
want
of
anything
else
to
say
well
not
on
my
account
if
we
need
you
we
ll
let
you
know
we
ve
had
a
tough
break
but
if
you
re
going
to
stay
in
the
theater
there
s
one
thing
you
d
better
learn
early
and
never
forget
and
that
is
that
there
s
no
law
that
compels
anybody
to
be
a
playwright
or
a
producer
except
the
divine
law
that
forbids
us
to
kill
the
creativeness
that
is
within
us
said
irina
lanski
at
her
suggestion
eric
went
around
to
her
office
with
her
myra
leech
looked
up
from
her
clattering
typewriter
to
give
him
a
brief
nod
as
they
went
how
much
it
s
going
to
mean
to
the
united
states
this
uh
new
open
door
policy
in
the
far
east
avarice
and
here
at
home
think
of
what
they
ll
be
able
to
do
with
electricity
in
a
few
years
i
do
nt
think
we
ll
use
gas
for
anything
but
cooking
and
i
must
say
i
ll
welcome
that
the
x
ray
they
re
working
on
that
all
the
time
so
that
it
wo
nt
be
long
before
the
doctors
wo
nt
have
to
cut
you
open
to
see
what
s
the
matter
with
you
there
we
are
well
i
make
it
oh
yes
there
go
the
whistles

william
caldwell

before

she
watched

other

imitated

she
said

she

step
and
put

kissed

connie

she
turned
out
the
library
lights
and
sat
on
the
sofa
and
scotty
kissed
her
and
almost
immediately
she
stretched
out
and
made
room
for
him
to
do
likewise
do
you
want

do
anything
she
said
what
besides
kiss
if
hand
on
her
breasts
and
pressed
them
gently
like
that
she
said
she
kissed
him
and
put
her
hand
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
drew
him
down
to
her
bosom
i

she
glared
defiantly
at
her
sister
who
had
let
a
moment
s
silence
which
ruhama
recognized
as
presaging
a
collision
between
them
she
hoped
to
heaven
there
would
be
one
the
louder
and
more
vituperative
the
better
let
them
rip
at
each
other
and
let
him
see
how
they
looked
at
it
it
was
time
it
was
more
than
time
if
they
would
only
hurry
if
one
of
them
would
only
blurt
out
something
the
other
could
take
her
up
for
they
both
drew
breath
to
start
and
askwani
came
riding
in
from
the
cattle
ducking
his
head
for
the
tree
branches
that
caught
his
bridle
buckle
and
left
torn
leaves
bunched
under
the
clasp
i
thought
we
d
better
have
the
bills
of
sale
on
them
cattle
of
yours
he
said
them
buyers
have
been
actin
like
they
thought
the
whole
bunch
was
stole
and
it
wo
nt
hurt
to
show
em
that
ours
ai
nt
we
re
down
to
a
deal
with
em
it
looks
like
twelve
dollars
and
a
half
ai
nt
much
it
s
worth
something
to
have
em
off
of
our
hands
twelve
dollars
and
a
half
warne
said
and
got
up
the
tart
cartwright
girl
started
to
laugh
and
then
looked
hastily
away
and
did
nt
the
plump
one
opened
her
mouth
and
clasped
her
hands
over
her
bosom
and
then
unclasped
them
and
pulled
her
dress
up
at
the
neck
warne
turned
back
to
askwani
i
thought
i
d
taught
you
better
than
to
talk
any
such
price
as
that
for
cattle
with
anybody
them
buyers
must
have
took
you
for
a
couple
of
born
fools
it
ai
nt
as
bad
as
it
sounds
askwani
said
the
herd
s
streaky
you
know
that
some
s
old
and
some
s
light
some
of
the
cows
we
got
from
that
german
colony
belong
in
the
boneyard
and
some
of
old
cartwright
s
ai
nt
much
better
the
fair
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
price
em
out
one
at
a
time
and
nt
handle
any
cattle
that
way
none
of
these
buyers
will
you
could
have
offered
to
average
the
herd
with
em
warne
said
any
buyer
will
do
that
and
make
his
bid
by
the
pound
did
nt
i
teach
you
how
to
average
cattle
or
have
you
forgot
we
talked
about
that
askwani
said
they
d
have
done
it
but
we
would
nt
make
anything
on
it
i
was
afraid
to
try
it
for
fear
we
d
lose
even
if
we
come
out
ahead
it
would
nt
amount
to
enough
to
fool
away
our
time
on
we
d
be
better
off
to
sell
em
and
be
done
with
it
so
we
can
git
back
to
what
we
ve
got
laid
out
to
do
at
home
we
do
nt
sell
any
cattle
for
less
than
they
ought
to
bring
warne
said
he
was
not
stern
about
it
he
was
reassuring
meaning
it
for
the
plump
cartwright
girl
go
on
out
there
with
you
if
your
buyers
want
to
bid
by
the
pound
we
ll
do
business
with
em
i
ll
show
em
some
things
about
averagin
cattle
that
cincinnati
never
heard
of
or
st
louis
either
you
ll
fool
away
another
week
or
ten
days
dickerin
around
with
buyers
here
and
make
about
eight
dollars
out
of
it
askwani
said
we
d
make
ten
times
that
if
we
went
on
home
and
got
back
to
work
we
ll
make
a
sight
more
than
any
eight
dollars
warne
said
you
ve
let
em
talk
them
cattle
down
to
you
i
ll
show
you
how
to
handle
a
buyer
money
ai
nt
all
there
is
to
this
even
if
it
is
all
you
think
of
i
ll
be
back
in
around
an
hour
askwani
looked
resignedly
at
ruhama
and
turned
his
horse
back
through
the
trees
scattering
leaves
as
his
bridle
caught
among
them
warne
strode
after
to
keep
up
ruhama
went
back
into
the
tent
still
hurting
with
disappointment
that
they
had
nt
got
into
one
of
their
fights
in
front
of
him
the
baby
was
lying
on
a
pile
of
blankets
trying
placidly
to
catch
a
bald
hornet
that
was
circling
overhead
a
little
out
of
reach
she
drove
the
hornet
out
gingerly
being
afraid
of
them
herself
and
noticed
that
the
camp
meeting
services
had
tapered
down
to
a
few
women
gabbling
together
near
the
platform
men
were
hurrying
through
the
trees
and
out
toward
the
cattle
pasture
she
even
saw
two
or
three
of
the
preachers
hurrying
along
with
them
they
all
disappeared
and
the
women
stopped
talking
and
left
for
a
long
time
there
was
only
silence
it
was
a
little
scary
since
the
main
purpose
of
camp
meetings
was
to
escape
from
silence
when
it
was
almost
time
for
warne
to
be
back
she
heard
a
clatter
and
scrape
of
branches
from
the
direction
of
the
pasture
and
old
grandma
luttrell
came
driving
her
to
a
halt
nobody
had
any
idea
how
old
grandma
luttrell
was
she
could
have
been
a
hundred
by
her
looks
but
she
took
care
of
herself
asked
help
or
favor
from
nobody
and
drove
her
buckboard
like
a
long
line
skinner
for
the
overland
mail
she
had
driven
hard
from
somewhere
her
horses
were
sweaty
plastered
with
quivering
skifts
of
foam
and
marked
with
welts
across
the
back
where
she
had
applied
the
whip
that
girl
baby
in
the
tent
there
she
said
fetch
her
out
and
put
her
here
in
the
seat
by
me
you
ll
need
to
have
her
off
your
hands
for
a
while
then
spread
them
blankets
out
longer
long
enough
for
a
man
and
hurry
up
they
ll
be
here
with
him
in
a
couple
of
minutes
a
few
stray
urchins
from
the
camp
meeting
flitted
past
through
the
underbrush
and
falling
hovering
at
our
own
marks
then
falling
then
rising
who
can
set
a
mark
or
measure
