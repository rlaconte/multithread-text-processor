clean
and
smooth

she
felt
the
floor
with

hands
it
was
cool
and
iron
colored
and
silky
as
mcwhorter

driveway
she
wished

best
cured
concrete

she
enjoyed
her
errands
straight
to
the
bus
station
where
she
found
the
silver
mercedes
though
she
wanted
to
try
the
keys
and
practice
starting
the
car
she
decided
not
to
someone
might
see
her
she
would
do
her
errands
wait
until
dark
and
drive
to
the
country
club
nobody
saw
this
what
people
in
the
world
do
this
is
called
joining
the
work
force
it
is
not
a
had
way
to
live
one
gets
a
job
there
is
a
task
and
a
task
teller
a
person
who
tells
you
a
task
a
set
of
directions
instructions
perhaps
a
map
a
carrying
out
of
the
task
a
finishing
of
the
task
a
return
to
the
task
teller
to
report
success
a
thanking
a
getting
paid
an
assignment
of
another
task
she
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
what
a
discovery
to
get
a
job
do
it
well
which
is
a
pleasure
please
the
employer
which
is
also
a
pleasure
and
get
paid
which
is
yet
another
pleasure
what
a
happy
life
employees
have
how
happy
it
must
make
them
to
do
their
jobs
well
and
please
their
employers
that
was
the
secret
all
this
time
she
had
made
a
mistake
she
had
thought
and
her
mother
had
expected
that
she
must
trick
lay
in
leading
the
most
ordinary
life
imaginable
get
an
ordinary
job
in
itself
a
joy
in
its
very
ordinariness
and
then
be
as
extraordinary
or
ordinary
as
one
pleased
that
was
the
secret
on
to
western
union
which
was
part
of
the
greyhound
bus
station
as
she
wrote
the
message
she
tried
not
to
make
sense
of
it
the
telegram
cost
when
the
clerk
read
the
message
she
said
to
him
casually
but
with
authority
straight
message
please
right
said
the
clerk
not
raising
his
eyes
victory
she
had
made
it
in
the
world
not
only
could
she
make
herself
understood
people
even
understood
what
she
said
when
she
did
nt
it
was
a
pleasure
spending
her
money
for
him
why
she
wondered
ordinarily
she
hoarded
her
pennies
ate
dandelion
and
dock
salad
she
sat
on
her
bench
but
in
a
new
way
the
buildings
and
the
stores
were
the
same
but
more
accessible
she
might
have
business
in
them
sparkling
in
the
sun
a
cardboard
sign
in
the
window
announced
a
concert
by
le
hug
a
rock
group
what
a
pleasure
to
have
a
job
smiling
she
hugged
herself
and
rocked
in
the
sun
imagine
getting
paid
for
a
task
by
the
task
teller
money
wherewith
to
live
and
live
a
life
so
years
decades
so
that
was
the
system
quel
system
a
real
townie
she
felt
like
now
bustling
past
slack
jawed
hippies
moony
eyed
tourists
blue
haired
lady
leafers
antiquers
and
quilt
collectors
when
she
went
into
a
building
the
dog
stayed
on
the
sidewalk
paying
no
attention
to
anyone
until
she
came
out
he
showed
his
pleasure
not
by
wagging
his
tail
but
by
burying
his
heavy
anvil
head
in
her
stomach
until
his
eyes
were
covered
there
was
no
way
to
see
dr
battle
except
to
sign
a
clipboard
and
wait
her
turn
as
a
patient
she
had
to
wait
two
hours
she
liked
him
though
he
was
too
busy
and
groggy
from
overwork
and
thought
she
was
in
a
fond
dazed
rush
not
listening
we
go
back
at
crack
of
dawn
on
monday
driving
like
hell
to
meet
the
schedule
and
lord
help
us
if
we
have
a
flat
or
any
little
tie
up
on
the
way
it
s
nice
to
get
out
of
the
city
emily
told
morgan
she
removed
a
camera
from
the
suitcase
and
closed
the
lid
again
leon
thought
we
could
nt
take
the
time
but
i
said
leon
i
m
tired
i
want
to
go
i
m
tired
of
puppets
she
s
tired
of
puppets
leon
said
whose
idea
were
they
i
d
like
to
know
whose
were
they
in
the
first
place
i
m
only
doing
what
you
said
to
emily
you
there
s
no
good
reason
we
ca
nt
leave
them
for
a
weekend
leon
she
thinks
we
can
just
leave
whenever
we
like
leon
told
morgan
morgan
passed
a
hand
across
his
forehead
he
said
please
i
m
sure
this
will
all
work
out
do
nt
you
want
to
come
see
the
ocean
now
neither
leon
nor
emily
answered
him
they
stood
facing
each
other
across
the
bed
their
backs
very
straight
as
ifpbraced
for
something
serious
they
did
nt
even
seem
to
notice
when
morgan
left
the
room
no
it
had
nt
been
such
a
good
idea
to
ask
them
here
the
weekend
passed
so
slowly
it
did
nt
so
much
pass
as
chafe
along
it
ground
to
a
stop
and
started
up
again
it
rasped
on
morgan
s
nerves
actually
this
was
not
entirely
the
merediths
fault
it
was
more
the
fault
of
brindle
who
faded
into
tears
a
dozen
times
a
day
or
bonny
who
overdid
kate
who
was
arrested
in
ocean
city
on
charges
of
possessing
half
an
ounce
of
marijuana
but
morgan
blamed
the
merediths
anyhow
he
could
nt
help
but
feel
that
leon
s
sulkiness
had
cast
some
kind
of
evil
spell
and
he
was
irritated
by
the
way
emily
hung
around
bonny
all
the
time
who
had
befriended
emily
first
after
all
who
had
first
discovered
her
she
had
changed
just
wearing
different
shoes
on
her
feet
had
somehow
altered
her
he
began
to
avoid
her
he
devoted
himself
to
gina
a
sad
sprouty
child
at
an
awkward
age
just
the
age
to
tear
at
his
heart
he
made
her
a
kite
from
a
hefty
bag
and
she
thanked
him
earnestly
but
when
he
looked
into
her
face
he
saw
that
she
was
really
watching
her
parents
who
were
arguing
in
low
voices
at
the
other
end
of
the
porch
he
began
reflecting
on
joshua
bennett
a
new
neighbor
back
in
baltimore
this
bennett
was
an
antique
dealer
like
henry
the
eighth
and
he
lived
a
gentlemanly
life
eating
small
expensive
suppers
then
reading
leatherbound
history
books
while
twirlinga
snifter
of
brandy
early
last
spring
when
bennett
first
moved
in
morgan
had
paid
a
call
on
him
and
found
him
in
a
maroon
velvet
smoking
jacket
with
quilted
satin
lapels
where
would
one
go
to
buy
a
smoking
jacket
bennett
had
somehow
received
the
impression
that
morgan
had
descended
from
an
ancient
baltimore
shipping
family
and
owned
an
atticful
of
antique
bronzes
and
he
had
been
most
cordial
offering
morgan
some
of
his
brandy
and
an
ivory
tipped
cigar
morgan
wondered
if
bennett
would
have
accepted
an
invitation
to
the
beach
he
began
plotting
his
return
to
baltimore
the
friendship
he
would
strike
up
the
conversations
they
would
have
he
could
hardly
wait
to
get
back
meanwhile
the
weekend
dragged
on
kate
had
disgraced
the
family
bonny
said
now
she
was
on
the
police
files
marked
for
life
bonny
seemed
to
take
this
very
seriously
her
because
the
cottage
had
no
telephone
the
ocean
city
police
had
had
to
call
the
bethany
police
and
have
them
notify
the
gowers
naturally
therefore
the
news
would
be
everywhere
now
saturday
at
breakfast
bonny
laid
a
blazing
hand
on
louisa
s
arm
and
asked
kate
how
do
you
think
your
grandma
feels
her
late
husband
s
name
which
up
till
now
has
been
unbesmirched
morgan
had
never
heard
her
use
the
word
unbesmirched
before
and
he
was
nt
even
sure
that
it
existed
he
took
some
time
thinking
it
over
louisa
meanwhile
went
on
calmly
spooning
grapefruit
what
do
you
say
mother
bonny
asked
her
louisa
peered
out
of
her
sunken
eyes
and
said
well
i
do
nt
know
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
we
used
to
give
little
babies
marijuana
any
old
time
it
soothed
their
teething
no
no
mother
that
was
belladonna
bonny
said
kate
merely
looked
in
a
row
and
watched
like
members
of
a
jury
and
on
the
beach
where
the
ocean
curled
and
flattened
beneath
a
deep
blue
bowl
of
sky
and
gulls
floated
overhead
as
slow
as
sails
this
group
was
a
motley
scramble
of
blankets
thermoses
sandy
towels
an
umbrella
that
bared
half
its
spokes
every
time
the
wind
flapped
past
a
squawking
radio
and
scattered
leaves
of
newspaper
kate
who
had
been
grounded
for
the
rest
of
her
vacation
flipped
angrily
through
seventeen
bonny
sweated
and
shivered
in
layers
of
protective
garments
the
white
zinc
oxide
on
her
nose
and
lower
lip
along
with
her
huge
black
sunglasses
gave
her
the
look
of
some
insect
creature
from
a
science
fiction
movie
gina
dug
a
hole
in
the
sand
and
climbed
into
it
billy
and
priscilla
made
a
spectacle
of
themselves
lying
too
close
together
on
their
blanket
and
emily
in
an
unbecoming
pale
blue
swimsuit
that
exposedher
thin
limp
legs
took
pictures
that
were
going
to
turn
out
poorly
she
worried
that
he
would
snap
her
she
said
morgan
swore
he
would
nt
she
was
already
pasted
in
his
mind
as
he
would
like
her
to
be
forever
wearing
her
liquid
black
skirt
and
ballet
slippers
he
would
surely
not
choose
to
record
this
other
self
she
had
become
all
i
want
to
do
he
told
her
is
photograph
some
groups
some
action
do
nt
you
see
he
could
nt
bear
her
finicky
delays
ca
nt
patrick
leaned
toward
him
and
his
face
was
one
jason
had
never
seen
before
it
was
tight
and
knowing
and
not
too
kind
laddie
you
know
that
not
all
of
our
guests
are
nice
virtuous
married
folk
you
ve
known
that
for
years
but
we
do
nt
blatantly
advertise
that
illicit
couples
are
particularlyinvited
we
do
nt
imply
we
re
running
a
brothel
if
we
have
to
shut
our
eyes
to
some
things
well
as
you
once
said
mr
mulligan
that
s
business
jason
s
voice
had
become
bitter
i
m
not
a
seminarian
mr
mulligan
i
do
know
something
of
the
world
i
know
we
ca
nt
demand
that
every
couple
who
comes
to
ipswich
house
show
us
a
marriage
certificate
dammit
but
we
do
try
to
run
a
decent
place
and
that
spwhy
we
have
a
good
guest
list
of
respectable
people
mainly
but
literally
to
advertise
you
mean
implying
not
advertising
jason
said
daniel
not
even
schofield
would
be
so
blatant
jason
gave
him
a
scathing
glance
he
is
nt
actually
going
to
advertise
what
the
place
will
be
in
the
newspapers
he
ll
just
spread
the
word
i
accused
him
and
he
never
denied
it
word
of
mouth
is
almost
as
good
as
advertising
outright
who
knows
said
daniel
and
shrugged
and
looked
at
his
uncle
patrick
said
you
re
not
as
white
as
snow
yourself
jase
you
visited
mrs
lindon
s
establishment
before
you
married
my
daughter
now
now
let
me
finish
i
know
that
patricia
s
delicate
always
was
i
know
it
would
kill
her
to
have
more
children
i
do
nt
condemn
you
laddie
not
at
all
men
are
men
and
women
are
women
but
you
re
not
one
to
sit
in
judgment
either
jason
had
become
very
pale
i
d
rather
see
you
in
some
nice
clean
place
like
mrs
lindon
s
than
killing
my
daughter
making
her
have
more
children
i
know
you
love
my
colleen
and
you
re
sparing
her
it
s
glad
i
am
you
are
jason
you
re
a
considerate
husband
not
a
bad
one
and
how
many
men
do
you
think
are
like
you
if
you
blame
anyone
i
m
thinking
you
should
blame
nature
who
did
it
all
it
s
not
of
our
choosing
jason
said
and
it
s
nature
that
makes
us
shit
too
but
we
do
it
privately
not
publicly
with
music
patrick
smiled
it
s
not
the
same
kind
of
pleasure
jase
jason
s
fists
clenched
again
he
was
still
pale
have
you
given
a
thought
mr
mulligan
to
the
young
girls
who
will
be
involved
in
all
this
jase
said
patrick
no
one
forces
any
girl
into
what
is
called
a
life
of
sin
never
mind
the
tales
of
white
slavers
that
s
very
rare
a
girl
chooses
her
life
i
doubt
that
schofield
s
hotel
will
be
filled
with
streetwalkers
and
sluts
and
cheap
whores
men
who
go
there
will
be
rich
enough
to
afford
the
best
naughty
ladies
no
doubt
but
beautiful
and
stylish
ones
like
many
who
come
to
the
inn
tavern
and
ipswich
house
his
eyes
narrowed
on
jason
pand
they
were
not
too
friendly
and
jason
felt
something
quite
close
to
despair
ladies
such
as
uncle
pat
mentions
usually
retire
on
rich
estates
said
daniel
smiling
they
re
do
nt
break
your
heart
over
them
jason
many
are
well
paid
actresses
and
chorus
girls
the
florodorasextet
did
very
richly
for
themselves
i
ve
seen
many
of
them
in
splendid
cadillacs
on
fifth
avenue
they
also
live
in
little
mansions
with
servants
and
travel
abroad
after
their
retirement
some
have
famous
shops
exclusive
restaurants
or
own
jewelry
stores
some
even
married
wealthy
men
i
see
i
m
getting
nowhere
said
jason
what
i
am
interested
in
said
patrick
is
has
he
any
idea
who
owns
my
thousand
acres
jason
felt
very
tired
after
all
he
had
not
slept
all
night
i
do
nt
think
so
he
said
in
a
dull
voice
but
he
ll
find
out
and
that
s
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
sir
to
ask
you
not
to
sell
to
him
if
he
offers
he
wo
nt
find
out
said
patrick
he
paused
no
jason
saw
a
deep
look
being
exchanged
between
uncle
and
nephew
and
felt
sicker
than
ever
think
patrick
mused
to
daniel
a
thousand
dollars
an
acre
he
pulled
a
paper
toward
him
and
a
pencil
he
figured
then
he
whistled
damn
he
said
we
could
ask
more
he
probably
wants
it
badly
enough
said
daniel
we
could
pay
off
the
mortgage
on
ipswich
house
and
finish
the
new
hotel
and
more
jason
said
have
you
thought
what
will
happen
if
he
wo
nt
buy
at
your
price
mr
mulligan
we
could
nt
build
a
respectable
hotel
next
to
his
he
ll
buy
said
daniel
i
say
at
least
fifteen
hundred
dollars
an
acre
it
s
choice
property
i
ll
look
into
it
at
once
jason
stood
up
his
eyes
were
sore
with
sleeplessness
he
turned
slowly
defeated
he
saw
molly
near
been
there
unnoticed
her
eyes
encountered
his
and
her
face
was
both
compassionate
and
understanding
he
wanted
to
go
to
her
and
hold
her
the
longing
was
like
a
terrible
hunger
in
him
it
was
a
desire
for
a
refuge
in
a
strange
and
alien
land
a
desire
for
love
and
companionship
and
surcease
but
as
he
went
toward
the
door
she
moved
aside
though
she
did
not
look
away
from
him
he
left
the
office
the
two
men
and
molly
watched
him
go
then
daniel
said
coldly
i
knew
it
was
wrong
of
you
uncle
pat
to
put
him
on
the
deed
he
ll
never
agree
there
are
ways
said
patrick
and
thought
of
his
daughter
who
loved
money
even
more
than
she
did
her
children
patricia
was
a
sensible
girl
for
a
considerable
time
now
patrick
had
been
aware
of
patricia
s
shrewdness
a
trait
he
had
not
known
earlier
in
her
life
he
was
quite
of
course
it
s
yours
go
call
the
police
what
for
why
not
just
steal
it
back
well
you
want
the
thief
arrested
do
nt
you
yes
he
said
but
meanwhile
it
s
parked
in
a
no
parking
none
and
i
might
be
given
a
ticket
when
it
was
nt
you
that
parked
it
there
you
never
can
tell
in
this
world
he
said
i
promised
bonny
i
would
nt
run
up
more
traffic
fines
he
was
trying
all
the
doors
but
they
were
locked
he
walked
around
to
the
front
of
the
car
and
settled
on
his
haunches
before
the
grille
i
do
nt
suppose
he
said
my
what
no
he
plucked
at
a
string
that
was
looped
through
the
grille
then
he
set
his
face
close
and
started
gnawing
at
the
string
i
he
woman
who
d
been
painting
lowered
her
brush
and
turned
to
watch
i
do
nt
understand
what
you
re
after
emily
said
the
key
morgan
said
something
clinked
to
the
ground
he
groped
beneath
the
car
for
it
over
to
your
right
emily
told
him
closer
to
the
wheel
morgan
stretched
out
on
his
stomach
with
his
legs
trailing
behind
him
the
soles
of
his
snake
proof
boots
were
as
deeply
ridged
as
snow
tires
he
reached
farther
under
the
car
got
it
he
said
a
little
three
wheeled
mail
truck
the
size
of
a
golf
cart
bounced
up
and
stopped
help
morgan
shouted
and
he
raised
his
head
she
heard
his
helmet
clang
against
the
underside
of
the
bumper
i
i
m
run
over
it
s
my
leg
a
mailman
descended
from
the
truck
whistling
and
started
toward
the
mailbox
emily
grabbed
his
sleeve
and
said
move
huh
move
the
truck
you
ve
run
a
man
over
morgan
s
passing
sheesh
said
the
mailman
do
nt
he
see
the
no
parking
sign
move
that
truck
this
instant
i
tell
you
all
right
all
right
the
mailman
said
he
turned
back
to
his
truck
glancing
down
at
morgan
on
the
way
morgan
showed
him
a
face
that
seemed
all
teeth
hurry
said
emily
wringing
a
handful
of
skirt
meanwhile
the
woman
with
the
paintbrush
arrived
dripping
apple
green
oh
that
poor
poor
man
she
said
emily
knelt
next
to
morgan
she
had
a
sick
weight
on
the
floor
of
her
stomach
but
at
least
there
was
no
blood
morgan
tire
looked
flattened
but
still
in
one
piece
he
was
breathing
raggedly
emily
laid
a
hand
on
his
back
are
you
in
pain
she
asked
him
not
as
much
as
you
might
expect
he
s
going
to
move
the
truck
of
all
the
damn
fool
ridiculous
never
mind
it
could
happen
to
anyone
emily
said
patting
his
back
i
was
talking
about
the
mailman
oh
the
mailman
released
his
brake
the
truck
gave
a
grinding
sound
and
inched
backward
oof
said
morgan
he
rolled
free
he
sat
up
and
inspected
his
leg
a
dusty
wedge
shaped
mark
ran
down
the
green
fabric
is
it
broken
emily
asked
him
i
do
nt
know
rip
his
pants
the
woman
with
the
paintbrush
suggested
not
the
pants
said
morgan
they
re
world
war
two
emily
started
folding
up
might
have
to
see
by
now
two
old
ladies
with
shopping
bags
had
joined
them
and
the
mailman
was
telling
them
i
could
report
him
for
illegal
parking
if
i
was
that
bad
of
a
guy
there
s
nothing
here
emily
said
she
was
inspecting
morgan
s
pale
hairy
shin
can
you
wiggle
your
toes
yes
can
you
stand
he
attempted
it
with
an
arm
around
emily
for
support
ile
was
heavier
than
he
looked
hard
muscled
warm
and
he
gave
off
the
harsh
gray
smell
of
someone
who
d
been
smoking
for
a
very
long
time
yes
he
said
i
can
stand
maybe
he
just
ran
over
your
trousers
he
drew
back
from
her
that
s
not
true
at
all
he
said
but
there
s
no
blood
the
bone
s
not
broken
i
felt
it
i
felt
the
pressure
of
my
calf
you
think
i
do
nt
know
when
i
m
hit
not
all
hurts
show
up
from
outside
you
ca
nt
just
stand
outside
and
pass
judgment
on
whether
i
ve
been
injured
or
not
you
think
i
do
nt
know
when
a
u
s
government
mail
truck
pins
me
flat
to
the
pavement
jesus
said
the
mailman
the
two
old
ladies
went
on
their
way
and
the
woman
returned
to
her
painting
the
mailman
unlocked
the
mailbox
morgan
held
up
a
hand
something
glittered
but
at
least
i
ve
got
the
key
he
told
emily
oh
yes
the
key
he
opened
the
door
on
the
passenger
side
quick
jump
in
he
said
me
jump
in
the
car
what
if
the
thief
comes
all
this
racket
this
hullabaloo
he
waited
till
she
d
climbed
in
and
then
he
closed
the
door
and
came
around
to
the
driver
s
side
told
her
i
do
nt
know
why
things
ca
nt
go
a
little
more
smoothly
he
settled
himself
with
a
grunt
and
leaned
forward
to
fit
the
key
in
the
ignition
now
look
he
said
another
difficulty
the
key
would
nt
go
a
second
key
was
already
there
and
a
dangling
leather
case
what
are
these
he
asked
emily
they
must
have
been
locked
in
the
car
she
said
i
m
always
amazed
morgan
said
by
how
incompetent
your
average
criminal
is
morgan
s
passing
but
maybe
the
car
was
nt
stolen
at
all
emily
told
him
how
could
that
be
maybe
you
just
thought
you
parked
in
that
other
block
no
no
he
said
impatiently
that
would
be
ridiculous
he
started
the
motor
veered
out
around
the
mail
truck
and
headed
up
the
street
it
sounded
as
if
he
me
and
meet
bonny
he
said
oh
leon
will
be
wondering
where
i
am
and
anyway
do
nt
you
have
to
go
to
work
i
ca
nt

i
only
had
an
hour
of
sleep
last
night
it
here
s
molly
s
picture
on
the
mantel
is
nt
she
beautiful
it
s
from
her
school
play
they
say
she
has
a
talent
for
acting
i
ca
nt
imagine
where
she
got
it
there
s
never
been
an
actor
in
our
family
what
do
you
think
of
her
bonny
do
nt
we
still
have
jeannie
s
wedding
album
there
was
something
feverish
about
him
emily
thought
ile
darted
around
the
room
rummaging
through
various
overloaded
shelves
emily
and
bonny
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
him
once
they
happened
to
glance
at
each
other
but
when
emily
saw
bonny
s
expression
oddly
hooded
she
looked
away
again
please
she
told
morgan
i
ought
to
be
going
i
but
you
have
nt
met
my
mother
he
said
stopping
short
and
i
wanted
bonny
to
get
to
know
you
i
wanted
you
two
to
bonny
emily
was
in
the
paper
today
was
she
bonny
said
where
s
the
paper
did
you
throw
it
out
i
think
it
s
in
the
kitchen
come
to
the
kitchen
let
s
all
go
let
s
all
have
some
coffee
he
said
he
raced
away
bonny
straightened
from
the
door
frame
to
follow
him
and
emily
trailed
behind
she
wished
she
could
just
vanish
she
thought
of
ducking
out
soundlessly
slipping
away
before
they
noticed
she
dodged
a
mobile
of
homemade
paper
sailing
ships
and
stepped
into
the
kitchen
the
counters
in
the
kitchen
were
stacked
with
dirty
dishes
and
several
animals
feeding
bowls
cluttered
the
floor
one
wall
was
shingled
with
yellow
cartoons
and
news
clippings
and
hockey
schedules
recipes
calendars
dental
appointment
cards
invitations
even
someone
s
high
school
diploma
emily
felt
surrounded
flooded
over
by
the
back
door
morgan
was
plowing
through
a
stack
of
newspapers
where
is
it
where
is
it
did
it
come
he
asked
aha
he
held
up
a
paper
he
laid
it
flat
on
the
floor
licked
his
thumb
and
started
turning
pages
news
editorials
crafts
revival
in
baltimore
peering
over
his
shoulder
emily
saw
leon
s
sober
face
he
seemed
to
be
staring
at
her
out
of
another
world
bonny
here
s
leon
emily
s
husband
morgan
said
and
here
s
her
daughter
gina
see
very
nice
said
bonny
setting
out
coffee
cups
you
know
morgan
said
thoughtfully
i
once
looked
a
little
like
leon
bonny
glanced
at
the
photo
like
that
man
there
never
she
said
well
yes
he
said
but
there
s
something
about
the
eyes
maybe
i
do
nt
know
or
something
around
the
mouth
or
maybe
it
s
the
forehead
i
do
nt
know
he
stood
up
abandoning
the
paper
and
pulled
out
a
chair
from
the
table
sit
down
sit
down
he
told
emily
he
took
a
seat
opposite
as
if
demonstrating
and
fixed
her
with
an
urgent
focused
look
till
she
sat
too
she
felt
trapped
the
dishes
on
the
counters
towered
so
far
above
her
that
she
imagined
they
might
teeter
and
topple
swamping
her
a
typewriter
stood
in
a
puddle
of
orange
juice
on
the
table
with
a
sheet
of
paper
in
the
carriage
resolution
was
passed
by
a
show
of
hands
she
read
and
matilda
grayson
requested
that
bonny
placed
a
carton
of
cream
in
front
of
her
and
a
crumpled
sack
of
pantry
pride
sugar
were
you
working
on
something
yes
bonny
said
she
handed
emily
a
cup
of
coffee
and
sat
down
next
to
her
um
what
do
you
do
for
a
living
mrs
gower
i
m
morgan
s
wife
for
a
living
oh
i
see
yes
bonny
said
but
do
you
see
that
it
s
a
full
time
fob
it
keeps
me
busy
every
minute
i
tell
you
oh
from
outside
he
seems
so
comic
and
light
hearted
such
a
character
so
quaint
but
imagine
dealing
with
him
i
mean
the
details
of
it
the
coping
stuck
at
home
while
he
s
off
somewhere
wondering
who
he
thinks
he
is
now
do
you
suppose
we
could
nt
all
act
like
that
go
swooping
around
in
a
velvet
cape
with
a
red
satin
lining
and
a
feathered
hat
that
part
s
the
easy
part
imagine
being
his
wife
finding
a
cleaner
who
does
ostrich
plumes
keeping
his
dinner
one
of
his
cronies
that
i
have
never
net
salvation
army
burns
or
astrologists
or
whatever
other
awestruck
smitten
people
he
digs
up
emily
set
her
cup
down
you
think
i
do
nt
appreciate
him
you
wonder
why
he
married
me
bonny
said
no
no
said
emily
she
looked
across
at
morgan
who
seemed
unperturbed
he
was
tipping
contentedly
in
his
chair
like
a
child
who
is
confident
he
s
the
center
of
attention
and
puffing
on
a
cigarette
twisted
ropes
of
smoke
hung
around
his
head
emily
bonny
said
emily
turned
to
her
emily
morgan
is
the
manager
of
a
hardware
store
emily
waited
but
that
was
the
end
of
it
bonny
seemed
to
be
expecting
her
to
speak
yes
emily
said
after
a
minute
cullen
hardware
bonny
said
she
knows
that
bonny
morgan
said
she
does
bonny
stared
do
nt
think
he
s
a
rabbi
or
a
greek
shipping
magnate
no
emily
said
she
decided
not
to
mention
how
they
d
met
bonny
pressed
her
fingers
to
her
lips
there
were
freckles
emily
saw
dusting
the
back
of
her
hand
after
all
she
was
a
pleasant
woman
she
gave
a
little
laugh
you
must
think
i
ve
lost
my
mind
she
said
crazy
bonny
right
morgan
s
crazy
wife
bonny
oh
no
it
s
just
that
i
worried
you
might
have
been
misled
morgan
s
such
a
well
prankster
in
a
way
yes
i
know
about
that
you
do
bonny
said
she
glanced
over
at
morgan
morgan
smiled
seraphically
and
blew
out
a
whoosh
of
smoke
but
i
think
he
s
trying
to
give
it
up
said
emily
oh
i
hope
takes
so
much
ingenuity
to
manage
some
of
that
foolishness
think
what
he
could
accomplish
if
he
used
that
brain
for
sensible
things
if
he
straightened
out
the
incredibly
soiled
feeling
as
one
by
one
those
men
no
she
would
not
dwell
on
it
she
closed
her
eyes
and
breathed
deeply
failing
to
notice
the
letter
slip
out
of
her
lap
as
she
changed
position
the
moment
of
strain
passed
the
details
of
that
harrowing
night
successfully
pushed
out
of
her
mind
she
opened
her
eyes
noticed
the
letter
on
the
floor
and
quickly
recovered
it
the
letter
was
from
papa
s
brother
uncle
matt
the
man
who
had
first
encouraged
eleanor
to
try
a
professional
stage
career
matt
kent
had
served
as
a
genial
and
expert
guide
when
she
and
leo
had
honeymooned
in
paris
among
the
theaters
they
d
visited
was
the
comediefrangaise
where
eleanor
s
toolong
marie
charboneau
had
performed
for
a
few
real
news
concerned
tom
the
son
uncle
matt
had
never
seen
before
the
boy
s
birth
matt
s
estranged
wife
dolly
of
whom
he
still
wrote
and
spoke
in
the
most
affectionate
terms
had
gone
out
to
the
north
west
frontier
of
india
as
a
schoolteacher
for
officers
children
now
matt
said
tom
was
hoping
for
a
career
as
an
officer
in
the
indian
army
an
organization
not
to
be
confused
with
the
british
army
in
india
he
pointed
out
down
to
the
very
last
soldier
of
the
line
those
in
the
british
army
in
india
were
englishmen
the
indian
army
included
many
nativeborn
noncommissioned
officers
and
enlisted
men
india
was
a
colorful
if
dangerous
place
to
soldier
uncle
matt
concluded
he
wanted
to
visit
it
and
sketch
its
sights
one
day
eleanor
suspected
that
what
he
really
wanted
was
to
get
his
first
look
at
young
tom
she
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
in
her
reticule
the
train
was
rumbling
past
shanties
and
wooden
tenements
standing
on
turbulent
across
the
river
large
brick
homes
perched
on
a
steep
hillside
their
fronts
supported
on
pilings
the
train
passed
a
factory
complex
eleanor
recalled
pemberton
saying
the
town
s
main
industry
was
steel
but
trivial
things
could
nt
keep
her
mind
off
leo
for
very
long
they
had
been
married
almost
four
and
a
half
years
in
all
that
time
despite
mutual
tenderness
and
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
the
other
they
had
been
unable
to
solve
the
problem
which
was
eleanor
s
legacy
from
that
dreadful
night
in
her
father
had
sensed
the
existence
of
the
problem
of
course
she
could
nt
discuss
it
with
him
but
the
problem
was
so
serious
that
discussions
with
leo
were
inevitable
time
and
again
she
told
him
the
difficulty
did
nt
matter
he
agreed
or
pretended
to
agree
then
contradicted
that
attitude
a
day
or
so
later
by
another
desperate
attempt
to
prove
that
the
problem
did
nt
exist
he
always
failed
she
repeatedly
told
him
the
fault
was
hers
thing
that
might
have
convinced
him
she
could
nt
open
the
imaginary
door
and
by
sharing
the
secret
with
her
husband
destroy
its
power
over
her
she
simply
could
not
do
it
and
so
leo
s
despondency
and
bitterness
grew
steadily
worse
now
the
train
was
rolling
across
a
huge
stone
bridge
at
least
fifty
feet
wide
the
bridge
carried
four
sets
of
tracks
looks
like
we
re
coming
in
pemberton
said
our
hotel
s
the
hulbert
house
it
s
supposed
to
be
the
newest
in
town
before
we
left
new
york
they
wired
that
they
were
heavily
booked
but
i
think
we
managed
to
squeeze
everyone
in
leo
eleanor
tapped
his
arm
his
eyes
opened
we
re
here
she
said
leaning
over
to
kiss
his
closely
shaved
cheek
in
a
night
off
leo
played
marcus
brutus
snap
an
eccentric
and
flamboyant
theatrical
manager
a
role
far
removed
from
the
somber
silence
with
which
he
regarded
her
now
luggage
from
overhead
racks
on
either
side
of
the
train
spread
a
panorama
of
tenements
and
business
buildings
made
indistinct
by
the
rain
and
the
dark
sky
feeling
a
little
more
rested
she
asked
leo
shrugged
i
slept
i
do
nt
think
i
got
much
rest
she
held
back
a
retort
melancholy
was
becoming
a
way
of
life
for
him
she
hated
that
she
knew
he
had
many
more
reasons
than
one
for
becoming
embittered
yet
that
understanding
did
nt
make
it
any
easier
to
live
with
him
he
tugged
the
brim
of
his
derby
down
over
his
forehead
slouched
on
the
seat
and
stared
out
the
window
what
he
saw
quickly
soured
his
expression
god
someone
in
pittsburgh
told
me
they
manufacture
a
lot
of
barbed
wire
here
a
fitting
product
for
such
a
depressing
place
regis
said
it
s
an
excellent
theater
town
oh
certainly
in
this
weather
i
m
sure
we
ll
play
to
all
of
a
dozen
these
days
he
was
so
unlike
the
merry
confident
and
outgoing
leo
goldman
she
d
first
met
at
an
amateur
theatrical
club
in
new
york
he
was
still
handsome
but
the
frustration
caused
by
their
failure
to
achieve
a
satisfying
physical
relationship
seemed
to
be
eroding
his
good
looks
as
well
as
his
good
spirits
one
indicator
of
his
unhappiness
was
the
frequency
with
which
he
reminisced
about
the
past
although
he
d
spent
his
boyhood
in
poverty
on
new
york
s
lower
east
side
he
already
regarded
that
boyhood
with
great
nostalgia
often
after
a
performance
he
would
lie
on
the
bed
in
their
hotel
room
lock
his
hands
under
his
head
and
deliver
a
long
rambling
monologue
about
the
days
when
there
had
been
a
mezuzah
on
the
doorpost
and
pushcarts
selling
oilcloth
garlic
fish
and
a
hundred
other
items
in
the
street
after
a
skimpy
meal
those
carts
could
provide
dessert
if
you
were
clever
and
fast
apples
went
down
your
shirt
front
bananas
newspapers
from
park
row
but
there
had
been
moments
of
relaxation
too
wonderful
moments
there
were
breathtaking
vistas
of
the
city
to
be
seen
from
tenement
rooftops
bright
immies
to
be
won
in
a
marble
shoot
a
rubber
ball
to
be
solidly
whacked
in
the
hester
street
made
that
point
she
was
sure
of
it
at
five
o
clock
she
returned
to
the
courtroom
as
she
entered
the
jury
sent
word
to
the
judge
that
it
had
reached
a
verdict
five
minutes
later
the
foreman
announced
the
verdict
robert
odendall
not
guilty
on
all
counts
jonathan
odendall
not
guilty
on
all
counts
i
do
nt
believe
it
katie
was
nt
sure
if
she
had
spoken
aloud
the
judge
s
face
hardened
into
angry
lines
he
dismissed
the
jury
curtly
and
very
lucky
he
snapped
luckier
than
i
hope
you
ll
ever
be
again
in
either
of
your
lives
now
clear
out
of
my
courtroom
and
if
you
re
smart
you
ll
never
appear
before
me
again
katie
stood
up
no
matter
if
the
judge
clearly
felt
the
verdict
was
erroneous
she
had
lost
the
case
she
should
have
done
more
she
felt
rather
than
saw
the
victorious
smile
the
defense
attorney
shot
at
her
a
thick
hard
lump
burned
in
her
throat
making
it
impossible
to
swallow
she
was
within
inches
of
tears
those
two
criminals
were
about
to
be
released
on
the
streets
after
flouting
justice
a
dead
boy
had
been
labeled
a
criminal
she
stuffed
her
notes
into
her
briefcase
maybe
if
she
had
nt
felt
so
lousy
all
week
she
d
have
conducted
a
better
case
maybe
if
she
d
had
this
hemorrhaging
problem
taken
care
of
a
year
ago
instead
of
delaying
and
putting
it
off
with
this
crazy
childish
fear
of
hospitals
she
will
the
state
please
approach
the
bench
she
looked
up
the
judge
was
beckoning
to
her
she
walked
over
to
him
the
spectators
were
filing
out
she
could
hear
delighted
squeals
as
the
odendalls
embraced
their
gum
chewing
braless
girlfriends
your
honor
katie
managed
to
keep
her
voice
steady
the
judge
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
her
do
nt
let
it
get
you
down
katie
you
proved
that
case
those
little
bastards
will
be
back
here
in
two
months
on
other
charges
we
both
know
it
and
next
time
you
ll
nail
them
katie
tried
to
smile
that
s
just
what
i
m
afraid
of
that
they
will
be
back
god
knows
how
much
damage
they
ll
be
doing
before
we
can
nail
them
but
thanks
judge
she
left
the
courtroom
and
went
back
to
her
office
maureen
looked
up
hopefully
katie
shook
her
head
and
watched
the
expression
change
to
sympathy
she
shrugged
what
can
you
her
office
mr
myerson
and
dr
carroll
are
in
a
meeting
they
do
nt
want
to
be
disturbed
but
of
course
you
can
go
in
no
i
m
sure
it
s
the
lewis
case
and
i
d
be
of
no
use
to
them
or
anyone
else
right
now
i
ll
catch
up
on
monday
all
right
katie
i
m
sorry
about
the
odendall
verdict
but
try
not
to
take
it
so
hard
you
really
look
sick
are
you
all
right
to
drive
you
re
not
dizzy
or
anything
no
really
and
i
m
not
going
far
i
ll
be
driving
just
fifteen
minutes
and
then
i
wo
nt
budge
till
sunday
as
she
walked
to
the
car
katie
shuddered
the
temperature
had
gotten
up
to
about
forty
degrees
in
the
afternoon
but
was
dropping
rapidly
again
the
wet
damp
air
penetrated
the
loose
sleeves
of
her
red
wool
wraparound
coat
and
pierced
her
nylon
hose
she
thought
how
great
it
would
be
to
be
able
to
go
there
now
to
just
go
to
bed
with
a
hot
toddy
and
sleep
the
weekend
away
at
the
hospital
the
admitting
office
had
her
completed
forms
waiting
the
clerk
was
briskly
bright
my
goodness
mrs
demaio
you
certainly
rate
dr
highley
has
given
you
the
bedroom
of
suite
one
on
the
third
floor
that
s
like
going
on
a
vacation
you
ll
never
dream
you
re
in
a
hospital
he
said
something
about
that
katie
murmured
she
was
not
about
to
confide
her
fear
of
hospitals
to
this
woman
you
may
be
a
bit
lonesome
up
there
there
are
just
three
suites
on
that
floor
and
the
other
two
are
empty
and
dr
highley
is
having
the
living
room
of
your
suite
redecorated
why
i
do
nt
know
it
was
done
less
than
a
year
ago
but
anyhow
you
wo
nt
need
it
you
ll
only
be
here
till
sunday
if
you
the
buzzer
the
second
floor
nursing
station
takes
care
of
both
the
second
and
third
floor
patients
they
re
all
dr
highley
s
patients
anyhow
now
here
s
your
wheelchair
if
you
ll
just
get
into
it
we
ll
whisk
you
upstairs
katie
stared
in
consternation
you
do
nt
mean
i
have
to
use
a
wheelchair
now
hospital
regulations
the
admitting
clerk
said
firmly
john
in
a
wheelchair
going
up
for
chemotherapy
john
s
body
shrinking
as
she
watched
him
die
john
s
voice
weakening
his
wry
tired
humor
as
the
wheelchair
was
brought
to
his
bed
swing
low
sweet
chariot
coming
for
to
carry
me
home
the
antiseptic
hospital
smell
katie
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
there
was
no
turning
back
the
attendant
a
middle
aged
solidly
plump
volunteer
pushed
the
chair
down
the
corridor
to
the
elevator
you
re
lucky
to
have
dr
highley
she
informed
katie
his
patients
that
buzzer
for
someone
and
you
ll
have
a
nurse
at
your
beck
and
call
in
thirty
seconds
dr
highley
is
strict
the
whole
staff
trembles
when
he
s
around
but
he
s
good
they
were
at
the
elevator
the
attendant
pushed
the
button
this
place
is
so
different
from
most
hospitals
most
places
do
nt
want
to
see
you
until
you
re
ready
to
deliver
and
then
they
shove
you
out
when
the
baby
is
a
couple
of
days
old
not
dr
highley
i
ve
seen
him
put
pregnant
women
to
bed
here
for
two
months
just
as
a
precaution
that
s
why
he
has
suites
so
people
can
have
a
homelike
atmosphere
mrs
aldrich
is
in
precisely
safaris
through
ancestral
memories
teach
me
many
things
the
patterns
ahhh
the
patterns
liberal
bigots
are
the
ones
who
trouble
me
most
i
distrust
the
extremes
scratch
a
conservative
and
you
find
someone
who
prefers
the
past
over
any
future
scratch
a
liberal
and
find
a
closetaristocrat
it
s
true
liberal
governments
always
develop
into
aristocracies
the
bureaucracies
betray
the
true
intent
of
people
who
form
such
governments
right
from
the
first
the
little
people
who
formed
the
governments
which
promised
to
equalize
the
social
burdens
found
themselves
suddenly
in
the
hands
of
bureaucratic
aristocracies
of
course
all
bureaucracies
follow
this
pattern
but
what
a
hypocrisy
to
find
this
even
under
a
communized
banner
it
s
that
patterns
are
repeated
my
oppressions
by
and
large
are
no
worse
than
any
of
the
others
and
at
least
i
teach
a
new
lesson
the
stolen
journals
it
was
well
into
the
darkness
of
audience
day
before
leto
could
meet
with
the
bene
gesserit
delegation

prepared
the
reverend

for

said
they

tell
me
what
it
was
the
duncan
demanded
of
you
as
you
entered
he
wished
to
know
if
you
had
ever
before
had
someone
flogged
and
you
replied
that
there
was
no
record
of
nor
had
i
ever
before
witnessed
such
a
punishment
his
response
this
is
not
atreides
does
he
think
i
m
insane
he
did
not
say
that
there
was
more
to
your
encounter
what
else

our
new
duncan
he
has
met
the
ixian
ambassador

prevented
moneo
i
trust
you
to
raise
barriers
against
any
liaison
between
the
duncan
and
hwi
my
lord

indeed
i
do
go
now
and
prepare
for
our
meeting
with
the

i
will
receive
them
at

in
this
choice
of
a
meeting

a
whim
on
your
way
out
tell
the
duncan
he
may
take
out
a
troop
of
guards
and
scour
the

for

some
amusement
in

the
reactions
through
the
festival
city
at
the
approach
of
a
disturbed
duncan
idaho
in
command
of
a
fish
speaker

like
the
quick
silence
of
frogs
when
a
predator
comes
now
that
he
was
in
false
sietch

of
irregular
domes
at
the
edge
of
one
false
sietch

almost
a
kilometer
across
it

been
the
first
abode
of
the
museum

and
now
was
their
school
its
corridors
and
chambers
patrolled
by
alert
fish
speakers
the
reception
hall
where
leto
waited
an
oval
about
two
hundred
meters
in
its
long
dimension
was
illuminated
by
giant
glow
globes
which
floated
in
blue
green
isolation
some
thirty
meters
above
the
floor
the
light
muted
the
dull
browns
and
tans
of
the
imitation
stone
from
which
the
entire
structure
had
been
fashioned
leto
waited
on
a
low
ledge
at
one
end
of
the
chamber
looking
outward
through
a
half
circle
window
longer
than
his
body
the
opening
four
stories
above
the
ground
framed
a
view
which
included
a
remnant
of
the
ancient
shield
wall
preserved
for
its
cliffside
caves
where
atreides

had
once
been
slaughtered
by

the
frosty

why

they

what
i
made

as
they

a

in

a

on

whose
origin
we
have
been
unable
to
discover
luyseyal
has
red
hair
and
appears
remarkably
young
for
one
of
her
reputation
as
he
watched
the
reverend
mothers
approach
with
their
entourage
leto
felt
the
quick
surge
of
his
memories
the
women
wore
their
hoods
forward
shrouding
their
faces
the
attendants
and
acolytes
walked
at
a
respectful
distance
behind
it
was
all
of
a
piece
some
patterns
did
not
change
these
women
might
have
been
entering
a
real
sietch
with
real
fremen
here
to
honor
them
their
heads
know
what
their
bodies
deny
he
thought
leto
s
penetrating
vision
saw
the
subservient
caution
in
their
eyes
but
they
strode
up
the
long
chamber
like
people
confident
of
their
religious
power
it
pleased
leto
to
think
that
the
bene
gesserit
possessed
only
such
powers
as
he
permitted
the
reasons
for
this
indulgence
were
clear
to
him
of
all
the
people
in
his
empire
reverend
mothers
were
most
like
him
limited
to
the
memories
of
only
their
female
ancestors
still
each
of
them
did
exist
as
somewhat
of
an
integrated
mob
the
reverend
mothers
came
to
a
stop
at
the
required
ten
paces
from
leto
s
ledge
the
entourage
spread
out
on
each
side
it
amused
leto
to
greet
such
delegations
in
the
voice
and
persona
of
his
grandmother

they
thundered
back
to
him
amid

murrough
drew
a
deep
breath
and
yelled
at
his

celebration

particularly
requested

of
the
outlaw
days
in
thomond
now
they
entered
the
hall
one
by
one
cleaned
and
freshly
dressed
but
with
the
scars
of
their
most
recent
battle
still
on
them
and
brian
gave
to
each
a
special
token
some
treasure
of
exceeding
value
liberated
from
the
norse
city
as
they
came
and
knelt
before
him
the
herald
read
their
names
and
aed
made
a
brief
poem
reciting
aengus
who
had
been
their
physician
when
they
had
no
other
leti
of
the
long
knife
his
face
permanently
scarred
into
a
grin
that
brian
found
beautiful
because
he
knew
its
price
kian
and
brendan
and
illan
finn
the
brothers
loaghaire
and
reardon
bent
knee
fergus
the
fist
and
conaing
the
beautiful
chief
but
no
nessa
nor
ardan
there
were
two
piles
of
treasure
in
their
names
the
finest
of
all
scrupulously
set
aside
on
a
table
apart
from
the
others
and
their
names
and
deeds
were
recited
by
aed
that
all
might
hear
the
torches
burned
late
in
the
hall
and
the
cheering
and
singing
could
be
heard
clearly
in
the
chapel
where
mahon
knelt
you
are
a
born
killer
and
you
will
go
on
killing
mahon
accused
not
looking
at
his
youngest
brother
brian
had
finally
forced
a
confrontation
by
invading
the
king
s
private
chamber
and
now
they
stood
separated
by
more
than
space
in
a
room
brian
scarcely
recognized
it
had
been
gone
from
the
cold
walls
the
floors
were
bare
of
rushes
even
the
wealth
of
lamps
had
been
replaced
by
one
feeble
stub
of
a
candle
the
chamber
now
held
only
a
thin
pallet
and
a
chest
and
one
black
crucifix
hung
on
the
wall
it
was
the
cell
of
an
ascetic
what
have
you
done
with
your
things
brian
asked
ignoring
his
brother
s
accusation
i
do
nt
understand
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
stripped
room
no
of
course
you
do
nt
mahon
answered
all
you
understand
is
warfare
brutality
lust
for
power
you
do
nt
realize
that
material
objects
are
of
no
consequence
compared
to
the
wealth
of
the
spiritual
life
i
ve
been
praying
to
our
lord
to
enlighten
you
as
he
has
me
but
so
far
my
prayers
are
unanswered
brian
scowled
you
do
nt
need
to
pray
for
my
soul
brother
mahon
gave
him
a
look
of
curiously
commingled
disgust
i
must
you
and
i
both
have
so
many
guilts
to
expiate
you
surely
earned
god
s
wrath
for
the
evil
you
unleashed
at
limerick
and
i
is
that
what
this
is
all
about
you
re
trying
to
punish
yourself
for
what
happened
at
limerick
i
could
never
punish
myself
sufficiently
for
what
happened
at
limerick
i
can
only
try
and
beg
god
s
forgiveness
i
misunderstood
the
nature
of
war
i
let
myself
be
seduced
by
the
trappings
and
the
excitement
i
let
my
vanity
blind
me
to
the
horrors
around
me
but
i
can
see
them
all
now
and
i
must
atone
atone
brian
snorted
what
have
you
got
to
atone
for
ivar
and
his
allies
are
nursing
their
wounds
on
some
sandy
island
infested
with
black
flies
where
the
fergus
joins
the
shannon
irish
families
that
have
quarreled
with
one
another
for
years
are
united
now
proud
of
being
munstermen
together
singing
your
praises
and
speaking
of
the
possibility
foreigners
by
god
that
s
an
accomplishment
to
be
proud
of
and
yet
you
sit
here
beating
your
breast
and
crying
mea
culpa
i
tell
you
frankly
brother
i
would
nt
want
a
conscience
like
yours
there
is
no
logic
in
it
mahon
looked
at
him
bleakly
and
i
no
longer
want
a
soul
like
yours
barbarous
and
cruel
you
are
the
wolf
who
devours
the
lambs
to
fill
his
own
belly
marcan
has
convinced
me
that
we
must
walk
in
the
paths
of
peace
accepting
god
s
will
and
marcan
brian
exploded
marcan
is
a
priest
with
his
own
view
of
god
s
will
and
i
do
nt
happen
to
think
that
view
is
right
for
our
situation
i
m
not
even
convinced
that
it
is
god
s
will
that
we
be
victims
though
marcan
used
to
expend
a
lot
of
energy
trying
to
convince
me
of
it
he
could
not
persuade
me
and
so
he
has
gone
to
work
on
you
his
accomplishment
the
deep
voice
was
bitingly
sarcastic
marcan
has
brought
me
peace
brian
he
has
shown
me
that
there
are
other
paths
that
i
may
follow
god
sent
him
to
me
when
i
needed
him
most
god
did
nt
send
him
marcan
came
here
himself
to
beg
your
influence
in
having
him
named
bishop
of
killaloe
marcan
may
preach
humility
but
he
hungers
for
power
within
the
church
as
much
as
any
tribal
king
hungers
to
expand
his
holdings
i
will
war
no
more
brian
no
matter
what
you
say
for
it
brings
me
too
much
pain
i
sent
your
own
brothers
into
battle
ill
prepared
i
think
and
knew
the
guilt
of
seeing
them
die
for
a
kingship
i
did
not
really
value
even
then
i
tried
to
do
better
by
you
and
yet
when
i
see
what
you
have
become
i
think
i
would
rather
have
buried
you
somewhere
in
tipperary
with
lachtna
and
niall
i
will
build
a
new
you
think
that
is
the
best
way
for
you
to
serve
god
charlemagne
built
churches
too
but
he
had
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
it
was
with
that
sword
that
he
brought
christianity
to
the
franks
i
renounce
the
sword
forever
mahon
cried
sensitive
to
something
in
his
tone
brian
studied
the
king
s
face
intently
at
last
he
said
it
is
not
god
s
wrath
that
frightens
you
mineral
realm
itself
threatens
mankind
all
of
life
and
the
world
itself
there
s
poetry
in
that
is
nt
there
man
s
great
technical
works
looming
over
him
have
coated
him
with
deadly
metal
we
ca
nt
carry
the
weight
the
blood
is
sobbing
in
us
our
brains
grow
feebler
this
disaster
also
overtook
the
roman
empire
it
was
nt
the
barbarians
it
was
nt
the
christians
it
was
nt
moral
corruption
his
lead
to
prevent
the
souring
of
wine
lead
was
the
true
source
of
the
madness
of
the
caesars
leaded
wine
brought
the
empire
to
ruin
bones
from
roman
graves
do
show
extreme
concentrations
of
the
metal
said
vlada
i
ve
examined
those
in
my
own
lab
and
that
was
only
rome
now
it
s
the
whole
world
and
it
is
nt
the
grand
inquisitor
s
universal
anthill
that
we
have
to
worry
about
after
all
but
something
worse
more
titanic
universal
stupefaction
a
saturnian
wild
gloomy
murderousness
the
raging
of
irritated
nerves
and
intelligence
reduced
by
metal
poison
so
that
the
main
ideas
of
mankind
die
out
including
of
course
the
idea
of
freedom
corde
breathed
sharply
still
ridding
himself
of
imaginary
smoke
inhalation
he
drew
in
the
blue
icicle
making
air
of
the
small
park
with
its
fallen
fence
of
iron
stakes
collapsed
on
weeds
and
bushes
i
wonder
if
beech
thinks
as
romantically
as
that
said
him
but
who
knows
said
corde
and
i
m
sure
i
m
overdrawing
it
but
if
there
are
mysterious
forces
around
only
exaggeration
can
help
us
to
see
them
we
all
sense
that
there
are
powers
that
make
the
world
we
see
that
when
we
look
at
it
and
other
powers
that
unmake
it
and
when
people
shed
incomprehensible
tears
they
feel
that
they
re
expressing
this
truth
somehow
one
that
may
be
otherwise
inexpressible
in
our
present
condition
but
it
s
a
rare
sense
and
people
are
nt
used
to
it
and
it
ca
nt
get
them
anywhere
tears
may
be
intellectual
but
they
can
never
be
political
they
save
no
man
from
being
shot
no
child
from
being
thrown
alive
into
the
furnace
my
late
father
in
law
would
weep
when
he
lost
a
patient
at
the
same
time
he
belonged
to
the
communist
underground
the
doctor
would
weep
i
wonder
if
the
communist
ever
did
this
is
an
interesting
talk
said
vlada
me
straight
why
of
course
said
corde
i
m
asking
whether
certain
impulses
and
feelings
which
play
no
part
in
the
scientific
work
of
a
man
like
professor
beech
and
lie
ignored
or
undeveloped
in
his
nature
may
not
suddenly
have
come
to
life
these
resurrections
can
be
gruesome
you
can
sometimes
watch
them
clumsy
absurd
heart
stirrings
after
decades
of
atrophy
sometimes
it
s
the
most
heartless
people
who
are
inspired
after
forty
years
of
reckoning
and
calculation
and
begin
to
accuse
everybody
else
of
being
heartless
but
as
i
see
beech
he
s
innocent
of
that
the
news
let
s
call
it
that
reaches
him
in
his
lab
as
he
puts
the
results
of
his
research
in
order
like
this
earth
which
i
ve
been
studying
for
a
lifetime
is
a
being
too
it
gave
birth
to
us
all
but
we
are
ungrateful
greedy
and
evil
and
this
is
news
to
him
to
continue
your
argument
his
feelings
are
untrained
or
undeveloped
better
now
even
if
he
cried
which
is
not
his
way
it
would
nt
be
a
good
approach
to
politics
you
can
see
that
i
sympathize
with
him
and
how
i
wish
that
clear
exquisite
brains
like
his
could
resolve
all
our
questions
they
do
nt
though
it
s
endearing
however
that
he
looks
like
a
hayseed
an
ichabod
crane
but
that
he
s
a
man
of
feeling
and
even
a
visionary
he
wants
to
protect
and
to
bless
but
then
he
begins
to
talk
and
what
neo
darwinian
stuff
he
expounds
the
two
billion
year
struggle
by
organisms
in
the
biosphere
i
d
rather
eat
a
pound
of
dry
starch
with
a
demitasse
spoon
than
read
this
truth
should
have
some
style
that
s
where
you
might
be
of
help
what
if
i
tried
to
speak
for
him
it
would
depend
upon
how
it
was
done
it
depends
upon
what
he
would
expect
there
would
be
no
saved
from
poisoning
by
lead
or
heroin
or
synthetic
narcotics
like
the
tees
and
blues
the
doubtful
part
of
his
proposition
is
that
human
wickedness
is
absolutely
a
public
health
problem
and
nothing
but
no
tragic
density
no
thickening
of
the
substance
of
the
soul
only
chemistry
or
physiology
i
ca
nt
bring
myself
to
go
with
this
medical
point
of
view
whether
it
applies
to
murderers
or
to
geniuses
at
one
end
of
the
scale
is
spofford
mitchell
did
he
rape
and
murder
a
woman
because
he
put
flakes
of
lead
paint
in
his
mouth
when
he
was
an
infant
at
the
other
end
are
beethoven
and
nietzsche
great
because
they
had
syphilis
the
twentieth
century
faustus
believed
this
so
completely
that
for
the
sake
of
his
art
he
would
nt
have
his
lesions
treated
and
the
spirochete
gave
him
his
awful
masterpieces
as
a
reward
you
d
call
that
kind
of
medical
interpretation
itself
sclerosis
or
lead
vlada
followed
this
where
beech
sees
poison
lead
i
hold
of
the
material
world
may
put
us
into
a
case
as
heavy
as
lead
a
sarcophagus
which
nobody
will
even
have
the
art
to
paint
becomingly
the
end
of
philosophy
and
of
art
will
do
to
advanced
thought
what
flakes
of
lead
paint
or
leaded
exhaust
fumes
do
to
infants
which
of
these
do
you
think
will
bring
us
to
the
end
of
everything
so
that
s
how
you
understand
this
real
philosophy
not
the
groveling
stuff
the
universities
mainly
do
otherwise
i
remember
how
i
used
to
stare
at
mendeleev
s
chart
in
the
science
class
there
it
all
was
fe
cu
na
he
that
s
what
we
were
made
of
i
side
and
the
baptist
churches
hell
anybody
that
can
do
card
tricks
could
take
over
for
that
god
but
the
god
that
thought
up
the
churches
of
the
mormons
pearson
shook
his
head
as
if
sorry
he
had
to
say
it
he
must
ve
come
down
here
from
pluto
well
i
imagine
the
mormons
do
a
great
deal
of
good
in
the
world
mickelsson
said
glancing
toward
the
woods
sure
they
do
same
as
ants
and
bees
he
leaned
forward
and
after
a
moment
stood
up
i
suppose
they
re
all
right
he
said
somebody
thinks
he
knows
how
to
get
through
this
world
alive
i
take
off
my
hat
to
m
he
held
out
the
dowsing
rod
adjusting
his
grip
preparing
to
march
down
the
mountain
i
take
it
you
re
neither
a
mormon
nor
a
baptist
catholic
or
presbyterian
he
added
pearson
turned
to
stare
at
him
i
m
a
witch
he
said
they
did
nt
tell
you
that
mickelsson
stared
for
the
hundredth
time
uncertain
whether
or
not
he
was
having
his
leg
pulled
i
guess
i
heard
there
were
one
or
two
of
those
around
he
said
carefully
not
giving
pearson
the
satisfaction
of
a
questioning
look
pearson
nodded
soberly
staring
down
at
the
forked
stick
in
his
hands
if
he
d
been
teasing
the
mood
had
now
left
him
this
country
s
seen
it
all
he
sighed
and
slightly
shook
his
head
i
imagine
it
s
something
to
do
with
the
darkness
the
way
the
clouds
are
always
there
or
if
they
happen
to
break
for
a
half
a
day
it
s
like
a
miracle
he
raised
his
head
to
look
across
the
valley
people
joke
about
it
having
a
spell
on
it
this
country
specially
fahrm
people
but
it
does
have
i
always
thought
maybe
gaht
a
whole
lot
of
spells
on
it
layer
on
layer
of
em
clear
back
to
the
time
of
the
ice
age
prehistoric
animals
when
they
were
driven
owt
put
a
spell
on
it
indians
when
the
white
people
came
along
they
put
a
spell
on
it
then
the
pennsylvania
dutch
then
the
railroad
people
now
the
polish
and
italian
dairy
fahrmers
course
none
of
the
spells
do
a
thing
that
s
the
truth
of
it
ile
narrowed
his
eyes
to
slits
mountains
do
nt
care
he
said
they
re
like
a
old
lean
cow
they
give
you
what
they
can
and
if
it
ai
nt
enough
they
let
you
die
and
they
forget
you
maybe
dream
you
once
in
a
while
that
s
my
theory
bring
you
back
for
a
minute
like
the
spragues
down
there
there
s
more
life
in
the
place
than
you
d
think
the
old
man
s
mood
every
night
around
dusk
the
deer
come
out
great
big
herds
of
em
they
stand
up
there
grazing
almost
to
the
first
morning
light
yup
pearson
said
lotta
deer
all
right
bear
too
though
you
ll
never
see
em
plenty
of
skunks
too
them
you
will
see
owt
crawling
around
your
woodpile
lookin
for
bees
and
beetles
coons
possums
thousand
different
species
of
birds
rattlesnakes
mickelsson
said
hob
goblins
pearson
said
they
looked
at
each
other
as
if
reassessing
at
last
pearson
grinned
and
looked
away
it
was
dusk
when
pearson
finally
found
strong
water
or
claimed
he
had
right
beside
the
garden
fence
they
marked
the
place
with
a
stake
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
settle
up
the
dog
stood
just
outside
the
door
looking
abused
and
in
brief
consternation
mickelsson
wondered
if
by
country
manners
he
should
invite
the
dog
in
immediately
he
did
with
the
old
man
he
felt
foolish
a
problem
of
the
different
languages
they
spoke
no
doubt
every
word
and
gesture
half
foreign
while
he
was
writing
the
check
pearson
fingered
the
scraped
place
on
the
door
i
see
you
scratched
off
the
hex
sign
he
said
yes
mickelsson
said
you
think
it
was
a
bad
idea
pearson
shrugged
it
s
yore
howse
now
he
hung
his
rough
hands
on
the
bib
of
his
overalls
and
looked
into
the
livingroom
you
got
a
buckled
floor
he
said
i
do
nt
recall
seeing
that
before
i
ve
got
to
fix
that
if
i
can
figure
out
how
mickelsson
said
according
to
the
doc
there
s
a
spring
under
the
house
pearson
s
mouth
dropped
slowly
open
and
he
pointed
at
the
floor
as
if
imagining
it
was
he
who
was
having
his
leg
pulled
you
gaht
a
spring
he
said
that
s
what
i
was
told
mickelsson
said
well
i
ll
be
damned
pearson
said
he
pointed
toward
the
kitchen
door
and
the
darkness
beyond
you
got
a
spring
right
there
under
the
floor
and
i
spent
half
the
afternoon
owt
there
wandering
around
in
the
weeds
with
a
stick
jesus
mickelsson
said
dawn
breaking
pearson
s
eyes
widened
and
then
suddenly
both
of
them
were
laughing
the
old
man
s
normally
gray
face
darkened
and
he
laughed
as
if
he
could
barely
get
his
breath
mickelsson
leaned
on
the
refrigerator
shaking
jehoshaphat
the
old
man
said
clacking
his
false
teeth
mickelsson
bent
over
ile
brought
out
talk
about
city
slickers
lord
i
should
charge
yott
triple
pearson
roared
i
told
you
i
ve
been
away
from
the
farm
a
long
time
mickelsson
said
long
time
is
right
he
drew
back
now
both
of
them
pearson
said
if
it
was
anybody
else
i
d
say
you
owed
me
a
drink
good
idea
mickelsson
said
and
with
one
more
whinny
wiping
his
eyes
went
over
to
the
cupboard
for
glasses
they
drank
in
the
kitchen
mickelsson
unable
to
figure
out
whether
or
not
it
would
be
right
to
invite
the
old
man
into
the
livingroom
craziest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
the
old
man
said
and
they
laughed
again
sometime
into
their
second
drink
mickelsson
asked
by
the
way
how
s
your
wife
etta
ruth
died
pearson
said
happened
three
weeks
ago
wensdee
mickelsson
set
down
his
glass
i
m
sorry
and
from
our
room
i
heard
men
and
shouts
and
slamming
doors
and
sometimes
glass
breaking
i
never
saw
this
crowd
though
i
was
often
woken
by
it
by
tramping
feet
and
songs
and
screams
in
the
morning
everything
was
quiet
the
only
person
around
was
an
old
woman
with
a
broom
sweeping
the
mess
into
a
pile
and
taking
it
away
in
a
bucket
the
manager
of
this
hotel
was
an
italian
named
tosco
he
wore
a
silver
bracelet
and
pinched
our
faces
too
hard
he
had
once
lived
in
new
york
he
said
it
was
like
hell
father
said
i
know
just
what
you
mean
tosco
liked
honduras
anything
you
wanted
here
he
said
what
s
the
president
like
father
asked
he
is
the
same
as
mussolini
tosco
said
this
name
darkened
father
s
face
and
with
the
shadow
of
the
word
still
on
it
he
said
and
what
was
mussolini
like
tosco
said
tough
strong
no
fooling
he
made
a
fist
and
shook
it
under
father
s
chin
like
this
then
he
d
better
keep
out
of
my
way
father
said
father
spent
part
of
every
day
in
town
and
while
he
was
there
mother
gave
us
lessons
on
the
beach
under
thundery
skies
it
was
like
play
she
wrote
with
a
stick
on
the
damp
sand
setting
us
arithmetic
problems
to
solve
or
words
to
spell
she
taught
us
the
different
kinds
of
cloud
formation
if
we
chanced
upon
a
dead
fish
she
poked
it
apart
and
named
each
piece
there
were
flowers
growing
beneath
the
palms
parts
in
the
blossoms
back
in
hatfield
we
had
studied
indoors
to
avoid
the
truant
officer
but
i
preferred
these
outdoor
lessons
studying
whatever
we
happened
to
find
on
the
beach
she
was
not
like
father
father
lectured
us
but
she
never
made
speeches
when
he
was
around
she
gave
him
her
full
attention
but
when
he
was
in
town
she
was
ours
she
answered
all
our
questions
even
the
silliest
ones
such
as
where
does
sand
come
from
and
how
do
fish
breathe
usually
when
we
returned
to
the
gardenia
father
was
on
the
piazza
with
someone
from
town
this
is
mr
haddy
he
would
say
he
s
a
real
old
coaster
and
the
prune
skinned
man
would
rise
and
creakily
greet
us
there
was
nothing
juanita
shumbo
did
nt
know
about
rearing
turkeys
she
was
an
old
black
woman
with
red
eyes
mr
sanchez
had
splashed
up
and
down
the
patuca
he
was
tiny
and
brown
and
had
a
father
said
and
he
made
that
man
sneeze
a
zambu
salutation
there
were
many
others
and
each
of
them
listened
closely
to
father
they
were
respectful
and
seemed
sitting
nervously
on
their
chair
seats
out
of
the
sun
to
regard
him
with
admiration
he
s
wonderful
with
strangers
mother
said
but
the
strangers
made
me
uneasy
for
i
had
no
clear
idea
of
father
s
plans
or
how
these
people
fitted
in
i
wished
i
had
father
s
courage
lacking
it
i
clung
to
him
and
mother
for
everything
i
had
known
that
was
comfortable
had
been
taken
away
from
me
the
other
kids
were
too
young
to
realize
how
far
we
had
drifted
from
home
except
for
the
unicorn
still
at
the
pier
the
past
had
been
wiped
away
coming
back
from
the
beach
one
afternoon
we
saw
tosco
at
the
hotel
talking
to
his
chevrolet
he
asked
it
questions
and
called
it
improper
names
he
stood
near
its
radiator
grill
and
shouted
and
cuffed
she
stupid
he
said
wagging
his
foot
in
pain
she
no
want
to
go
she
hate
me
my
husband
will
fix
it
and
that
evening
with
one
of
his
new
friends
it
was
mr
haddy
father
did
fix
it
he
said
machines
had
bodies
but
no
brains
mr
haddy
stared
as
if
father
had
said
something
wise
tosco
was
so
grateful
for
the
repair
work
he
said
we
could
use
the
car
anytime
we
liked
the
next
day
mother
said
she
wanted
to
take
us
for
a
drive
while
father
was
occupied
in
town
were
we
going
to
tela
tosco
asked
no
mother
said
we
were
going
east
toward
trujillo
tosco
laughed
he
said
you
will
come
back
soon
and
gave
mother
the
keys
which
road
do
i
take
he
said
there
is
only
one
we
drove
through
town
and
at
once
i
could
see
that
it
was
both
chicken
huts
like
the
shacks
on
the
beach
but
also
large
houses
and
green
lawns
the
best
of
them
were
surrounded
by
fences
that
was
the
strangest
thing
to
me
because
the
connecticut
valley
was
a
land
without
fences
except
for
horses
and
cows
it
reminded
me
of
what
captain
smalls
had
said
about
honduras
being
like
a
zoo
only
the
animals
were
outside
and
the
people
inside
the
cages
but
so
far
we
were
outside
from
this
town
road
we
came
to
the
flat
main
road
and
turned
left
we
went
less
than
half
a
mile
before
the
road
became
rutted
and
filled
with
broken
rocks
ahead
was
a
bridge
across
a
river
it
was
a
railway
bridge
but
there
was
no
other
cars
took
turns
using
it
mother
waited
and
then
drove
along
the
planks
and
railway
tracks
of
this
girder
bridge
below
us
women
were
washing
clothes
in
the
cocoa
colored
river
beyond
the
bridge
the
road
gave
out
entirely
it
was
a
wide
mud
puddle
that
and
finally
not
a
road
at
all
but
a
dry
creek
bed
in
which
the
rocks
were
higher
than
our
front
bumper
this
is
the
end
of
the
line
mother
said
we
were
a
mile
from
the
gardenia
we
tried
other
roads
one
ended
at
the
beach
another
at
a
riverbank
the
same
riverbank
as
before
and
a
third
became
a
quarry
which
was
part
of
a
mountain
at
the
end
of
two
of
those
roads
skinny
barking
dogs
jumped
at
our
windows
it
was
a
town
of
dead
ends
i
m
not
they
lashed
it
together
with
spare
reepschnur
cord
and
pushed
it
from
the
rocks
into
the
water
never
to
see
it
again
for
it
went
down
like
heavy
chain
then
they
started
to
swim
the
sun
was
setting
but
they
had
decided
to
get
wet
anyway
and
build
a
big
fire
on
the
other
side
since
there
was
plenty
of
montana
balsam
all
around
jesse
said
it
would
nt
burn
which
assured
hardesty
of
a
comfortable
blaze
by
which
to
warm
himself
wrapping
their
clothes
in
bundles
to
put
on
across
the
water
knapsacks
balanced
on
their
shoulders
in
theory
only
the
bottom
of
the
packs
would
get
wet
but
that
theory
lasted
only
for
the
ten
minutes
that
they
could
swim
fast
then
at
the
center
of
the
lake
they
sank
deeper
into
the
water
and
everything
got
drenched
the
water
there
was
as
cold
as
a
mountain
stream
at
midnight
on
the
last
day
of
january
the
colder
they
got
the
faster
jesse
talked
in
what
sounded
like
a
high
speed
collision
between
a
physics
textbook
and
a
politician
i
know
this
may
sound
like
an
excuse
he
said
but
tensor
functions
in
higher
differential
topology
as
exemplified
by
application
of
the
gauss
bonnet
theorem
to
todd
polynomials
indicate
that
cohometric
axial
rotation
in
nonadiabatic
thermal
upwelling
can
by
random
inference
derived
from
translational
equilibrium
aggregates
array
in
obverse
transitional
order
the
thermodynamic
characteristics
of
a
transactional
plasma
undergoing
negative
entropy
conversions
why
do
nt
you
just
shut
up
said
hardesty
jesse
did
nt
open
clothes
near
their
fire
collapsed
and
his
purple
knickers
burned
up
from
that
time
forward
he
went
bare
below
the
waist
except
for
a
new
guinea
style
penis
shield
that
he
fashioned
from
a
discarded
dr
pepper
can
and
hung
from
his
waist
on
a
piece
of
reepschnur
he
soon
took
to
extolling
this
form
of
dress
as
if
he
were
a
seventh
avenue
designer
introducing
a
new
line
it
s
very
comfortable
he
said
you
should
try
it
two
hours
after
the
fire
burned
out
a
thundering
mass
of
steel
wheels
and
coughing
diesels
swung
by
the
lakeshore
and
jesse
and
hardesty
found
a
comfortable
flatcar
to
carry
them
toward
yellowstone
hardesty
got
up
first
and
jesse
ran
by
the
side
of
the
tracks
flagging
dangerously
until
hardesty
hoisted
him
aboard
hardesty
was
easily
able
to
see
him
because
his
buttocks
shone
in
the
light
of
the
moon
twenty
four
hours
later
they
jumped
off
the
train
rather
than
ride
north
into
montana
and
canada
walked
for
a
was
the
yellowstone
river
hardesty
looked
up
at
the
sky
which
seemed
to
be
threatening
rain
why
do
nt
we
build
a
shelter
and
see
what
we
can
do
about
crossing
this
river
tomorrow
he
said
i
think
it
s
going
to
rain
rain
you
think
that
looks
like
rain
jesse
asked
obviously
you
never
were
in
the
mountains
for
very
long
i
know
that
it
ca
nt
rain
do
you
know
what
infallibility
is
i
ll
tell
you
it
s
me
predicting
the
weather
he
glanced
at
the
huge
cumulonimbus
clouds
rolling
toward
them
from
the
north
in
a
mountain
like
wall
that
shredded
up
the
moonlight
that
s
going
to
pass
in
five
minutes
tonight
will
be
pure
velvet
stretch
out
on
the
pine
needles
and
sleep
i
do
nt
know
hardesty
said
wary
of
the
clouds
trust
me
half
an
hour
after
they
had
fallen
asleep
a
crack
of
thunder
lying
and
turned
them
over
like
flapjacks
lightning
struck
in
machine
gun
reports
felling
trees
the
river
which
had
already
been
a
whipping
dashing
flume
was
now
so
fast
and
white
that
it
looked
like
a
streak
of
lightning
itself
and
the
rain
that
came
down
was
not
ordinary
rain
that
falls
in
inoffensive
drops
hardesty
and
jesse
tried
as
best
they
could
not
to
drown
follow
me
jesse
said
through
a
mouthful
of
water
what
for
i
know
where
there
s
shelter
i
saw
it
on
the
way
in
they
swam
uphill
for
a
few
hundred
yards
until
they
got
to
the
entrance
of
a
cave
i
do
nt
want
to
go
in
there
hardesty
proclaimed
although
he
knew
he
would
go
in
why
not
it
s
perfectly
safe
i
ve
always
hated
caves
i
guess
it
s
because
i
m
italian
come
on
i
ve
been
in
this
cave
before
i
think
if
and
he
left
a
couple
of
nice
feather
beds
supplies
furniture
and
lamps
sure
hardesty
said
as
darkness
swallowed
them
up
why
do
we
have
to
go
in
so
far
to
get
to
the
hermit
s
place
what
about
bats
there
are
nt
any
bats
west
of
the
platte
that
s
not
true
i
ve
seen
bats
in
san
francisco
or
east
of
fresno
after
twenty
minutes
of
groping
along
dark
paths
in
a
hissing
subworld
of
hidden
streams
and
mocking
echoes
they
came
to
what
they
sensed
was
a
great
chamber
for
the
sounds
of
their
footsteps
fled
away
from
them
as
if
into
the
open
air
they
felt
vast
space
above
and
to
the
sides
and
no
matter
which
way
they
walked
they
found
no
walls
but
only
level
floor
of
rock
and
earth
they
crossed
small
well
behaved
streams
as
warm
as
bathwater
and
saw
in
them
glowing
chains
of
phosphorescent
creatures
how
own
light
blinking
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
in
busy
silent
codes
they
seemed
like
an
army
of
dedicated
workers
absorbed
in
preparations
for
an
unspecified
journey
batteries
of
little
lights
that
racked
up
billions
upon
billions
of
permutations
and
combinations
seemed
to
be
driving
unhindered
toward
some
mysterious
goal
for
hours
or
perhaps
days
hardesty
and
his
guide
wandered
on
the
plain
of
lighted
streams
jesse
completely
forgot
about
the
hermit
s
place
all
they
cared
for
was
the
color
the
endless
map
of
calculating
rivulets
and
the
routes
of
tranquillity
and
silence
that
they
followed
into
pitch
black
emptiness
like
musical
tones
the
streams
mixed
and
separated
hardesty
and
you
did
nt
see
him
when
you
regained
consciousness
after
the
events
at
the
bridge
no
i
did
nt
you
do
nt
know
where
he
went
no
sir
neither
does
rome
added
the
undersecretary
quietly
pointedly
i
learned
that
an
italian
soldier
was
hit
by
a
truck
and
was
pretty
badly
mangled
screaming
his
head
off
someone
said
he
had
blond
hair
so
i
figured
it
was
ricci
and
a
man
came
out
of
the
woods
someone
with
a
gash
in
his
head
put
the
soldier
in
a
car
and
drove
him
away
how
did
you
learn
this
i
asked
questions
a
lot
of
questions
after
i
got
first
aid
that
was
my
job
sir
it
was
a
madhouse
up
there
italians
and
french
yelling
all
over
the
place
but
i
did
nt
leave
until
i
found
out
everything
you
re
to
be
commended
said
the
ambassador
thank
you
sir
let
s
assume
you
re
right
bradford
leaned
forward
the
blond
man
was
ricci
and
someone
with
a
head
wound
got
him
out
of
there
have
you
any
idea
who
that
someone
might
be
i
think
so
one
of
the
men
he
brought
with
him
the
other
was
killed
so
ricci
and
this
other
man
got
away
but
rome
has
nt
heard
from
ricci
would
you
say
that
s
normal
no
way
sir
it
s
not
normal
at
all
whenever
any
of
those
people
are
damaged
they
bleed
us
for
everything
they
can
get
and
they
do
nt
waste
time
about
it
our
policy
in
black
operations
is
clear
if
we
ca
nt
evacuate
the
wounded
i
think
we
understand
interrupted
halyard
an
old
soldier
s
antennae
picking
up
a
signal
couched
in
a
soldier
s
vocabulary
and
this
demolitions
expert
got
away
intact
they
d
have
reached
our
embassy
in
rome
as
quickly
as
they
could
yes
sir
with
their
hands
out
and
shouting
all
the
way
they
would
have
expected
attention
pronto
and
threatened
us
with
the
kind
we
do
nt
want
if
they
did
nt
get
it
what
do
you
think
happened
i
d
say
it
s
pretty
obvious
they
did
nt
make
it
what
was
that
asked
brooks
there
is
nt
any
other
explanation
i
know
those
people
sir
they
re
garbage
they
d
kill
their
mothers
if
the
price
was
right
they
would
have
been
in
touch
with
rome
believe
me
did
nt
make
it
repeated
halyard
staring
at
the
man
from
col
des
moulinets
what
do
you
mean
the
roads
sir
they
wind
up
and
down
those
mountains
like
corkscrews
sometimes
without
lights
for
miles
at
a
time
up
and
screaming
that
vehicle
s
a
candidate
for
a
long
fall
up
there
head
wounds
can
be
deceptive
halyard
commented
a
bloody
nose
looks
a
hell
of
a
lot
worse
than
it
is
it
strikes
me
said
brooks
that
same
man
acted
with
considerable
presence
of
mind
amid
the
chaos
he
functioned
forgive
me
mr
ambassador
interrupted
bradford
his
voice
rising
slightly
but
deferentially
the
intrusion
was
not
a
breach
of
manners
but
a
signal
i
think
the
field
officer
s
point
is
well
taken
a
thorough
search
of
those
roads
will
undoubtedly
reveal
a
car
somewhere
at
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
brooks
exchanged
looks
with
the
man
from
state
the
signal
was
acknowledged
yes
of
course
realistically
there
is
no
other
explanation
just
one
or
two
more
points
and
we
re
finished
said
bradford
rearranging
his
papers
as
you
know
whatever
is
said
here
recording
devices
the
words
spoken
here
are
stored
only
in
our
memories
this
is
for
the
protection
of
all
of
us
not
just
you
so
feel
perfectly
free
to
speak
candidly
do
nt
try
to
soften
the
truth
we
re
in
the
same
boat
i
understand
sir
your
orders
with
regard
to
havelock
were
unequivocal
he
was
officially
classified
beyond
salvage
and
the
word
from
rome
was
to
terminate
with
extreme
prejudice
is
that
correct
yes
sir
in
other
words
he
was
to
be
executed
killed
at
col
des
moulinets
that
s
what
it
meant
and
you
received
those
instructions
from
the
senior
attache
consular
operations
rome
a
man
named
warren
harry
warren
yes
sir
i
was
in
constant
touch
with
him
waiting
for
the
determination
waiting
for
washington
to
give
it
to
him
how
could
you
be
certain
the
man
you
perplexed
as
if
the
question
were
foolish
though
the
man
who
asked
it
was
not
foolish
at
all
among
other
things
i
worked
with
harry
for
over
two
years
i
knew
his
voice
just
his
voice
and
the
number
in
rome
it
was
a
direct
line
to
the
embassy
s
radio
room
unlisted
and
very
classified
i
knew
that
too
did
it
occur
to
you
that
when
he
gave
you
your
final
instructions
he
might
have
been
doing
so
under
duress
against
his
will
no
sir
not
at
all
it
never
crossed
your
mind
if
that
had
been
the
case
he
would
have
told
me
with
a
gun
at
his
head
said
halyard
how
the
code
had
been
established
and
he
used
it
he
would
nt
have
if
there
d
been
anything
wrong
explain
that
please
said
brooks
what
code
that
originate
in
washington
they
re
referred
to
when
decisions
are
transmitted
that
way
you
know
the
authorization
s
there
without
naming
names
if
anything
had
been
wrong
harry
would
nt
have
used
the
code
and
i
would
have
known
something
was
nt
right
i
d
have
asked
for
it
and
he
would
have
given
me
a
different
one
he
did
nt
and
i
did
nt
he
used
the
correct
one
up
front
what
was
the
code
for
col
des
moulinets
asked
emory
bradford
ambiguity
sir
it
came
direct
from
cons
op
washington
and
will
be
listed
in
the
embassy
telephone
logs
classified
files
which
is
proof
of
authorization
said
bradford
making
a
statement
yes
sir
dates
times
and
origins
of
clearance
are
in
those
logs
bradford
held
up
an
eight
by
ten
inch
photograph
of
suit
before
it
had
been
impaled
but
where
was
harker
gone
another
one
just
gone
pascalli
and
fodor
were
out
on
the
loading
platform
looking
up
and
down
the
alleyway
all
that
screaming
jenny
said
stepping
up
beside
bryce
yet
there
s
no
blood
on
the
floor
or
on
the
suit
tal
whitman
scooped
up
several
expended
shell
casings
that
had
been
spat
out
by
the
submachine
gun
scores
of
them
littered
the
floor
the
brass
casings
gleamed
in
his
open
nt
see
many
slugs
looks
like
the
sergeant
hit
what
he
was
shooting
at
must
ve
scored
at
least
a
hundred
hits
maybe
two
hundred
how
many
rounds
are
in
one
of
those
big
magazines
general
copperfield
stared
at
the
shiny
casings
but
did
nt
answer
pascalli
and
fodor
came
back
in
from
the
loading
platform
and
pascalli
said
there
s
no
sign
of
him
out
there
sir
you
want
us
to
search
farther
along
the
alley
before
copperfield
could
respond
bryce
said
general
you
ve
got
to
write
off
sergeant
harker
painful
as
that
might
be
he
s
dead
do
nt
hold
out
any
hope
for
him
death
is
what
this
is
all
about
death
not
hostage
taking
not
terrorism
not
nerve
gas
there
s
nothing
halfway
about
this
we
re
playing
for
all
the
marbles
i
do
nt
know
exactly
what
the
hell
s
out
there
or
where
it
came
from
but
i
do
know
that
it
s
we
ca
nt
even
imagine
yet
driven
by
some
purpose
we
might
never
understand
the
moth
that
killed
stu
wargle
that
was
nt
even
the
true
appearance
of
this
thing
i
feel
it
the
moth
was
like
the
reanimation
of
wargle
s
body
when
he
went
after
lisa
in
the
restroom
it
was
a
bit
of
misdirection
sleight
of
hand
a
phantom
tal
said
using
the
word
that
copperfield
had
introduced
with
somewhat
different
meaning
a
phantom
yes
bryce
said
we
have
nt
yet
encountered
the
real
enemy
it
s
something
that
just
plain
likes
to
kill
it
can
kill
quickly
and
silently
the
way
it
took
jake
johnson
but
it
killed
harker
more
slowly
hurting
him
real
bad
making
him
scream
because
it
wanted
us
to
hear
those
screams
harker
s
murder
was
sort
of
like
what
you
said
about
t
it
was
a
demoralizer
this
thing
did
nt
carry
sergeant
harker
away
it
got
him
general
it
got
him
for
a
corpse
copperfield
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
but
the
voice
we
heard
it
was
your
man
jake
johnson
no
bryce
said
i
do
nt
think
it
really
was
jake
it
sounded
like
him
but
now
i
m
beginning
to
suspect
we
re
up
against
something
that
s
a
terrific
mimic
mimic
copperfield
said
jenny
looked
at
bryce
those
animal
sounds
on
the
telephone
yeah
the
cats
dogs
birds
rattlesnakes
the
crying
child
it
was
almost
like
a
performance
as
if
it
were
bragging
hey
look
what
i
can
do
look
how
clever
i
am
jake
johnson
s
voice
was
just
one
more
impersonation
in
its
repertoire
what
are
you
proposing
copperfield
asked
something
super
natural
no
this
is
real
then
what
put
a
name
to
it
copperfield
demanded
maybe
it
s
a
natural
mutation
or
even
something
that
came
out
of
a
genetic
engineering
lab
somewhere
you
know
anything
about
that
general
maybe
the
army
s
got
an
entire
goddamned
division
of
geneticists
creating
biological
fighting
machines
manmade
monsters
designed
to
slaughter
and
terrorize
creatures
stitched
together
from
the
dna
of
half
a
dozen
animals
take
some
of
the
genetic
structure
of
the
tarantula
and
combine
it
with
some
of
the
genetic
structure
of
the
crocodile
the
cobra
the
wasp
maybe
even
the
grizzly
bear
and
then
insert
the
genes
for
human
intelligence
just
for
the
hell
of
it
put
it
all
in
a
test
tube
incubate
it
nurture
it
what
would
you
get
what
would
it
look
like
do
i
sound
like
a
raving
lunatic
for
even
proposing
such
a
thing
frankenstein
with
a
modem
twist
have
they
actually
gone
that
far
with
recombinant
dna
research
maybe
i
should
nt
even
have
ruled
out
the
supernatural
what
i
m
trying
to
say
general
is
that
it
could
be
name
to
it
let
your
imagination
run
wild
general
no
matter
what
hideous
thing
you
conjure
up
we
ca
nt
rule
it
out
we
re
dealing
with
the
unknown
and
the
unknown
encompasses
all
our
nightmares
copperfield
stared
at
him
then
looked
up
at
sergeant
harker
s
suit
and
helmet
which
hung
from
the
meat
hook
he
turned
to
pascalli
and
fodor
we
wo
nt
search
the
alley
the
sheriff
is
probably
right
sergeant
harker
is
lost
and
there
s
nothing
we
can
do
for
him
for
the
fourth
time
since
copperfield
had
arrived
in
town
bryce
said
do
you
still
think
it
looks
as
if
we
re
dealing
with
just
a
simple
incident
of
cbw
chemical
or
biological
agents
might
be
involved
copperfield
said
as
you
observed
we
ca
nt
rule
out
anything
but
it
s
not
a
simple
case
you
re
right
about
that
sheriff
i
m
sorry
for
suggesting
you
were
only
hallucinating
and
theories
jenny
asked
well
copperfield
said
i
want
to
start
the
first
autopsy
and
pathology
tests
right
away
maybe
we
wo
nt
find
a
disease
or
a
nerve
gas
but
we
still
might
find
something
that
ll
give
us
a
clue
you
d
better
do
that
sir
tal
said
because
i
have
a
hunch
that
time
is
running
out
corporal
billy
velazquez
one
of
general
copperfield
s
support
troops
climbed
down
through
the
manhole
into
the
storm
drain
although
he
had
nt
exerted
himself
he
was
breathing
hard
because
he
was
scared
what
had
happened
to
sergeant
harker
the
others
had
come
back
looking
stunned
old
man
copperfield
said
harker
was
dead
he
said
they
were
nt
quite
sure
what
had
killed
sarge
but
they
intended
to
find
out
man
that
was
bullshit
they
must
know
what
the
price
it
is
not
always
like
that
said
menenhetet
indeed
the
night
was
unusual
ptah
nem
hotep
said
perhaps
our
good
menenhetet
also
takes
pleasure
from
the
recollection
one
must
said
menenhetet
he
shrugged
in
the
morning
i
kissed
that
poor
thief
again
and
sent
him
limping
back
to
megiddo
and
worked
the
horses
toward
tyre
i
was
over
the
worst
of
the
mountains
and
it
was
a
quick
trip
down
too
quick
coming
out
of
one
of
the
ravines
we
were
going
fast
around
a
turn
hit
a
rock
and
spilled
i
went
leaping
off
the
road
but
landed
on
my
feet
with
heel
the
horses
were
screaming
in
their
traces
and
the
shaft
that
goes
from
their
harness
to
the
cart
had
split
at
the
fastening
in
my
pouch
i
had
two
hardwood
spikes
and
leather
thongs
but
still
lost
half
the
day
let
me
say
i
was
no
carpenter
by
the
time
mu
and
ta
were
harnessed
again
the
sun
was
overhead
what
a
ride
was
ahead
of
me
the
road
became
no
smoother
and
the
chariot
groaned
through
every
one
of
its
fastenings
i
did
not
know
if
i
could
get
it
all
the
way
to
tyre
and
hardly
knew
why
i
wanted
to
at
this
point
it
would
be
faster
to
travel
m
one
horse
with
my
weapons
on
the
other
but
then
no
charioteer
wants
to
lose
his
cart
mine
of
course
had
little
to
distinguish
it
just
a
wood
wagon
still
it
had
the
lines
of
a
chariot
so
my
sense
of
what
was
proper
did
not
suffer
while
only
a
few
specks
of
paint
still
stuck
those
thongs
around
the
shaft
as
though
it
was
waiting
to
fall
apart
again
i
liked
it
enough
to
laugh
for
my
own
post
was
sore
at
its
root
better
you
than
me
old
soldier
i
said
to
the
chariot
and
we
went
on
the
road
dipped
it
climbed
it
turned
but
the
forest
began
to
open
into
fields
and
around
a
knoll
i
could
look
down
through
the
ravines
to
the
sea
there
was
air
in
my
lungs
of
a
sort
i
had
never
breathed
before
not
even
on
the
delta
a
smell
it
had
to
be
of
the
very
green
itself
and
wholly
composed
of
fish
with
an
odor
refreshing
to
my
nose
not
like
the
fish
that
rotted
on
the
mud
flats
of
the
nile
no
this
good
smell
that
came
up
into
the
hills
from
the
loveliness
of
the
very
green
was
amazing
to
me
as
clean
as
if
i
were
breathing
the
very
scent
of
nut
when
she
holds
up
the
that
gets
into
the
sweat
of
men
and
some
women
i
began
to
cry
because
i
had
never
known
a
lady
like
that
i
do
not
mean
that
i
wept
like
a
child
nor
in
weakness
but
with
a
healthy
longing
now
that
my
pride
because
of
what
i
had
done
to
the
thief
felt
much
restored
besides
the
water
went
out
to
a
great
distance
extending
beyond
the
strength
of
my
eyes
until
i
could
not
find
the
place
where
the
sky
overhead
came
down
to
meet
the
sea
and
that
was
part
of
why
i
wept
as
if
a
sight
of
the
greatest
beauty
was
being
withheld
from
me
then
there
were
the
ships
i
was
used
to
our
own
sailboats
on
the
river
and
the
royal
barks
with
their
huge
red
and
purple
sailcloth
and
their
gold
and
silver
hulls
that
gave
more
show
of
our
great
wealth
than
watching
a
royal
procession
but
these
boats
here
on
the
very
green
so
far
away
i
could
not
even
see
the
color
of
their
a
sight
i
had
never
known
before
they
rode
through
long
curves
of
water
that
almost
buried
them
and
their
sails
spread
out
like
the
wings
of
white
butterflies
i
could
not
believe
how
many
i
saw
and
some
by
their
direction
were
rowing
away
from
tyre
and
some
were
sailing
to
it
although
as
i
descended
i
could
not
see
tyre
itself
only
the
stones
by
the
shore
now
riding
by
the
rocky
coast
the
road
would
sometimes
climb
over
a
spur
of
mountain
that
moved
right
into
the
sea
like
an
arm
in
front
of
your
nose
and
sometimes
our
wheels
would
wobble
along
a
trail
that
almost
came
down
to
the
rocks
of
the
sea
and
these
low
roads
were
wet
i
had
never
before
seen
such
streams
of
water
to
come
at
you
the
sea
was
like
a
serpent
rolling
down
a
hill
if
a
serpent
were
to
do
such
then
smashing
on
the
rocks
i
was
covered
with
spray
from
the
very
green
and
what
a
taste
it
devils
that
live
in
shells
and
something
mysterious
as
well
maybe
it
was
the
smell
of
everything
i
did
not
know
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
feel
of
the
very
green
as
it
sprayed
on
me
still
had
much
to
do
with
a
lady
for
it
was
also
light
and
contemptuous
and
playful
but
could
leave
you
chilled
then
it
grew
dark
and
i
realized
there
were
many
gods
and
goddesses
in
this
sea
and
their
feelings
could
shift
certainly
the
serpents
that
rose
from
the
water
now
smashed
with
more
force
on
the
shore
and
left
a
noise
like
thunder
the
spray
began
to
sting
my
eyes
i
was
happy
to
climb
a
hill
that
lifted
me
above
such
spite
but
realized
even
as
i
got
out
of
the
chariot
to
lift
the
wheels
from
one
smooth
bump
to
the
next
that
here
the
hill
was
of
solid
rock
and
workmen
back
so
long
ago
as
thutmose
the
third
or
was
it
nearer
to
the
beginning
with
khufu
must
have
labored
for
years
it
was
truly
a
stairway
and
would
have
impressed
me
more
if
not
for
our
egyptian
works
that
are
so
much
greater
still
i
learned
another
truth
about
the
sea
for
in
the
dark
hot
little
room
with
two
fans
one
of
which
does
nt
work
and
george
westrum
manages
to
find
the
only
place
where
the
working
fan
stirs
any
air
courage
she
told
him
it
s
only
half
past
seven
except
where
is
everyone
two
doors
opened
simultaneously
george
westrum
emerged
from
his
and
iris
from
hers
they
smiled
greeted
each
other
and
walked
together
toward
them
jenny
came
next
followed
by
joe
forbes
and
then
peter
hurried
out
looking
surprisingly
fresh
and
bright
eyed
they
sat
or
sprawled
under
the
grapes
their
conversation
desultory
and
idle
as
they
waited
for
mr
li
he
joined
them
looking
both
serious
and
somewhat
anxious
so
that
their
greetings
did
not
extract
from
him
his
usual
beaming
smile
what
s
up
for
today
asked
forbes
mr
li
nodded
we
spend
morning

visit
the
thousand
buddha
caves
also
an
ancient
tomb
and
following
lunch
we
look
forward
to
jiaohe
ancient
city
and
then
return
to
urumchi
he
hesitated
and
then
turned
to
look
at
peter
you
were
not
in
your
room
last
night
mr
fox
mrs
pollifax
s
heart
skipped
a
beat
oh
dear
she
thought
in
dismay
i
beg
your
pardon
peter
said
coldly
you
were
not
in
your
room
all
night
mr
li
repeated
firmly
and
how
the
hell
would
you
know
that
asked
peter
rallying
while
the
others
listened
in
astonishment
because
i
looked
in
there
are
no
keys
as
you
know
i
looked
in
and
went
back
many
times
to
look
you
were
not
in
your
room
all
night
mrs
pollifax
thought
i
ve
got
to
stop
this
i
ve
got
to
think
of
something
i
do
nt
know
what
business
it
is
of
yours
peter
told
china
travel
bureau
he
said
formally
i
am
responsible
you
were
not
in
your
room
you
were
not
anywhere
in
this
compound
i
have
to
ask
where
did
you
go
they
had
all
frozen
into
a
tableau
staring
mesmerized
at
mrs
pollifax
on
ire
china
stationpeter
who
stared
back
at
mr
li
they
had
been
made
uncomfortable
by
some
unknown
quality
in
mr
li
s
voice
and
by
the
rising
suspense
of
a
long
silence
that
iris
broke
at
last
by
speaking
actually
said
iris
in
a
calm
voice
peter
spent
the
night
with
me
in
my
room
all
night
every
head
swiveled
toward
iris
and
george
westrum
gasped
mrs
pollifax
looked
quickly
at
iris
and
then
her
glance
moved
to
george
who
was
staring
incredulously
at
iris
his
mouth
open
she
saw
that
his
face
had
turned
white
as
if
he
d
been
struck
how
strange
this
is
thought
mrs
pollifax
all
of
us
simply
sitting
here
and
watching
s
quite
true
she
said
with
a
lift
of
her
jaw
he
was
with
me
george
leaned
forward
his
eyes
cold
with
anger
and
disgust
you
slut
he
said
biting
the
words
through
his
teeth
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stalked
out
of
the
arbor
his
back
rigid
his
words
seemed
to
reverberate
or
was
it
the
hate
behind
them
wondered
mrs
pollifax
oh
those
tight
thin
lips
she
thought
this
had
been
there
all
the
time
even
mr
li
looked
stricken
in
an
embarrassed
voice
he
said
to
peter
if
that
is
i
did
nt
malcolm
said
pleasantly
surely
it
s
time
for
breakfast
now
do
nt
you
think
he
stood
and
walked
across
the
arbor
to
stand
casually
behind
iris
chair
and
mrs
pollifax
loved
him
for
this
iris
herself
sat
very
still
a
flush
on
either
cheekbone
her
head
high
yes
indeed
said
joe
forbes
as
his
feet
lis
looked
around
her
face
without
expression
her
glance
resting
lightly
on
mrs
pollifax
and
then
she
too
stood
up
jenny
staring
at
her
said
well
of
all
the
mrs
pollifax
heard
herself
say
firmly
i
think
we
ve
had
enough
jenny
gave
her
a
hostile
glare
and
turned
to
joe
forbes
poor
george
she
said
dramatically
mrs
pollifax
on
ire
china
station
poor
jenny
he
said
lightly
it
was
the
first
evidence
that
he
d
given
of
being
aware
of
the
shifting
alliances
they
moved
across
the
compound
in
procession
malcolm
walking
silently
beside
iris
joe
forbes
and
jenny
with
mr
li
peter
falling
in
at
the
rear
with
mrs
pollifax
said
in
a
low
voice
i
m
in
shock
accept
accept
she
murmured
but
why
did
she
do
it
i
do
nt
know
she
told
him
s
becoming
terribly
important
that
we
talk
in
private
soon
i
think
there
could
be
more
shocks
ahead
where
s
sheng
ti
now
on
his
way
by
bus
to
urumchi
i
hope
i
suppose
you
mean
you
re
worried
about
what
sheng
told
us
that
we
were
followed
last
night
into
the
desert
yes
he
said
with
a
frown
you
realize
we
have
only
sheng
s
word
for
that
do
nt
you
you
and
i
have
nt
seen
anyone
we
have
no
proof
he
could
have
made
it
up
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
followed
us
himself
possibly
she
conceded
but
in
any
case
he
added
his
face
lightening
tomorrow
s
the
day
for
visiting
the
kazakhs
up
in
the
grasslands
and
at
some
point
during
the
day
i
expect
to
vanish
which
will
take
care
of
anybody
s
lurking
curiosity
with
this
confident
statement
he
held
the
screen
door
open
for
her
to
enter
the
dining
spot
in
front
of
the
one
working
fan
he
did
not
join
them
at
all
for
breakfast
mrs
pollifax
with
dampened
towel
wrapped
around
her
head
forced
herself
to
concentrate
on
sight
seeing
for
the
next
hours
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
decided
she
was
experiencing
a
sense
of
events
moving
inexorably
now
toward
their
conclusion
and
without
any
way
to
alter
or
color
them
that
word
inexorable
again
she
thought
with
a
shiver
x
was
hiding
in
his
cave
at
the
edge
of
the
tian
shan
mountains
while
sheng
ti
was
somehow
making
his
way
to
urumchi
armed
with
his
coveted
ill
but
they
seemed
far
far
away
the
lonesome
gods
then
walking
on
i
found
the
tracks
again
following
them
i
fell
down
and
when
i
got
up
from
the
sand
my
hands
were
bloody
from
the
gravel
there
were
other
older
tracks
i
was
on
some
kind
of
a
trail
and
it
seemed
to
dip
down
into
the
hotter
desert
but
beyond
were
the
mountains
my
tongue
was
dry
and
i
could
not
swallow
my
eyes
hurt
and
i
was
very
hot
i
wanted
to
lie
down
but
the
sand
was
like
a
hot
stove
for
a
time
there
was
a
sound
a
drumming
sound
and
then
it
became
the
sound
of
horses
and
i
turned
around
a
half
dozen
riders
were
coming
at
me
was
it
a
dream
my
eyes
blinked
slowly
and
i
frowned
trying
to
make
them
out
they
were
only
a
blur
against
the
shimmering
enormously
long
but
that
was
the
heat
waves
again
they
came
up
coming
out
of
the
heat
waves
and
the
dust
and
the
foremost
rider
had
a
wooden
leg
they
pulled
up
and
the
man
with
the
peg
leg
said
holy
jesus
it
s
verne
s
boy
he
dropped
from
the
saddle
amazingly
agile
and
held
his
water
bag
to
my
lips
a
sip
and
a
swallow
then
he
took
it
away
just
rinse
your
mouth
this
time
he
said

it
soak
in
a
mite
after
a
moment
he
said
where

from

your
pa
they

him
i
said

to

so
i
would
not
be
hurt
and
they
shot
him

up

the
yard
near
where
my
father
had
fallen
listening
to
the
receding
sound
of
their
horses
then
i
went

i
straightened

slowly
then
crawled
into
bed
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
i
lay
still
staring
into
the
darkness
above
me
somewhere
far
off
there
was
a
low
rumble
and
the
earth
seemed
to
shake
a
little

the
only

had
business
of
his
own
to
see
to
a
low
wind
moaned
around
the
eaves
and
sand
rattled
against
the
windows
and
ran
nervous
fingers
along
the
roof
miss
nesselrode
had
said
i
could
come
to
her
but
if
i
did
i
should
be
close
to
my
enemies
and
they

and
that
they
must
not

saw
the
tomcats
a
mile
aft
twin
dart
like
shapes
racing
before
trails
of
black
smoke
sunlight
glinted
off
one
canopy
and
it
almost
looked
like
the
flashes
of
a

the

screeched
fifty

overhead
the

trailed
sounding
just
like
explosions
shavrov
acted
entirely
on
his
combat
trained
instincts
he
jerked
back
on
his
stick
and
triggered
his
four
missiles
at
the
departing
american
fighters

what
did
you
do
the

jackson

jackson
threw
his
fighter
into
a
violent
evasive
turn
to
the
left
sanchez
broke
the
other
way
in
the
seat
behind
jackson
s
the
radar
intercept
officer
flipped
switches
to
activate
the
aircraft
s
defense
systems
as
the
tomcat
twisted
in
midair
a
series
of
flares
and
balloons
was
ejected
from
the
tail
section
each
an
infrared
or
radar
lure
for
the
pursuing
missiles
all
four
were
targeted
on
jackson
s
fighter
spade
is
clear
spade
is
clear
spade
you
still
have
four
birds
in
pursuit
the
voice
from
the
hawkeye
said
roger
jackson
was
surprised
at
how
calmly
he
took
it
the
tomcat
was
doing
over
eight
hundred
miles
per
hour
and
accelerating
he
wondered
how
much
range
the
atoll
had
his
rearward
looking
radar
warning
light
flicked
on
two
get
after
them
jackson
ordered
roger
lead
sanchez
swept
into
a
dove
at
the
retreating
soviet
fighters
when
jackson
turned
two
of
the
missiles
lost
lock
and
kept
going
straight
into
open
air
a
third
decoyed
into
hitting
a
flare
exploded
harmlessly
the
fourth
kept
its
infrared
seeker
head
on
spade
s
glowing
tail
pipes
and
bored
right
in
the
missile
struck
spade
at
the
base
of
its
starboard
rudder
fin
the
impact
tossed
the
fighter
completely
out
of
control
most
of
the
explosive
force
was
spent
as
the
missile
blasted
through
the
boron
surface
into
open
air
the
fin
was
blown
completely
off
along
with
the
right
side
stabilizer
the
left
fin
was
badly
holed
by
fragments
which
smashed
through
the
back
of
the
fighter
s
canopy
hitting
christiansen
s
helmet
the
right
engine
s
fire
warning
lights
came
on
at
once
jackson
heard
the
oomph
over
his
intercom
he
killed
every
engine
switch
on
the
right
side
and
activated
the
in
frame
fire
extinguisher
next
he
chopped
power
to
his
port
engine
still
on
afterburner
by
this
time
the
tomcat
was
to
low
speed
configuration
this
gave
jackson
aileron
control
and
he
worked
quickly
to
get
back
to
normal
attitude
his
altitude
was
four
thousand
feet
there
was
nt
much
time
okay
baby
he
coaxed
a
quick
burst
of
power
gave
him
back
aerodynamic
control
and
the
former
test
pilot
snapped
his
fighter
over
too
hard
it
went
through
two
complete
rolls
before
he
could
catch
it
in
level
flight
gotcha
you
with
me
chris
nothing
there
was
no
way
he
could
look
around
and
there
were
still
four
hostile
fighters
behind
him
spade
this
is
lead
roger
lead
sanchez
had
the
four
forgers
bore
sighted
they
had
just
fired
at
his
commander
hummer
on
hummer
the
controller
was
thinking
fast
the
forgers
were
holding
formation
and
there
was
a
lot
of
russian
chatter
on
the
radio
circuit

say

spade
spade

your
nine

the
officer
swore
and
looked
at
one
of
the
enlisted
men
he
worked
with
that
was
too
fast
sir
just
too
fuckin
fast
we
got
tapes
of
the
russkies
i
ca
nt
understand
it
but
it
sounds
like
kiev
is
right
pissed
they
re
not
the
only
ones
the
controller
said
wondering
if
he
had
done
the
right
thing
calling
spade
off
it
sure
as
hell
did
nt
feel
that
way
the
tomcats
sanchez
head
jerked
in

roger
breaking

a
savage
loop
where

negative
i
ve
tried
let
s
go
back
home
nothing
would
have
pleased
sanchez
more
than
to
blast
the
forgers
right
out
of
the
sky
and
with
his
four
missiles
he
could
have
done
this
easily
but
like
most
pilots
he
was
highly
disciplined

unless

i
do
nt
know
how
bad
it
took
an
hour
to
get
to
the
kennedy
jackson
s
fighter
flew
badly
would
not
hold
course
in
any
specific
attitude
he
had
to
adjust
trim
constantly
sanchez
reported
some
movement
in
the
aft
cockpit
maybe
it
was
just
the
intercom
shot
out
jackson
thought
hopefully
sanchez
was
ordered
to
land
jackson
on
the
final
approach
the
tomcat
started
to
handle
badly
the
pilot
struggled
with
his
fighter
planting
it
hard
on
the
deck
and
catching
the
number
one
wire
the
right
side
landing
gear
collapsed
at
once
and
the
thirty
million
dollar
fighter
orthopedic
man
in
new
york
but
they
had
only
stayed
for
two
days
and
that
was
important
this
time
mel
said
she
d
be
back
on
friday
afternoon
which
meant
four
days
away
they
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
she
was
going
but
she
insisted
that
there
was
a
problem
with
go
back
and
watch
them
edit
the
girls
were
still
amazed
when
they
went
back
to
the
beach
that
night
to
meet
some
friends
and
build
a
fire
but
raquel
eyed
her
shrewdly
as
they
cleared
the
table
it
s
serious
this
time
huh
mel
avoided
her
eyes
and
carried
a
stack
of
plates
into
the
kitchen
what
is
you
ca
nt
fool
me
you
got
a
new
man
that
s
not
true
at
all
the
man
is
a
subject
i
did
an
interview
with
but
she
could
nt
meet
raquel
s
eyes
and
she
knew
that
if
she
did
she
could
nt
convince
her
just
keep
an
eye
on
the
girls
while
i
m
gone
especially
val
i
notice
that
the
jacobs
boy
is
all
grown
up
and
drools
every
time
he
sees
her
he
wo
nt
do
no
harm
i
ll
watch
them
and
then
she
watched
mel
retreat
into
her
room
and
walked
into
the
certainly
no
mrs
hahn
but
she
was
a
sharp
old
woman
and
she
loved
them
and
on
tuesday
morning
mel
took
the
ferry
back
and
flew
from
boston
to
new
york
she
reached
the
house
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
which
gave
her
plenty
of
time
to
air
the
place
out
and
then
turn
the
air
conditioning
on
go
around
the
corner
to
buy
fresh
flowers
and
whatever
groceries
they
might
need
and
then
come
back
and
get
ready
to
meet
him
his
plane
was
nt
due
in
until
nine
and
she
left
for
the
airport
at
seven
thirty
to
be
cautious
which
was
just
as
well
because
the
traffic
was
heavy
and
cars
were
overheating
left
and
right
and
it
was
eight
forty
five
when
they
got
there
she
had
just
enough
time
to
check
the
gate
at
which
he
would
arrive
and
then
hurry
out
there
and
then
stand
tapping
her
foot
nervously
for
the
next
half
hour
as
they
were
fifteen
minutes
late
and
at
nine
fifteen
exactly
the
big
began
deplaning
she
stood
watching
intently
as
the
people
poured
off
with
california
tans
and
straw
hats
and
bare
golden
legs
and
silk
shirts
open
to
the
waist
with
gold
chains
and
then
suddenly
she
saw
a
man
who
looked
nothing
like
any
of
them
in
a
beige
linen
suit
and
a
blue
shirt
and
navy
tie
his
hair
only
slightly
bleached
from
the
sun
and
his
face
tan
but
there
was
a
serious
air
about
him
as
he
walked
toward
mel
and
looked
down
at
her
where
she
stood
and
then
without
further
ado
he
bent
to
kiss
her
they
stood
there
for
what
seemed
like
a
very
long
time
as
people
eddied
around
them
like
a
river
cascading
past
rocks
and
then
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
hello
how
was
the
flight
not
nearly
as
nice
as
this
he
grinned
and
with
that
they
walked
hand
in
hand
to
pick
up
his
baggage
and
then
went
to
hail
u
cab
but
time
their
way
out
of
the
airport
and
mel
wondered
how
she
had
ever
survived
without
him
you
look
wonderful
mel
she
had
a
deep
tan
which
set
off
her
green
eyes
and
copper
hair
and
she
had
worn
a
white
silk
dress
with
a
flower
in
her
hair
and
white
high
heeled
sandals
she
looked
summery
and
healthy
and
happy
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
drink
his
as
though
she
had
waited
for
him
for
a
lifetime
you
know
i
have
nt
been
to
new
york
in
years
he
looked
at
the
ugly
scenery
passing
by
as
they
drove
into
town
and
shook
his
head
i
always
turn
them
down
but
i
figured
this
time
he
shrugged
and
leaned
over
to
kiss
her
again
she
had
nt
expected
him
to
be
as
bold
or
herself
to
be
as
comfortable
with
it
but
the
endless
conversations
on
the
phone
seemed
to
have
given
them
an
ease
with
each
other
they
might
otherwise
not
have
had
they
had
it
felt
like
two
years
or
twice
that
i
m
glad
you
did
nt
turn
them
down
this
time
she
smiled
at
him
and
then
returned
her
gaze
to
the
road
are
you
hungry
not
very
for
him
it
was
only
quarter
to
seven
but
it
was
shortly
before
ten
in
new
york
i
ve
got
food
at
the
house
but
we
can
go
somewhere
for
a
bite
to
eat
if
you
like
whatever
makes
you
happy
he
could
nt
take
his
eyes
off
her
all
else
slipped
his
mind
as
he
reached
for
her
hand
i
m
so
happy
to
see
you
mel
it
almost
seemed
unreal
that
they
should
be
together
again
it
s
a
little
like
a
dream
is
nt
it
she
smiled
as
she
asked
it
is
best
dream
i
ve
had
in
years
they
fell
silent
again
as
they
drove
into
town
he
smiled
at
her
figured
i
owed
you
at
least
one
trip
east
after
all
you
ve
been
to
l
a
twice
but
still
he
had
needed
an
excuse
a
reason
to
come
he
had
nt
just
gotten
on
a
plane
and
come
to
see
her
but
it
was
easier
for
both
of
them
this
way
they
could
advance
toward
each
other
as
they
had
been
by
inches
the
president
s
certainly
made
a
remarkable
recovery
it
s
only
been
five
weeks
and
he
s
on
his
feet
and
in
the
office
a
few
hours
a
day
mel
shook
her
head
still
amazed
at
all
that
and
then
she
remembered
something
how
s
marie
by
the
way
fair
a
frown
crossed
his
face
but
he
shook
off
the
worry
i
left
two
other
men
in
charge
while
go
on
to
bed
beth
said
i
ve
got
a
key
did
you
say
you
were
partying
with
college
students
mrs
wheatley
said
from
the
university
yes
well
be
careful
what
you
smoke
honey
there
was
a
marvelous
feeling
across
beth
s
shoulders
and
on
the
back
of
her
neck
for
a
moment
she
wanted
to
rush
home
and
embrace
mrs
wheatley
and
hold
her
tight
but
all
she
said
was
okay
see
you
in
the
morning
mrs
wheatley
said
beth
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
listening
to
the
music
from
the
living
room
and
finished
her
beer
she
hardly
ever
listened
to
music
and
had
never
been
to
a
school
dance
if
you
did
nt
count
the
apple
pi
s
this
was
the
first
room
the
song
ended
a
moment
later
tim
sat
on
the
bed
beside
her
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
like
the
response
to
a
request
she
had
made
have
another
beer
he
said
she
took
it
and
drank
her
movements
felt
slow
and
certain
jesus
tim
whispered
in
mock
alarm
what
s
that
purple
thing
burning
there
you
tell
me
beth
said
she
panicked
for
a
moment
as
he
pushed
himself
into
her
it
seemed
frighteningly
big
and
she
felt
helpless
as
if
she
were
in
a
dentist
s
chair
but
that
did
nt
last
he
was
careful
and
it
did
nt
hurt
badly
she
put
her
arms
around
his
back
feeling
the
roughness
of
his
bulky
sweater
he
began
moving
he
began
to
squeeze
her
breasts
under
her
blouse
do
nt
do
that
she
said
and
he
said
whatever
you
say
and
kept
moving
in
and
out
she
could
right
she
was
seventeen
and
it
was
about
time
he
was
wearing
a
condom
the
best
part
had
been
watching
him
put
it
on
joking
about
it
what
they
were
doing
was
really
all
right
and
nothing
like
books
or
movies
fucking
well
now
if
only
he
were
townes
afterward
she
fell
asleep
on
the
bed
not
in
a
lovers
embrace
not
even
touching
the
man
she
had
just
made
love
with
but
sprawled
out
on
the
bed
with
her
clothes
on
she
saw
tim
blow
out
the
candle
and
heard
the
door
close
quietly
after
him
when
she
awoke
she
saw
by
the
electric
alarm
clock
that
it
was
nearly
ten
in
the
morning
sunlight
came
around
the
edges
of
the
bedroom
window
blinds
the
air
smelled
stale
her
legs
were
prickly
from
her
wool
skirt
and
the
neck
of
her
sweater
had
been
pressed
against
her
throat
which
felt
sweaty
she
was
ferociously
hungry
she
sat
on
the
edge
up
and
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
empty
bottles
and
beer
cans
were
everywhere
the
air
was
foul
with
dead
smoke
a
note
was
fastened
to
the
refrigerator
door
with
a
magnet
in
the
shape
of
mickey
mouse
s
head
it
read
everybody
went
to
cincinnati
to
see
a
movie
stay
as
long
as
you
like
the
bathroom
was
off
the
living
room
when
she
had
finished
showering
and
had
dried
herself
she
wrapped
a
towel
around
her
hair
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
opened
the
refrigerator
there
were
eggs
in
a
carton
two
cans
of
budweiser
and
some
pickles
on
the
door
shelf
was
a
baggie
she
picked
it
up
inside
was
a
single
tightly
rolled
joint
she
took
it
out
put
it
in
her
mouth
and
lit
it
with
a
wooden
match
she
inhaled
deeply
then
she
took
out
four
eggs
and
put
them
on
to
boil
she
had
never
felt
so
hungry
in
her
life
she
cleaned
up
the
apartment
in
an
organized
four
large
grocery
bags
to
put
all
the
bottles
and
butts
in
and
stacking
these
on
the
back
porch
she
found
a
half
full
bottle
of
ripple
and
four
unopened
beer
cans
in
the
debris
she
opened
a
beer
and
began
vacuuming
the
living
room
carpet
hanging
over
a
chair
in
the
bedroom
was
a
pair
of
jeans
when
she
had
finished
cleaning
she
changed
into
them
they
fit
her
perfectly
she
found
a
white
t
shirt
in
a
drawer
and
put
it
on
then
she
drank
the
rest
of
her
beer
and
opened
another
someone
had
left
a
lipstick
on
the
back
of
the
toilet
she
went
to
the
bathroom
and
studying
herself
in
the
mirror
reddened
her
lips
carefully
she
had
never
worn
lipstick
before
she
was
beginning
to
feel
very
good
mrs
wheatley

beth

she
said
at
noon
she
put
the
rest
of
the
eggs
in
a
pot
to
boil
and
turned
on
the
hi
fi
she
had
never
really
listened
to
music
before
but
she
listened
now
she
danced
a
few
steps
in
the
middle
of
the
living
room
waiting
for
the
eggs
she
would
and
drink
one
beer
or
one
glass
of
wine
every
hour
she
had
made
love
the
night
before
and
now
it
was
time
to
learn
about
being
drunk
she
was
alone
and
she
liked
it
it
was
the
way
she
had
learned
everything
important
in
her
life
at
four
in
the
afternoon
she
walked
into
larry
s
package
store
a
block
from
the
apartment
and
bought
a
fifth
of
ripple
when
the
man
was
putting
it
in
the
bag
she
said
do
you
have
a
wine
like
ripple
that
s
in
fear
and
agony
i
waited
for
the
class
to
be
over
jacob
finney
was
coming
by
for
me
with
my
horse
we
were
riding
out
to
the
tar
pits
along
the
old
indian
trail
as
i
gasped
oh
your
poor
face
what
happened
it
was
a
fight
i
think
there
will
be
another
now
rad
it
was
rad

nt
it
yes
he
should
be
ashamed
of
himself
picking
on
someone
smaller
than
himself
he
s
not
so
big
we
had
started
toward
the
door
but
as
i
stepped
back
to
allow
her
to
go
through
the
door
ahead
of
me
a
hand
grasped
my
shoulder
and
i
was
shoved
aside
rad
stepped
into
my
place
and
moved
up
beside
her
now
i
was
angry
out
in
the
yard
he
started
walking
away
beside
her
he
had
brushed
me
aside
as
if
i
were
nothing
inside
me
there
was
cold
fury
i
fought
it
down
what
s
the
matter
i
called
after
him
are
you
scared
he
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
around
they
all
did
even
mr
fraser
who
stopped
in
the
scared
of
you
he
put
down
his
books
and
started
toward
me
now
you
re
in
for
it
i
told
myself
do
nt
let
him
hit
you
wrestle
he
was
larger
in
every
way
and
much
heavier
but
how
much
did
he
know
he
had
his
fists
up
ready
to
strike
and
mine
were
up
too
then
suddenly
i
dove
grasping
his
ankle
with
both
hands
and
throwing
my
weight
against
his
knee
as
i
jerked
up
on
the
ankle
he
toppled
over
on
his
back
instantly
holding
his
ankle
in
my
right
armpit
i
stepped
across
his
body
half
turning
him
toward
the
ground
then
i
dropped
to
a
sitting
position
on
his
buttocks
lacing
the
opposite
way
the
indians
had
taught
me
this
and
i
knew
i
had
only
to
put
more
pressure
on
his
ankle
and
his
hip
would
be
dislocated
i
leaned
back
a
little
and
he
cried
out
fraser
had
alined
and
was
coming
toward
us
out
on
the
street

and
shock

for
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
said

place

oil
in
it
too

like

a
minute
or

buzzards

there
to
feed
on
the
ones
that
get
trapped
folks
hereabout
injuns

an
such
they
use
the
tar
on
their
roofs
use
it
to
watertight
their
boats
too
the
chumash
injuns
who
live
along
the
coast
they
used
it
first
the
chumash
make
mighty
fine
boats
some
carry
eight
to
ten
people
maybe
more
they
use
tar
along
the
seams
to
make
the
boats
watertight
they
used
to
go
out
to
the
islands
off
the
coast
to
catalina
santa
barbara
an
the
like
the
chumash
were
right
handy
with
boats
but
they
re
gettin
fewer
and
fewer
all
the
time
he
pointed
off
to
his
left
off
down
there
s
a
big
cienaga
down
there
and
just
spread
out
then
about
fifteen
years
ago
she
broke
through
to
the
sea
an
drained
most
of
that
still
mighty
good
grazing
land
green
grass
and
some
water
down
there
most
of
the
time
the
californios
have
some
of
their
roundups
down
thataway
this
trail
runs
all
the
way
to
the
sea
there
s
a
bay
along
there
santa
monica
bay
not
much
protection
though
in
bad
weather
she
s
too
open
miss
nesselrode
she
wants
you
to
know
the
country
around
and
the
folks
what
s
off
there
i
pointed
toward
the
mountains
there
s
the
mountains
and
over
beyond
a
wide
valley
the
pass
they
call
the
little
door
the
injun
name
is
cahuenga
there
s
trails
through
most
of
the
canyons
just
horse
trails
mostly
but
there
are
bears
back
in
there
lots
of
them
and
more
than
likely
they
wo
nt
get
out
of
the
way
in
of
there
less
you
want
to
fight
i
heard
there
were
bandits
oh
sure
plenty
of
those
some
just
steal
horses
some
raid
lonely
stations
murder
travelers
and
the
like
you
got
to
be
careful
the
day
was
warm
and
pleasant
all
around
us
was
a
wide
sweep
of
grassland
dotted
with
clumps
of
oak
and
other
brush
with
here
and
there
a
small
monster
why
was
mother
so
afraid
jase
longed
to
look
behind
her
eyes
but
he
never
had
before
oh
her
conscious
thoughts
now
and
then
but
nothing
deep
he
was
afraid
of
the
way
she
gnawed
her
hand
and
sat
slackfaced
in
the
chair
when
he
was
nt
home
and
knew
the
answer
to
every
question
he
asked
her
and
yet
never
seemed
interested
in
anything
he
was
afraid
instinctively
that
whatever
was
in
her
memories
he
did
not
want
to
know
it
for
he
experienced
other
people
s
memories
as
if
so
that
once
having
dwelt
in
their
minds
for
a
time
he
could
easily
become
confused
about
which
things
that
he
remembered
were
actually
things
that
he
had
done
many
hours
late
at
night
he
had
lain
in
his
bed
letting
his
mind
wander
searching
the
nearby
rooms
he
did
not
know
how
to
range
farther
than
that
with
his
listening
prowling
gift
no
one
suspected
his
intrusions
they
thought
their
thoughts
held
their
memories
dreamed
their
dreams
as
always
unaware
of
this
spectator
in
his
memory
jase
was
no
virgin
with
the
prurience
of
childhood
he
had
been
man
and
woman
in
acts
he
did
not
think
his
neighbors
had
imagination
enough
to
perform
in
memory
jase
had
beaten
his
children
killed
a
man
in
a
riot
on
a
lower
level
stolen
from
his
employer
quietly
sabotaged
the
electrical
system
all
the
most
memorable
painful
exhilarating
acts
of
the
people
whose
minds
he
entered
it
was
the
hardest
thing
about
the
swipe
remembering
when
he
awoke
and
which
things
not
he
did
not
want
his
mother
s
memories
to
have
such
force
upon
him
and
yet
she
was
too
afraid
still
gnawing
at
her
hand
there
at
the
table
waiting
for
the
commissary
to
send
them
supper
why
are
you
so
afraid
because
someone
has
accused
me
of
having
the
swipe
page
deleted
page
deleted
she
had
unleashed
another
swipe
upon
the
world
you
ca
nt
be
she
whispered
mother
to
son
that
s
the
only
way
there
must
be
other
gifts
in
the
world
jase
said
than
those
that
reside
in
x
chromosomes
only
showing
up
when
paired
with
a
stunted
y
suddenly
she
doubled
up
her
fist
and
brought
it
down
like
a
hammer
on
his
mouth
he
cried
out
in
pain
blood
from
his
lips
rushed
into
his
mouth
as
he
tried
to
shout
at
her
and
he
choked
mother
backed
away
from
him
whimpering
gnawing
on
the
hand
that
had
just
struck
him
mother
to
son
you
re
clean
you
re
clean
not
his
son
but
mine
not
his
but
mine
but
in
his
mother
s
mind
jason
saw
that
she
looked
at
him
with
the
same
eyes
that
had
seen
and
loved
her
husband
after
all
jason
had
homer
worthing
s
face
that
well
known
face
that
face
that
frightened
children
in
the
textbooks
in
school
he
was
younger
thicker
of
lip
gentler
in
the
eyes
but
he
still
wore
homer
s
face
and
his
mother
both
loved
and
hated
him
for
that
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
facing
the
door
and
jason
saw
that
she
was
seeing
homer
as
if
he
had
come
back
to
her
as
if
he
smiled
at
her
and
said
it
was
all
a
misunderstanding
and
i
ve
come
back
to
make
you
whole
again
jase
swallowed
the
blood
in
his
mouth
and
got
off
his
bed
walked
around
mother
and
stood
in
front
of
her
she
did
her
husband
and
he
reached
out
to
her
reached
out
and
touched
her
cheek
and
said
uyula
i
love
you
and
she
took
a
step
toward
him
into
his
embrace
mother
said
jason
she
shuddered
her
vision
cleared
and
she
saw
that
it
was
not
her
husband
she
held
but
her
son
and
his
mouth
was
bleeding
she
dissolved
into
sobs
clung
to
him
pulled
him
to
the
floor
and
wept
upon
him
touching
his
bleeding
lips
kissing
him
saying
over
and
over
i
m
sorry
i
m
so
sorry
you
were
ever
born
will
you
ever
forgive
me
i
forgive
you
jason
whispered
for
letting
me
be
born
mother
is
insane
said
jason
silently
she
is
insane
and
she
knows
i
have
the
swipe
and
if
they
interrogate
her
we
both
are
dead
he
had
to
go
to
school
the
next
day
if
he
stayed
away
he
come
to
his
home
where
they
would
find
uyul
who
was
nobody
except
homer
worthing
s
wife
uyul
the
monster
s
wife
that
was
the
name
he
found
inside
his
mother
s
head
i
wish
i
had
never
looked
he
thought
again
and
again
all
night
he
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
and
awoke
often
always
trying
to
think
of
a
solution
that
was
not
terrifyingly
desperate
go
into
hiding
become
a
wall
rat
he
did
not
know
how
the
people
with
uncoded
hands
survived
on
capitol
living
in
the
ventilation
shafts
and
stealing
whatever
they
could
no
he
would
have
to
go
to
school
face
it
down
they
had
no
proof
he
had
answered
the
question
himself
pretty
much
as
long
as
his
genes
did
nt
show
it
torrock
had
no
proof
that
he
was
a
swipe
so
he
left
his
mother
in
the
morning
and
dozed
in
the
worm
on
the
way
to
school
he
went
to
his
morning
classes
as
usual
ate
the
day
and
then
the
headmaster
came
and
invited
him
to
his
office
what
about
history
jase
asked
trying
to
act
unconcerned
the
rest
of
your
classes
today
are
cancelled
torrock
was
waiting
in
the
headmaster
s
office
he
looked
pleased
with
himself
we
have
prepared
a
test
it
s
no
more
difficult
than
the
one
you
took
yesterday
except
that
i
did
nt
write
the
questions
i
do
nt
know
the
answers
someone
will
be
with
you
all
the
time
if
you
could
perform
an
act
of
genius
yesterday
surely
you
can
do
it
again
today
jason
looked
at
the
headmaster
too
why
she
had
nt
told
him
she
knew
he
had
to
decide
for
himself
when
the
night
faded
to
shades
of
gray
he
and
a
small
recording
device
slung
on
his
belt
exhaustion
had
brought
its
own
kind
of
peace
spent
he
sank
down
at
the
foot
of
a
wide
beech
tree
near
the
clearing
the
first
glow
of
the
new
sun
began
to
color
the
hills
he
crushed
a
blade
of
grass
with
his
sore
fingers
rolling
it
between
them
inhaling
its
sharp
sweet
smell
it
was
good
to
be
alive
what
would
it
be
like
to
not
be
to
not
find
out
what
lay
beyond
the
next
day
to
not
see
thursday
to
never
slide
down
the
hills
of
april
a
rabbit
rustled
at
the
edge
of
the
blackberry
patch
nibbled
tentatively
at
a
blade
of
grass
thrust
cut
velvet
ears
in
his
direction
he
felt
pity
for
it
it
was
so
small
so
ephemeral
its
moments
fleeting
as
he
watched
but
it
had
to
be
what
it
was
he
reached
for
the
panpipes
and
blew
a
melody
in
a
minor
key
to
the
little
creature
it
was
a
theme
know
just
why
the
theme
seemed
important
to
him
but
somehow
it
did
somehow
it
told
him
of
the
end
of
things
and
of
beginnings
the
melody
hung
in
the
warm
sweet
air
for
a
moment
and
somehow
that
moment
seemed
a
bit
more
alive
to
him
then
the
ideas
the
variations
came
tumbling
out
of
his
panpipes
he
laughed
and
touched
the
tiny
recorder
slung
from
his
hip
and
in
his
mind
he
could
hear
the
orchestration
swelling
strings
then
the
theme
whispered
from
a
flute
answered
by
a
kleidelphone
echoed
by
the
dark
double
reeds
now
a
muttered
tympani
a
variation
by
weidner
horn
it
was
all
there
it
was
all
there
because
it
was
his
lot
to
create
and
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
was
outrageously
hungry
no
wonder
it
was
getting
late
it
was
time
for
him
to
tell
them
he
was
going
to
stay
at
renascence
but
only
if
they
d
give
him
breakfast
liss
had
said
to
him
he
had
taken
that
thought
and
turned
it
over
in
his
mind
and
accepted
it
it
was
a
lie
he
knew
that
now
david
began
to
shake
he
tried
to
control
it
but
as
he
tried
the
trembling
grew
worse
until
it
seemed
as
if
his
body
were
trying
to
fly
apart
trying
to
separate
itself
from
its
core
of
hurt
with
a
hand
that
barely
obeyed
he
threw
open
the
cabin
door
and
rushed
out
into
the
dimming
light
the
mountain
wilderness
pressed
in
around
him
making
him
feel
vulnerable
and
utterly
alone
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
he
d
felt
that
way
about
renascence
not
since
his
first
days
there
when
the
memories
of
vesta
were
fresh
he
looked
up
in
the
darkening
sky
a
satellite
skimmed
faintly
overhead
and
there
another
for
a
minute
his
thoughts
shot
out
of
him
projecting
him
into
the
sky
far
beyond
the
satellites
to
the
asteroid
he
d
once
called
home
back
to
the
little
boy
he
nt
any
use
that
little
boy
was
gone
dead
finished
it
was
nearly
dark
flicking
on
the
little
light
he
carried
on
his
belt
he
walked
on
along
the
familiar
paths
through
dark
woods
he
came
to
a
clearing
and
began
to
cut
across
the
grassy
meadow
something
moved
once
in
the
shadows
and
was
gone
he
found
the
fawn
near
the
soft
clay
banks
of
a
spring
run
a
bobcat
had
killed
it
the
cat
s
prints
lay
deep
in
the
beam
of
his
light
a
hemlock
branch
above
the
kill
bent
from
the
recent
weight
it
had
supported
the
cat
had
waited
watching
the
fawn
in
the
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
then
it
had
leaped
landing
on
the
little
deer
s
spine
paralyzing
it
with
sharp
claws
the
fawn
lay
warm
beside
him
its
guts
spilling
in
an
obscene
heap
by
his
feet
he
ran
his
hand
over
its
head
its
ears
he
whispered
does
everything
have
to
die
at
renascence
his
soul
and
left
it
as
ruined
as
the
young
deer
it
was
the
same
fawn
he
was
sure
the
one
he
d
seen
at
dawn
three
weeks
ago
leaving
it
he
stumbled
away
toward
the
spot
where
he
d
waited
alone
that
morning
he
felt
a
grim
satisfaction
that
the
bobcat
would
go
hungry
while
he
was
there
it
would
nt
dare
come
back
to
its
meal
while
a
human
was
around
he
lowered
himself
to
the
damp
ground
cradling
his
head
in
his
cupped
hands
looking
at
nothing
as
the
moon
rose
over
the
back
of
the
mountain
the
ring
he
wore
pressed
into
his
scalp
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
face
trying
to
see
the
ring
in
the
dim
light
abruptly
he
tugged
at
it
meaning
to
pull
it
off
fling
it
away
as
if
the
action
would
undo
that
morning
three
weeks
ago
when
they
d
put
it
on
his
finger
it
was
too
tight
he
would
wear
it
always
he
turned
his
face
to
the
d
felt
lightheaded
and
a
little
shaky
when
he
d
stood
up
in
the
early
light
three
weeks
ago
he
had
narrowed
his
eyes
against
the
rising
sun
that
reddened
the
sky
over
trey
mountain
the
small
wooden
buildings
of
renascence
lay
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
hills
he
was
hungry
he
had
nt
eaten
for
nearly
two
days
he
wiped
the
dew
from
his
panpipes
onto
the
rough
cloth
of
his
outer
shirt
and
hooked
the
little
instrument
to
his
belt
across
the
clearing
a
fawn
browsing
at
the
new
grass
on
the
forest
s
edge
froze
at
his
movement
he
froze
too
looking
at
it
thinking
it
s
all
right
all
right
pretty
thing
no
one
here
wants
to
hurt
you
they
stood
for
a
full
minute
looking
at
each
other
then
it
moved
and
gardener
said
at
last
this
was
little
more
than
a
whisper
but
the
mike
picked
it
up
and
transmitted
it
perfectly
the
boys
sighed
a
rustle
of
wind
through
autumn
leaves
heck
bast
was
looking
around
truculently
eyes
rolling
pimples
glowing
such
a
deep
red
that
he
looked
like
a
boy
in
the
grip
of
a
tropical
illness
show
me
an
enemy
heck
bast
s
face
said
yeah
you
go
on
show
me
an
enemy
and
just
see
what
happens
to
him
gardener
looked
up
now
his
mad
eyes
appeared
filled
with
tears
yes
we
have
enemies
he
repeated
twice
now
the
state
of
indiana
has
tried
to
shut
me
down
do
you
know
what
the
radical
humanists
can
barely
stand
to
think
of
me
down
here
at
the
sunlight
home
teaching
my
boys
to
love
jesus
and
their
country
it
makes
em
mad
and
you
want
to
know
a
deep
old
dark
secret
they
leaned
forward
eyes
on
sunlight
gardener
we
do
nt
just
make
em
mad
gardener
said
in
a
hoarse
conspirator
s
whisper
we
make
em
scaaaaaared
hallelujah
oh
yeah
amen
in
a
flash
sunlight
gardener
grabbed
the
mike
again
and
he
was
off
up
and
down
back
and
forth
sometimes
he
jigged
a
two
step
neat
aspa
minstrel
in
a
cakewalk
he
bopped
the
word
to
them
pumping
one
arm
first
at
the
boys
then
up
toward
heaven
where
god
had
presumably
dragged
up
his
armchair
to
listen
we
scare
em
oh
yeah
scare
em
so
bad
they
got
to
have
another
cocktail
or
another
joint
or
another
sniff
of
cocaine
we
scare
em
because
even
smart
old
god
denying
jesus
hating
radical
humanists
like
them
can
smell
righteousness
and
the
love
of
god
and
when
they
smell
that
they
can
smell
the
brimstone
coming
out
of
smell
oh
no
so
they
send
down
an
extra
inspector
or
two
to
plant
garbage
under
the
kitchen
counters
or
to
let
loose
some
cock
a
roaches
in
the
flour
they
start
a
lot
of
vile
rumors
about
how
my
boys
are
beaten
are
you
beaten
no
they
roared
indignantly
and
jack
was
dumbfounded
to
see
morton
roaring
the
negative
out
as
enthusiastically
as
all
the
rest
even
though
a
bruise
was
already
beginning
to
form
on
morton
s
cheek
why
they
sent
down
a
bunch
of
smart
news
reporters
from
some
smart
radical
humanist
news
show
sunlight
gardener
cried
in
a
kind
of
disgusted
wonder
they
came
down
here
and
they
said
okay
who
are
we
supposed
to
do
the
hatchet
job
on
we
ve
done
a
hundred
and
fifty
already
we
re
experts
at
smearing
the
righteous
do
nt
worry
about
us
just
give
us
a
few
joints
and
a
few
cocktails
and
point
us
in
the
right
direction
but
we
fooled
em
almost
vicious
assent
they
did
nt
find
no
one
chained
to
a
beam
in
the
barn
did
they
did
nt
find
no
boys
in
strait
jackets
like
they
heard
down
in
town
from
some
of
those
hellbound
school
board
jackals
did
they
did
nt
find
no
boys
getting
their
fingernails
pulled
or
all
their
hair
shaved
off
or
nothing
like
that
most
they
could
find
was
some
boys
who
said
they
got
spanked
and
they
did
get
spanked
oh
yeah
they
was
spanked
and
i
d
testify
on
that
matter
myself
before
the
throne
of
almighty
god
with
a
lie
detector
strapped
to
each
arm
because
the
book
says
if
you
spare
that
rod
you
gon
na
spoil
that
child
and
if
you
believe
that
boys
you
gim
me
hallelujah
hallelujah
even
the
indiana
board
of
education
much
as
they
d
like
to
get
rid
of
me
and
leave
a
clear
field
for
the
devil
even
they
had
to
admit
that
when
it
comes
to
spanking
runs
just
about
the
same
that
if
you
spare
that
rod
you
gon
na
spoil
that
child
they
found
happy
boys
they
found
healthy
boys
they
found
boys
who
were
willing
to
walk
the
lord
and
talk
the
lord
oh
can
you
say
hallelujah
they
could
can
you
say
oh
yeah
they
could
do
that
too
sunlight
gardener
came
back
to
the
podium
the
lord
protects
those
that
love
him
and
the
lord
is
not
gon
na
see
a
bunch
of
dope
smoking
communist
loving
radical
humanists
take
away
this
resting
place
for
tired
confused
boys
there
were
a
few
boys
who
told
tattletale
lies
to
those
so
called
news
people
gardener
said
i
heard
the
lies
repeated
on
that
tv
news
show
and
although
the
boys
slinging
that
mud
were
too
cowardly
to
show
their
own
faces
on
the
screen
i
knew
oh
yeah
i
knew
those
voices
when
you
ve
fed
a
boy
when
you
ve
held
his
head
tenderly
against
your
breast
why
i
guess
then
you
know
his
voice
those
boys
are
gone
now
god
may
forgive
them
i
hope
he
does
oh
yeah
but
sunlight
gardener
is
just
a
man
he
hung
his
head
to
show
what
a
shameful
admission
this
was
but
when
he
raised
it
again
his
eyes
were
still
hot
sparkling
with
fury
sunlight
gardener
can
not
forgive
them
so
sunlight
gardener
set
them
out
on
the
road
again
they
have
been
sent
out
into
the
territories
but
there
they
shall
not
be
fed
there
even
the
trees
may
eat
them
up
like
beasts
which
walk
in
the
night
terrified
silence
in
the
room
behind
the
glass
panel
even
casey
looked
pallid
and
strange
the
book
says
that
god
sent
cain
out
to
the
east
of
eden
into
the
land
of
nod
being
cast
out
onto
the
road
is
like
that
my
boys
you
have
a
safe
haven
here
he
surveyed
them
but
if
you
weaken
woe
unto
you
hell
awaits
the
backslider
just
as
it
awaits
the
boy
or
man
who
dives
into
it
on
purpose
remember
boys
remember
let
us
pray
pit
took
jack
less
than
a
week
to
decide
that
a
detour
into
the
territories
was
the
yes
he
d
admitted
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
she
was
comfort
able
how
many
times
did
you
look
in
on
her
once
she
was
asleep
she
was
fine
mrs
harnick
and
mrs
drury
both
thought
they
saw
you
but
mrs
drury
said
it
was
at
five
after
three
and
mrs
harnick
was
sure
it
was
later
mrs
harnick
is
wrong
i
only
stopped
in
once
they
had
to
believe
him
half
the
time
mrs
harnick
was
almost
senile
but
the
rest
of
the
time
she
was
very
sharp
he
suddenly
picked
up
the
newspaper
again
he
d
taken
the
metro
home
an
old
woman
carrying
a
shopping
bag
and
leaning
on
a
cane
had
been
on
the
platform
he
d
been
about
to
go
the
express
roared
into
the
station
the
crowd
had
surged
forward
and
a
young
fellow
his
arms
filled
with
schoolbooks
had
nearly
knocked
the
old
lady
over
as
he
rushed
to
get
a
seat
he
recalled
how
he
had
helped
her
into
the
train
just
before
the
doors
closed
are
you
all
right
he
had
asked
oh
yes
my
i
was
afraid
i
d
fall
young
people
are
so
careless
not
like
in
my
day
they
are
cruel
he
said
softly
the
young
man
got
off
at
dupont
circle
and
crossed
the
plat
form
he
had
followed
him
managed
to
get
next
to
him
as
he
stood
at
the
front
of
the
crowd
right
at
the
edge
of
the
platform
as
the
train
approached
he
had
stepped
behind
him
and
jostled
his
arm
so
that
one
of
the
books
began
to
slip
the
young
man
grabbed
for
it
off
balance
as
he
was
it
was
easy
to
push
him
forward
the
book
and
newspaper
yes
here
it
was
on
page
three
nineteen
year
old
student
killed
by
metro
the
account
called
the
death
an
accident
a
bystander
had
seen
a
book
slip
from
the
student
s
arm
he
had
bent
forward
to
retrieve
it
and
lost
his
balance
the
coffee
cup
in
arthur
s
hands
had
grown
cold
he
would
make
a
fresh
cup
then
get
to
work
there
were
so
many
helpless
old
people
in
the
nursing
home
waiting
for
his
attention
his
mind
had
been
on
patricia
traymore
that
was
why
he
had
nt
been
more
careful
about
mrs
gillespie
tomorrow
he
d
tell
glory
he
had
to
work
late
and
he
d
go
back
to
patricia
traymore
s
house
he
had
to
get
in
again
glory
wanted
her
doll
back
at
ten
o
clock
on
the
twenty
fourth
pat
set
off
for
richmond
the
sun
had
come
out
strong
and
golden
but
the
air
was
still
very
cold
it
would
be
a
frosty
christmas
after
leaving
the
highway
she
took
three
wrong
turns
and
became
thoroughly
it
was
a
street
of
comfortable
medium
sized
tudor
style
houses
number
was
larger
than
its
neighbors
and
had
a
carved
sign
antiques
on
the
lawn
catherine
grapey
was
waiting
in
the
doorway
she
was
about
fifty
with
a
square
face
deep
set
blue
eyes
and
a
sturdy
slim
body
her
graying
hair
was
straight
and
blunt
cut
she
shook
pat
s
hand
warmly
i
feel
as
though
i
know
you
i
go
on
buying
trips
to
new
england
fairly
often
and
whenever
i
got
the
chance
i
watched
your
program
the
downstairs
was
used
as
a
showroom
chairs
couches
vases
lamps
paintings
oriental
carpets
china
and
fine
glassware
were
all
marked
with
tags
a
queen
anne
breakfront
held
delicate
figurines
a
sleepy
irish
setter
his
dark
red
hair
generously
sprinkled
with
gray
was
asleep
in
front
of
it
i
live
upstairs
mrs
graney
explained
technically
the
shop
is
closed
but
someone
phoned
and
asked
if
she
could
stop
in
for
you
pat
took
off
her
coat
she
looked
around
studying
the
contents
of
the
room
you
have
beautiful
things
i
like
to
think
so
mrs
graney
looked
pleased
i
love
searching
out
antiques
and
restoring
them
my
workshop
is
in
the
garage
she
poured
coffee
from
a
sheffield
pot
and
handed
a
cup
to
pat
and
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
surrounded
by
beautiful
things
with
that
auburn
hair
and
gold
blouse
you
look
as
though
you
belong
on
that
chippendale
couch
thank
you
pat
realized
she
liked
this
outspoken
woman
there
was
something
direct
and
honest
about
her
it
made
it
possible
to
get
right
to
the
point
of
the
visit
mrs
graney
you
can
understand
that
your
letter
was
quite
startling
but
will
you
tell
me
why
you
did
nt
contact
the
network
directly
instead
of
writing
to
me
catherine
graney
took
a
sip
of
coffee
as
i
told
you
i
integrity
in
your
work
and
i
did
nt
think
you
would
willingly
help
to
perpetuate
a
lie
that
s
why
i
m
appealing
to
you
to
make
sure
that
george
graney
s
name
is
not
mentioned
on
the
jennings
program
and
that
abigail
jennings
does
not
refer
to
pilot
error
in
connection
with
willard
s
death
my
husband
could
fly
anything
that
had
wings
pat
thought
of
the
already
edited
segments
for
the
program
the
senator
had
denounced
the
pilot
but
had
she
actually
mentioned
his
name
pat
was
nt
sure
but
she
did
remember
some
of
the
details
of
the
accident
did
nt
the
investigation
findings
indicate
that
your
husband
was
flying
too
low
she
asked
the
plane
was
flying
too
low
and
went
into
the
mountain
when
abigail
jennings
started
using
that
crash
as
a
means
for
getting
her
name
in
the
paper
as
a
spokesperson
for
airline
safety
regulations
i
should
have
objected
immediately
pat
watched
as
the
irish
setter
seeming
to
sense
the
tension
in
his
mistress
the
room
and
settled
at
her
feet
catherine
leaned
over
and
patted
him
why
did
nt
you
speak
up
immediately
many
reasons
i
had
a
baby
a
few
weeks
after
the
accident
and
i
suppose
i
wanted
to
be
considerate
of
willard
s
mother
willard
s
mother
yes
you
and
then
quietly
they
stepped
inside
it
was
a
small
presbyterian
church
on
the
residential
a
sunday
school
that
was
well
filled
and
as
the
black
faces
began
to
file
in
every
man
and
woman
in
the
church
turned
around
there
was
a
look
of
complete
shock
on
everyone
the
organ
stopped
one
woman
fainted
another
began
to
scream
and
within
a
matter
of
moments
all
hell
broke
loose
the
minister
began
to
shout
someone
ran
to
call
the
police
and
only
dr
clarke
s
volunteers
remained
calm
standing
solidly
along
the
back
wall
causing
no
trouble
at
all
as
people
turned
and
jeered
hurled
insults
at
them
even
though
they
were
in
church
within
moments
the
town
s
tiny
squad
of
riot
police
had
arrived
they
had
been
recently
trained
for
the
sit
ins
that
had
begun
to
occur
and
were
mostly
composed
of
highway
patrolmen
but
they
began
to
push
and
shove
and
drag
the
uncooperating
black
bodies
out
as
they
made
themselves
limp
and
allowed
themselves
to
be
dragged
away
and
suddenly
tana
realized
what
was
happening
to
them
she
was
next
it
was
happening
to
us
and
to
her
and
suddenly
two
enormous
policemen
hovered
over
her
and
grabbed
her
roughly
by
both
arms
waving
their
sticks
in
her
face
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
white
trash
her
eyes
were
huge
as
they
dragged
her
off
and
with
every
ounce
of
her
being
she
wanted
to
hit
and
bite
and
kick
thinking
of
richard
blake
and
how
he
had
been
killed
but
she
did
nt
dare
they
threw
her
into
the
back
of
the
truck
with
much
of
dr
clarke
s
group
and
half
an
hour
later
she
was
being
fingerprinted
and
she
was
in
jail
she
sat
in
a
jail
cell
for
the
rest
of
the
day
with
fifteen
other
girls
all
of
them
black
and
she
could
see
sharon
across
the
way
they
had
each
been
allowed
one
phone
call
the
whites
at
least
the
blacks
were
still
being
processed
according
to
the
cops
and
sharon
shouted
to
her
tana
did
she
arrived
in
yolan
at
midnight
and
released
sharon
and
tana
simultaneously
congratulating
them
both
tana
could
see
that
she
looked
harder
and
more
drawn
than
she
had
six
months
before
but
she
seemed
pleased
with
what
the
girls
had
done
she
was
nt
even
upset
when
sharon
told
her
the
news
the
next
day
she
was
being
kicked
out
of
green
hill
effective
immediately
her
things
had
already
been
packed
by
the
housemother
of
jasmine
house
and
she
was
being
asked
to
leave
the
campus
before
noon
tana
was
in
shock
when
she
heard
and
she
knew
what
she
could
expect
for
herself
when
she
was
ushered
into
the
dean
s
office
it
was
just
as
she
had
thought
she
was
being
asked
to
leave
there
would
be
no
scholarship
the
following
year
in
fact
there
would
be
no
following
year
at
all
like
sharon
it
was
all
over
for
her
the
only
difference
was
that
if
she
was
willing
to
stay
on
in
a
probationary
state
she
which
would
at
least
mean
that
she
could
take
her
final
exams
and
apply
to
another
school
but
where
she
sat
in
her
room
in
shock
after
sharon
had
left
sharon
was
going
back
to
washington
with
her
mother
and
there
had
already
been
talk
of
her
spending
a
little
time
as
a
volunteer
for
dr
king
i
know
daddy
ll
be
mad
because
he
wants
me
to
go
to
school
but
you
know
truthfully
tan
i
ve
had
it
up
to
here
with
school
she
looked
sorrowfully
at
tana
then
but
what
about
you
she
was
devastated
about
the
price
of
the
sit
in
for
her
friend
she
had
never
gotten
arrested
before
although
they
had
been
warned
before
the
church
sit
in
that
it
was
a
real
possibility
yet
she
really
had
nt
expected
it
maybe
it
s
all
for
the
best
tana
tried
to
cheer
her
up
and
she
was
still
in
shock
when
sharon
left
and
she
sat
alone
in
her
room
until
dark
jasmine
house
keep
to
her
room
at
night
and
avoid
all
social
activities
including
the
freshman
prom
she
was
a
pariah
of
sorts
but
she
also
knew
that
school
would
be
over
in
three
weeks
the
worst
of
it
was
that
as
they
had
warned
tana
they
would
they
informed
jean
she
called
hysterical
that
night
sobbing
into
the
phone
why
did
nt
you
tell
me
that
little
bitch
was
black
what
difference
does
it
make
what
color
she
is
she
s
my
best
friend
but
tears
filled
tana
s
eyes
and
the
emotions
of
the
past
few
days
overwhelmed
her
suddenly
everyone
at
school
was
looking
at
her
as
though
she
had
killed
someone
and
sharon
was
gone
she
did
nt
know
where
she
would
go
to
school
next
year
and
her
mother
was
screaming
at
her
it
was
like
being
five
years
old
and
being
told
you
had
been
very
very
bad
but
not
being
sure
why
you
call
that
she
cost
you
your
scholarship
and
got
you
kicked
out
of

to
cry
again
you
re
giving
me
a
mammoth
pain
just
let
our
pesos
happily
i
got
in
the
front
seat
of
the
massive
old
buick
station
wagon
repainted
many
times
now
the
bright
red
of
the
flag
of
aztlan
in
fact
aztlan
s
red
flag
with
the
gold
radiant
sun
in
the
center
snapped
from
both
front
fenders
and
the
radio
antenna
jim
was
jammed
in
the
back
with
three
other
people
all
wearing
yellow
cards

i
said
my
spanish
is
less
than
minimal
as
these
impressions
of
el
paso
the
cemetery
beneath
the
complex
tangle
of
the
spaghetti
bowl
where
i
intersects
the
expressway
is
in
prewar
condition
unlike
the
situation
common
in
dallas
new
graves
have
not
been
dug
in
among
the
old
but
there
are
many
empty
buildings
empty
houses
and
abandoned
cars
just
before
we
turned
onto
piedras
we
saw
along
the
side
of
i
the
glittering
aluminum
ruins
of
a
jet
cracked
plastic
windows
in
the
few
bits
of
intact
fuselage
the
plane
s
markings
no
longer
readable
japanese
soldiers
passed
us
in
squat
toyota
military
vehicles
their
light
khaki
uniforms
were
spotless
the
rising
sun
on
their
shoulders
as
they
rode
along
they
shot
pictures
of
the
distant
franklin
mountains
with
minoltas
as
small
and
thin
as
credit
cards
earlier
we
had
noticed
a
restaurant
with
the
odd
name
gunther
s
lotus
blossom
a
closer
look
revealed
that
the
sign
had
once
read
gunther
s
edelweiss
before
warday
the
u
s
army
used
to
train
soldiers
of
the
german
federal
road
from
here
we
wondered
if
gunther
was
still
around
or
if
he
had
left
only
his
name
behind
japanese
military
planes
flew
low
overhead
they
were
odd
looking
things
with
their
wings
canted
forward
instead
of
swept
back
so
that
they
appeared
to
be
flying
backwards
instead
of
a
jet
s
familiar
scream
they
made
a
low
drumming
noise
that
seemed
almost
to
thump
your
chest
i
recall
the
strange
cant
of
the
wings
from
nasa
designs
for
future
hypersonic
aircraft
we
had
ridden
in
silence
for
some
time
when
the
driver
decided
to
try
striking
up
a
conversation
hey
gringo
he
said
with
a
big
smile
let
s
talk
norteamericano
see
if
i
can
still
do
it
his
name
was
carlos
leon
and
he
was
from
san
antonio
i
m
from
there
too
i
said
so
is
he
i
nodded
toward
jim
hey
compadres
i
grew
up
there
left
in
to
get
a
job
out
there
were
lots
of
jobs
here
again
i
was
managing
a
mcdonald
s
kept
at
it
too
until
the
meat
stopped
getting
delivered
then
i
said
the
hell
with
the
franchise
sold
the
equipment
and
signed
up
as
a
cooperator
they
assigned
me
to
pesetas
and
gave
me
a
permit
to
buy
a
station
wagon
our
co
op
consists
of
me
my
wife
the
bookkeeper
and
my
cousin
the
mechanic
where
did
you
live
in
san
antonio
west
side
i
lived
on
south
zarzamora
my
dad
was
a
garbage
man
but
not
in
his
own
neighborhood
we
had
to
take
our
garbage
to
the
dump
ourselves
until
the
fifties
my
mom
and
dad
died
in
san
antonio
i
lived
in
terrell
hills
i
said
rich
eh
my
dad
was
an
oilman
oh
boy
you
re
poor
now
eh
i
see
you
work
with
your
hands
i
m
poor
now
for
you
join
the
rest
of
the
world
i
laugh
no
more
oilmen
hey
that
s
good
no
more
oilmen
just
british
and
israeli
oil
import
agents
right
i
did
not
mention
that
texas
oil
was
flowing
again
and
that
refineries
were
opening
up
all
over
the
united
states
there
was
a
razor
edge
of
anger
among
these
people
this
was
their
place
their
time
at
last
and
these
their
days
of
sunshine
walls
pockmarked
with
bullet
holes
were
a
common
sight
as
we
neared
the
center
of
town
jim
and
i
went
to
central
i
said
hoping
carlos
might
also
be
an
alumnus
this
is
not
as
unlikely
as
it
sounds
central
catholic
had
a
substantial
hispanic
population
when
we
attended
the
sudden
silence
tells
me
that
my
suspicion
is
correct
carlos
stops
the
car
well
goddamn
brother
halaby
shit
yeah
brother
arafia
the
spider
the
spider
taught
world
history
and
his
real
name
was
brother
gordon
but
his
thin
six
foot
four
frame
gained
him
the
nickname
brother
arafla
so
total
was
his
identification
with
us
that
he
was
known
to
get
mean
when
freshmen
called
him
brother
gordon
i
m
brother
arafia
he
would
snarl
and
do
nt
you
forget
it
carlos
had
been
five
years
ahead
of
us
at
central
you
remember
brother
deloach
he
asked
he
was
principal
our
freshman
year
he
retired
he
taught
me
a
hell
of
a
lot
i
was
a
real
bad
kid
when
i
went
there
angry
you
know
and
so
damn
stupid
i
d
been
a
year
at
southton
already
they
hit
me
with
a
razor
strap
there
i
was
down
for
selling
grass
shining
shoes
and
dealing
grass
to
the
soldiers
on
alamo
plaza
then
going
to
the
alameda
to
see
cantinflas
movies
you
know
what
we
got
for
a
joint
we
called
them
mary
janes
but
they
cost
us
eighty
five
cents
apiece
so
we
were
risking
years
of
freedom
for
fifteen
cents
sure
enough
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
down
for
a
year
and
my
mom
and
dad
were
thinking
they
had
raised
a
rotten
kid
when
i
got
out
i
applied
to
central
no
way
i
m
gon
na
get
in
my
parents
figure
i
m
fourteen
and
already
a
jailbird
but
deloach
he
lets
me
in
you
stay
away
from
the
mary
janes
or
i
ll
paddle
your
behind
he
says
you
re
a
smart
kid
that
s
your
problem
we
ll
give
you
a
little
something
to
do
with
your
mind
you
ll
stay
out
of
trouble
did
it
work
i
loved
that
school
one
of
these
days
i
m
gon
na
inflating
blobbily
behind
me
just
how
far
away
are
you
it
firmed
beneath
me
more
than
nine
thousand
light
years
she
toyed
with
something
that
was
gold
and
thin
black
nobs
on
both
ends
pencil
microphone
letter
opener
that
s
a
rather
costly
hyperwave
projection
just
to
say
hello
we
have
forty
minutes
conference
time
marq
a
few
seconds
out
for
nostalgia
wo
nt
hurt
we
ll
let
it
go
at
that
i
had
some
good
memories
of
japril
her
insight
her
ambition
i
also
had
reason
to
wonder
if
some
of
her
memories
of
me
were
not
so
pleasant
i
d
thought
you
d
be
somebody
calling
to
chide
me
about
my
current
cargo
but
this
has
got
to
be
about
some
past
crime
of
mine
if
not
some
crime
to
come
spiders
all
think
industrial
diplomacy
is
a
crime
they
may
be
right
japril
went
from
smile
to
grin
with
those
big
teeth
of
hers
actually
it
s
neither
her
fingers
came
together
on
the
golden
bar
calculator
energy
knife
water
purifier
relax
what
do
you
know
of
rhyonon
a
memory
of
clym
and
a
chill
only
that
no
one
is
supposed
to
know
that
much
about
it
funny
thing
about
that
chill
it
did
nt
subside
there
s
something
permanently
scary
about
an
entire
world
s
death
the
rescue
operations
the
few
thoundsand
we
got
out
say
or
the
few
colony
ships
the
web
managed
to
load
up
in
hours
and
evacuate
during
the
course
of
the
disaster
the
survivors
we
managed
to
pry
out
of
the
peripheral
ruins
and
smoking
wreckage
once
the
major
conflagration
was
over
the
web
is
information
it
s
silly
to
lie
to
a
spider
especially
one
with
that
many
rays
rainbowing
her
sunburst
nothing
i
know
she
said
there
were
nt
any
at
least
of
those
see
what
i
mean
you
want
to
know
where
i
am
japril
s
fingers
moved
absently
on
the
stick
sound
recorder
cosmetics
case
musical
instrument
possibly
having
something
to
do
with
it
possibly
not
minors
blanked
out
among
us
reflections
vanished
behind
japril
a
wide
indistinct
window
looked
out
on
a
brown
landscape
boxed
and
blotted
with
architectural
oddities
some
angular
some
freeform
many
connected
by
arching
i
m
at
a
rescue
station
on
the
sixth
moon
of
chyvon
in
the
tyon
omega
system
chyvon
s
a
gas
giant
one
out
from
rhyonon
within
an
hour
of
the
catastrophe
a
rescue
station
was
set
up
on
rhyonon
s
nearest
moon
and
an
overflow
station
here
then
some
did
get
out
hearing
as
i
said
it
how
ridiculous
it
sounded
with
two
years
planning
you
can
lift
a
few
thousand
women
from
one
world
and
relocate
them
on
another
how
many
can
you
evacuate
within
minutes
the
station
on
rhyonon
s
moon
was
closed
down
to
a
skeleton
staff
within
a
hundred
hours
after
the
catastrophe
i
would
have
thought
that
the
majority
of
the
refugees
i
felt
strange
calling
the
survivors
of
an
entire
world
refugees
would
have
been
brought
to
the
nearer
station
the
reason
we
maintain
the
skeleton
staff
on
rhyonon
s
moon
is
at
least
to
suggest
to
those
who
re
suggestible
the
possibility
of
is
nt
one
as
far
as
illusions
go
it
s
pretty
paltry
believe
me
i
was
nt
in
favor
of
it
when
it
was
decided
on
japril
i
said
are
there
any
survivors
at
all
she
took
a
long
time
to
say
yes
and
they
re
not
on
rhyonon
s
moon
but
rather
on
that
moon
of
chyvon
with
you
she
took
an
even
longer
time
to
nod
throwing
me
to
all
those
far
flung
cultures
where
a
nod
does
not
necessarily
signal
affirmation
but
they
were
not
japril
s
nonchalantly
as
i
could
manage
i
asked
how
many
one
reason
japril
became
friends
with
me
in
the
first
place
is
because
of
her
uncanny
ability
to
see
through
my
diplomatic
masks
why
do
nt
i
tell
you
instead
your
relation
to
this
survivor
marq
you
mean
this
woman
is
a
factor
in
my
life
of
a
notable
relation
and
do
nt
discount
rumor
it
s
the
real
order
of
business
this
evening
where
i
was
i
was
thinking
of
it
this
afternoon
but
no
matter
i
ve
noted
that
relation
and
the
web
wants
to
exploit
it
which
is
why
you
ve
called
on
me
to
talk
about
it
across
nine
thousand
light
years
one
reason
i
became
friends
with
japril
is
because
of
how
quickly
her
ambitious
and
devious
plans
open
all
their
exfoliations
to
my
view
there
is
a
survivor
is
nt
there
at
least
one
really
i
was
thinking
of
clym
far
more
than
the
various
suggestions
japril
had
all
but
thrown
in
front
of
me
we
ve
had
rat
korga
here
at
the
station
for
there
was
relief
in
her
voice
as
she
said
the
name
to
me
for
the
first
time
and
i
got
a
sense
that
this
was
something
she
had
not
talked
about
with
many
people
and
that
circle
was
something
she
had
wanted
to
do
for
well
for
a
while
now
let
me
tell
you
about
rhyonon
marq
sit
back
and
i
ll
catalogue
the
horrors
i
ve
done
it
in
enough
reports
that
i
can
recite
it
in
my
sleep
the
flame
shell
japril
said
where
it
roared
across
rhyonon
s
surface
was
over
fifty
thousand
feet
high
which
effectively
did
in
any
passing
air
travel
most
of
the
actual
holocaust
was
confined
to
the
equatorial
areas
so
was
ninety
percent
of
rhyonon
s
population
the
resultant
gaseous
toxins
alone
not
to
mention
the
incredible
heatstorms
that
went
raging
out
north
and
south
pretty
wets
mu
in
use
parts
of
the
world
that
were
not
directly
burned
winds
over
the
whole
planet
rose
to
nearly
six
hundred
kilometers
an
hour
in
ten
hours
the
major
flaming
areas
had
more
or
less
burned
themselves
out
with
twelve
percent
of
the
planetary
surface
fused
and
the
atmosphere
radically
deoxygenated
back
into
the
woods
babe
broke
into
a
trot
at
the
sound
of
the
shots
it
was
important
to
warn
uncle
alton
about
what
her
father
had
said
but
it
was
more
interesting
to
find
out
what
he
had
bagged
oh
he
d
bagged
it
all
right
uncle
alton
never
fired
without
killing
this
was
about
the
first
time
she
had
ever
heard
him
blast
away
like
that
must
be
a
bear
she
thought
excitedly
tripping
over
a
root
sprawling
rolling
to
her
feet
again
without
noticing
the
tumble
she
d
love
to
have
another
bearskin
in
her
room
where
would
she
put
it
maybe
they
could
line
it
and
she
could
have
it
for
a
blanket
uncle
alton
evening
oh
no
no
not
with
this
trouble
between
him
and
dad
oh
if
she
could
only
do
something
she
tried
to
run
faster
worried
and
anticipating
but
she
was
out
of
breath
and
went
more
slowly
instead
at
the
top
of
the
rise
by
the
edge
of
the
woods
she
stopped
and
looked
back
far
down
in
the
valley
lay
the
south
thirty
she
scanned
it
carefully
looking
for
her
father
the
new
furrows
and
the
old
were
sharply
defined
and
her
keen
eyes
saw
immediately
that
cory
had
left
the
line
with
the
cultivator
and
had
angled
the
team
over
to
the
shade
trees
without
finishing
his
row
that
was
nt
like
him
she
could
see
the
team
now
and
cory
s
pale
blue
denim
was
nowhere
in
sight
she
giggled
lightly
to
herself
as
she
thought
of
the
way
she
would
fool
her
father
and
the
little
sound
of
laughter
drowned
out
for
her
the
sound
of
alton
s
hoarse
dying
scream
she
reached
and
the
shots
came
from
up
around
here
somewhere
she
stopped
and
listened
several
times
and
then
suddenly
heard
something
coming
toward
her
fast
she
ducked
under
cover
terrified
and
a
little
baby
faced
man
in
black
his
blue
eyes
wide
with
horror
crashed
blindly
past
her
the
leather
case
he
carried
catching
on
the
branches
it
spun
a
moment
and
then
fell
right
in
front
of
her
the
man
never
missed
it
babe
lay
there
for
a
long
moment
and
then
picked
up
the
case
and
faded
into
the
woods
things
were
happening
too
fast
for
her
she
wanted
uncle
alton
but
she
dared
not
call
she
stopped
again
and
strained
her
ears
back
toward
the
edge
of
the
wood
she
heard
her
father
s
voice
and
another
s
probably
the
man
who
had
dropped
the
brief
case
she
dared
not
go
over
there
filled
with
enjoyable
terror
she
thought
hard
then
snapped
her
fingers
in
triumph
she
and
alton
had
played
injun
many
times
up
here
they
practiced
birdcalls
until
she
knew
them
better
than
the
birds
themselves
what
would
it
be
ah
blue
jay
she
threw
back
her
head
and
by
some
youthful
alchemy
produced
a
nerve
shattering
screech
that
would
have
done
justice
to
any
jay
that
ever
flew
she
repeated
it
and
then
twice
more
the
response
was
immediate
the
call
of
a
blue
jay
four
times
spaced
two
and
two
babe
nodded
to
herself
happily
that
was
the
signal
that
they
were
to
meet
immediately
at
the
place
the
place
was
a
hide
out
that
he
had
discovered
and
shared
with
her
and
not
another
soul
knew
of
it
an
angle
of
rock
beside
a
stream
not
far
away
it
was
nt
exactly
a
cave
but
almost
enough
so
to
he
entrancing
babe
trotted
happily
away
toward
the
brook
she
had
just
known
that
uncle
alton
would
remember
the
call
of
the
blue
jay
and
what
it
meant
in
the
tree
that
arched
over
alton
s
scattered
body
perched
a
large
jay
bird
of
the
presence
of
death
hardly
noticing
babe
s
realistic
cry
it
screamed
again
four
times
two
and
two
it
took
cory
more
than
a
moment
to
recover
himself
from
what
he
had
seen
i
le
turned
away
from
it
and
leaned
weakly
against
a
pine
panting
alton
that
w
as
alton
lying
there
in
parts
god
god
god
god
gradually
his
strength
returned
and
he
forced
himself
to
turn
again
stepping
carefully
he
bent
and
picked
up
the
its
barrel
was
bright
and
lean
but
the
butt
and
stock
were
smeared
with
some
kind
of
stinking
rottenness
where
had
he
seen
the
stuff
before
somewhere
no
matter
he
cleaned
it
off
absently
throwing
the
beliruled
bandanna
away
afterward
through
his
mind
tan
alton
s
words
was
that
only
last
night
i
m
goin
to
start
trackin
an
i
m
inn
to
keep
trackin
till
i
find
the
one
done
this
job
he
found
alton
s
box
of
shells
the
box
was
wet
and
sticky
that
made
it
better
somehow
a
bullet
wet
with
alton
s
blood
was
the
right
thing
to
use
he
went
away
a
short
distance
circled
around
till
he
found
heavy
footprints
then
came
back
i
m
a
trackin
for
you
bud
he
whispered
thickly
and
began
through
the
brush
he
followed
its
wavering
spoor
amazed
at
the
amount
of
filthy
mold
about
gradually
associating
it
with
the
thing
that
had
killed
his
brother
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
for
him
anymore
but
hate
and
doggedness
cursing
himself
for
not
getting
alton
home
last
night
he
followed
the
tracks
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
they
led
him
to
a
big
tree
there
and
there
he
saw
something
else
the
footprints
of
the
little
city
man
nearby
lay
some
tattered
scraps
of
linen
and
what
was
that
another
set
of
prints
small
ones
small
stub
toed
ones
somewhere
a
blue
jay
called
babe
stopped
and
turned
when
she
heard
her
father
s
voice
faint
with
distance
piercing
listen
at
him
holler
she
crooned
delightedly
gee
he
sounds
mad
she
sent
a
jay
bird
s
call
disrespectfully
back
to
him
and
hurried
to
the
place
it
consisted
of
a
mammoth
boulder
beside
the
brook
some
upheaval
in
the
glacial
age
had
some
thunderstorm
had
blown
through
the
pride
s
corridor
and
the
sun
had
come
out
again
but
then
haral
pyanfar
turned
abruptly
hilfy
stood
there
with
a
pistol
in
hand
what
do

the

particular
idid
nt
have
to

she
s
all
right
haral
said
sure
but
she
did
not
get
the
cold
of
it
out
of
her
gut
until
she
had
gotten
back
to
the
bridge
and
into
the
galley
what
he
want
tully
asked
worried
looking
half
rising
from
the
table
but
pyanfar
pushed
him
down
again
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
nothing
but
nuisance
he
give
money

me
he
down
onto
the
bench
and
reached
for
her
abandoned
cup
so
what
did
he
want
khym
took
the
cup
before
her
hand
got
there
and
slid
a
hot
one
into
her
hand
good
khym
said
she
looked
up
at
her
husband
puzzled
good
khym
said
again
meaning
just
she
thought
good
job
she
doubted
it
but
she
sipped
the
gfi
and
looked
up
at
him
she
saw
patience
in
his
amber
eyes
patience
he
had
won
the
hard
way
your
cabin
s
taken
she
said
pointedly
huh
he
looked
embarrassed
at
the
invitation
when
he
had
realized
it
geran
was
there
another
male
was
then
he
looked
pleased
in
spite
of
himself
his
ears
flicked
gods
tc
a
methane
breathers
she
remembered
the
knnn
that
had
paced
them
out
of
meetpoint
and
the
hair
wanted
to
stand
up
on
her
back
again
something
he
said
was
important
something
was
worth
the
trip
here
him
would
be
lord
assume
we
are
allies
remember
this
at
kefk
something
wrong
he
asked
revenge
on
all
our
enemies
hani
there
will
be
a
day
you
want
it
not
yet
she
said
she
caught
the
plastic
wrapped
confection
geran
spun
her
way
on
the
tabletop
haral
and
tirun
blundered
back
in
hunting
gfi
and
food
she
tore
the
plastic
and
swallowed
the
mince
in
hunks
guaranteed
to
make
for
hiccups
she
chased
it
with
gfi
gods
tofi
the
spice
made
her
sneeze
slow
down
for
the
gods
sake
what
slow
down
we
ve
got
eight
and
a
half
hours
to
sleep
she
stood
up
and
grabbed
khym
s
arm
come
on

suddenly
i
m
in
the
mood
gods
py
who
notices
finish
the
gfi
come
on
eight
and
a
half
hours
was
not
enough
the
alarm
went
off
like
attack
and
mayhem
and
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
remember
where
she
was
and
what
there
was
waiting
and
to
pull
herself
and
her
half
conscious
husband
out
of
bed
and
face
it
she
faced
it
in
a
plain
twill
pair
of
blue
trousers
common
spacer
like
because
they
were
headed
out
and
other
side
of
that
jump
was
likely
no
time
for
washup
or
amenities
she
saved
her
brightest
silk
pair
for
after
cleanup
on
the
docks
at
kefk
healthiest
to
think
in
those
terms
that
there
would
be
the
need
of
red
silk
trousers
and
all
the
finery
but
she
did
put
on
the
ruby
pendant
earring
among
the
others
that
winked
and
shone
ferociously
in
the
red
gold
sweep
of
her
tufted
manyringedear
it
advised
all
who
wanted
to
argue
with
a
rather
plainly
dressed
hani
that
she
held
a
captaincy
on
such
a
day
she
needed
all
the
convincing
it
could
lend

tirun
said
and
swallowed
all
further
argument
they
were
all
up

functioning
chur
came
out
from
khym

former
cabin
to
sit

up

pottering
about
the

with

and
hilfy
getting

on

the

leaned
over

and
took
a
look
at

it
was

again
mkks
began
to
have
the

in
its
operations
any

on
mkks
who
valued
his

she
reckoned

headed
for

she
thought
of
others
of
the
noninvolved
non
kif
wishing
they
could
have
evacuated
the
entire
station
but
that
was
impossible
mahendo
sat
and
stsho
had
to
stay
and
trust
the
few
conventions
of
non

and
neutrality
even

she
thought
put
in
a
call
to
jik
want
to
see
him
now
it
s
important
there
were
few
inmates
in
the
prison
who
could
have
gotten
away
with
it
but
big
bertha
was
one
of
them
the
prison
authorities
were
well
aware
of
her
power
they
had
seen
her
start
riots
and
they
had
seen
her
stop
them
no
prison
in
the
world
could
be
run
without
the
cooperation
of
the
inmate
leaders
and
big
bertha
was
a
leader
she
had
been
seated
in
the
warden
s
outer
office
for
almost
an
hour
her
huge
a
disgusting
looking
creature
the
warden
s
secretary
thought
she
gives
me
the
creeps
how
much
longer
big
bertha
demanded
it
should
nt
be
too
much
longer
he
has
a
group
of
people
in
with
him
the
warden
s
very
busy
this
morning
big
bertha
said
he
s
gon
na
be
busier
she
looked
at
her
watch
twelve
forty
five
plenty
of
time
it
was
a
perfect
day
cloudless
and
warm
and
the
singing
breeze
carried
a
tantalizing
mixture
of
scents
across
the
green
farmland
tracy
had
spread
out
a
tablecloth
on
a
grassy
area
near
the
lake
and
amy
was
happily
munching
on
an
egg
salad
sandwich
tracy
glanced
at
her
watch
it
was
already
she
could
not
believe
it
the
morning
had
dragged
and
the
afternoon
was
winging
by
she
had
to
think
of
something
quickly
or
time
was
going
to
steal
away
her
last
chance
at
freedom
one
ten
in
the
warden
s
reception
office
warden
brannigan
s
secretary
i
m
sorry
the

impossible
for

big
bertha
pushed
herself
to
her
feet
he
s
got
to
see
me
it
s
we
ll
fit
you
in
tomorrow
big
bertha
started
to
say
tomorrow
will
be
too
late
but
she
stopped
herself
in
time
no
one
but
the
warden
himself
must
know
what
she
was
doing
snitches
suffered
fatal
accidents
but
she
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
there
was
no
way
she
was
going
to
let
tracy
whitney
get
away
from
her
she
walked
into
the
prison
library
and
sat
down
at
one
of
the
long
tables
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
she
scribbled
a
note
and
when
the
matron
walked
over
to
an
aisle
to
help
an
initiate
big
bertha
dropped
the
note
on
her
desk
and
left
when
the
matron
returned
she
found
the
note
and
opened
it
she
read
it
twice
you
no
signature
a
hoax
the
matron
had
no
way
of
knowing
she
picked
up
the
telephone
get
me
the
superintendent
of
guards
one
fifteen
you

amy
said
you

some
of
my
sandwich
no
leave
me
alone
she
had
not
meant
to
speak
so
harshly
amy
stopped
eating

tracy
please

i

much
i

her
soft

filled
with

m
not
angry
she
was
in
hell
i
m
not
hungry
if
you
re
not
let
s
play
ball
tracy
and
amy
pulled
her
rubber
ball
out
of
her
pocket
one
sixteen
she
should
have
been
on
her
way
it
would
take
her
at
least
fifteen
minutes
to
get
to
the
utility
room
she
could
just
make
it
if
she
hurried
but
she
and
in
the
far
distance
she
saw
a
group
of
trusties
picking
crops
instantly
tracy
knew
what
she
was
going
to
do
do
nt
you
want
to
play
ball
tracy
tracy
rose
to
her
feet
yes
let
s
play
a
new
game
let

see
who
can
throw
the
ball
the
farthest
i
ll
throw
the
ball
and
then
it
will
be
your
turn
tracy
picked
up
the
hard
rubber
ball
and
threw
it
as
far
as
she
could
in
the
direction
of
the
workers
oh
that
s
good
amy
said
admiringly
that
s
real
far
i
ll
go
get
the
ball
tracy
said
you
wait
here
and
she
was
running
running
for
her
life
her
feet
flying
across
the
fields
it
was
if
she
was
late
they
would
wait
for
her
or
would
they
she
ran
faster
behind
her
she
heard
amy
calling
but
she
paid
no
attention
now
tracy
yelled
at
them
and
they
stopped
she
was
breathless
when
she
reached
them
anythin
wrong
one
of
them
asked
no
n
nothing
she
was
panting
fighting
for
breath
the
little
girl
back
there
one
of
you
look
after
her
i
have
something
important
i
have
to
do
i
she
heard
her
name
called
from
a
distance
and
turned
amy
was
standing
on
top
of
the
concrete
wall
surrounding
the
lake
she
waved
look
at
me
tracy
no
et
down
tracy
screamed
and
as
tracy
watched
in
horror
amy
lost
her
balance
and
plunged
into
the
lake
oh
dear
god
the
blood
drained
from
tracy
s
face
she
had
a
choice
to
make
but
there
was
no
choice
i
ca
nt
help
her
not
now
someone
will
save
her
i
have
to
save
myself
i
ve
got
to
get
out
of
this
tracy
turned
and
began
running
as
fast
as
she
had
ever
run
in
her
life
the
others
were
calling
after
her
but
she
did
not
hear
them
she
flew
through
the
air
unaware
that
her
shoes
had
fallen
off
not
caring
that
the
sharp
ground
was
cutting
into
her
feet
her
heart
was
pounding
and
her
lungs
were
bursting
and
she
pushed
herself
to
run
faster
faster
she
reached
the
wall
around
the
lake
and
vaulted
on
top
of
it
far
below
she
could
see
amy
in
the
deep
terrifying
water
struggling
to
stay
afloat
without
a
second
s
hesitation
tracy
jumped
in
after
her
and
as
she
hit
the
water
tracy
thought
oh
my
god
i
ca
nt
swim
new
orleans
friday
august
a
m
lester
torrance
a
teller
at
the
first
merchants
bank
orleans
prided
himself
on
two
things
his
sexual
prow
the
ladies
and
his
ability
to
misrule
nonetheless
babcock
paid
them
more
than
their
due
he
made
a
very
low
bow
to
the
tiers
and
another
to
those
standing
and
then
said
they
should
all
presently
witness
a
spectacle
of
ursine
puissance
not
to
be
matched
at
the
bear
gardens
of
southwark
or
by
other
famous
bears
of
the
town
he
then
proceeded
to
name
this
boast
provoked
many
a
cynical
guffaw
and
denial
from
the
impatient
crowd
meanwhile
the
dogs
who
had
been
confined
in
a
small
enclosure
in
front
of
joan
began
to
bark
and
whine
so
that
babcock
s
final
remarks
before
disappearing
into
samson
s
tent
were
completely
lost
on
the
crowd
these
same
dogs
had
been
raised
to
such
a
pitch
of
excitement
by
the
humannoise
and
the
smell
of
the
bear
that
they
now
were
practically
beyond
the
control
of
their
keepers
they
began
to
fight
with
each
other
and
their
keepers
were
at
great
trouble
to
separate
the
most
belligerent
of
them
at
last
one
of
the
animals
a
particularly
scrappy
little
spaniel
was
so
quite
unfit
to
fight
the
bear
and
had
to
be
removed
meanwhile
joan
only
vaguely
aware
of
these
happenings
and
caring
less
continued
to
search
for
her
husband
in
the
crowd
her
searching
was
by
eye
alone
for
she
was
unable
to
move
from
where
she
stood
it
was
not
therefore
that
she
could
have
done
anything
had
she
seen
him
but
just
seeing
him
and
seeing
him
whole
would
have
been
sufficient
at
this
moment
for
she
had
a
terrible
fear
that
somehow
he
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
multitude
and
she
should
have
to
go
back
to
chelmsford
alone
with
not
even
his
dead
body
for
company
the
quarreling
dogs
had
caused
a
delay
in
the
proceedings
but
their
owners
had
now
regained
control
and
still
the
bear
did
not
appear
the
crowd
began
to
boo
and
hiss
and
presently
francis
crisp
came
out
of
the
tent
and
made
motions
for
them
to
be
quieter
his
efforts
were
futile
the
uproar
increased
crisp
went
back
inside
the
tent
a
moment
later
of
which
was
samson
who
was
wagging
his
shaggy
head
and
thrusting
his
nose
forward
in
the
air
to
sniff
out
the
scent
of
the
dogs
at
the
appearance
of
samson
the
crowd
s
boos
turned
into
cheers
crisp
chained
the
bear
to
the
tethering
stake
and
as
if
on
cue
samson
rose
to
his
hind
legs
and
stood
manlike
pawing
the
air
as
though
saluting
the
assembly
like
an
old
roman
gladiator
about
to
give
mortal
battle
it
s
no
wonder
he
could
kill
a
man
someone
said
near
to
joan
by
which
she
understood
the
word
had
spread
about
the
dead
man
joan
felt
yet
another
chill
of
apprehension
she
futilely
stared
about
her
in
a
renewed
effort
to
find
matthew
a
short
thickset
man
in
a
loose
fitting
shirt
led
his
dogs
forward
and
unleashed
them
one
by
one
so
that
each
animal
sprang
forward
into
a
position
just
beyond
the
extent
of
the
bear
s
swing
the
crowd
roared
samson
glared
at
the
dogs
with
his
small
eyes
and
then
took
a
mighty
swing
on
the
side
of
its
head
and
sending
it
flying
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
paling
while
the
dog
lay
stunned
by
the
blow
his
confederates
now
joined
the
attack
and
in
the
fray
that
followed
joan
could
not
hear
the
sound
of
dog
or
bear
for
the
boisterous
enthusiasm
of
the
crowd
for
this
bloody
spectacle
samson
was
now
on
his
hind
feet
pawing
the
air
threateningly
bellowing
and
flailing
at
the
attacking
dogs
one
spaniel
more
courageous
than
the
rest
attacked
the
bear
directly
and
for
a
moment
hung
upon
his
chest
his
teeth
fastened
into
the
thick
fur
until
samson
caught
the
creature
in
a
hug
that
crushed
the
dog
s
spine
then
let
him
drop
at
his
feet
in
the
meantime
the
other
dogs
were
circling
snarling
and
lunging
alert
for
any
part
of
the
bear
s
anatomy
that
they
might
attack
with
impunity
their
fangs
were
bare
and
dripping
with
saliva
their
eyes
intense
the
bear
swung
round
and
round
letting
fly
with
his
arms
again
with
a
threatening
suddenness
samson
caught
one
dog
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
sent
him
sprawling
into
the
dust
his
head
a
bloody
pulp
the
bear
shredded
the
fur
from
another
s
back
and
broke
the
forelegs
of
a
third
before
the
remaining
attackers
recognizing
the
superiority
of
bear
to
dog
despite
their
numbers
began
to
lose
enthusiasm
for
the
fight
scampering
over
the
bodies
of
their
fallen
kennel
mates
they
went
whimpering
back
to
their
crestfallen
master
who
gave
the
bloodied
survivors
a
few
good
kicks
for
their
pains
the
conclusion
of
the
fight
brought
frenzied
applause
from
all
sides
as
onlookers
scrambled
to
collect
their
winnings
which
evidently
were
based
on
both
the
winner
of
the
combat
bear
or
dog
and
on
the
extent
of
the
destruction
three
dogs
fallen
out
of
the
brace
of
half
dozen
who
had
commenced
the
attack
but
joan
thought
the
whole
spectacle
the
most
disgusting
she
had
ever
witnessed
the
fight
confirmed
what
she
had
long
believed
that
here
was
the
most
abominable
of
sports
for
as
she
was
for
matthew
s
safety
and
disgusted
at
the
spectacle
before
her
she
was
now
forced
to
stand
as
witness
to
this
carnage
while
god
only
knew
what
mortal
mischief
her
husband
might
be
subject
to
assuming
as
she
did
that
he
was
somewhere
within
the
confines
of
the
bear
garden
while
bear
and
hound
tore
at
each
other
with
tooth
and
nail
to
the
delight
of
the
multitude
joan
could
think
only
of
the
deadly
blade
so
vividly
described
in
esmera
s
vision
a
vision
enacted
for
her
again
every
time
one
of
the
drunken
louts
she
was
wedged
between
jabbed
an
elbow
in
her
ribs
or
shoved
her
from
behind
in
the
general
excitement
it
was
with
great
relief
ways
can
be
amicable
but
amicable
or
not
it
is
occurring
if
rapture
had
been
dependent
she
was
so
no
more
mym
was
so
angry
at
this
betrayal
that
he
could
not
even
speak
in
singsong
well
farewell
she
said
and
turned
and
walked
away
now
mym
saw
thanatos
in
the
adjacent
chamber
ready
to
convey
rapture
back
to
the
realm
of
the
mortals
she
had
come
only
to
inform
mym
of
her
decision
mym
tasted
blood
in
his
mouth
in
his
rage
he
had
bitten
his
tongue
now
that
blood
was
triggering
a
rage
of
a
different
nature
he
would
deal
with
this
john
of
hers
he
grasped
the
red
sword
and
willed
himself
to
the
mortal
realm
he
knew
where
rapture
worked
and
where
she
lived
from
there
he
should
be
able
to
trace
this
mortal
man
john
but
then
he
paused
was
he
the
incarnation
of
war
to
to
hurt
the
one
he
loved
or
had
loved
or
thought
he
had
loved
how
much
of
his
ideal
of
peace
would
he
be
spreading
that
way
and
this
john
surely
an
innocent
young
man
for
rapture
would
not
have
told
a
mortal
about
her
relation
to
an
immortal
a
man
who
liked
rapture
very
well
who
probably
needed
her
more
than
she
needed
him
and
wanted
to
get
to
know
her
as
well
as
he
could
mym
reversed
his
course
no
he
had
no
need
and
no
desire
to
hurt
rapture
or
her
friend
he
would
set
the
example
that
he
wished
mortals
would
follow
and
accept
the
inevitable
with
what
grace
he
could
muster
he
returned
to
his
castle
and
walked
in
the
garden
severely
out
of
sorts
it
was
true
that
he
and
rapture
had
been
growing
apart
and
her
initiative
had
been
valid
but
he
had
discovered
the
joy
of
loving
and
being
loved
with
orb
and
rediscovered
it
with
rapture
he
could
no
longer
countenance
being
appeared
so
she
dumped
you
she
said
damn
her
except
that
she
was
already
damned
no
thanks
to
you
demoness
he
said
she
was
nt
right
for
you
anyway
lila
said
maybe
she
was
when
you
were
playing
the
prince
princess
game
among
the
mortals
but
not
for
this
situation
you
need
a
woman
who
understandsabout
incarnations
true
i
shall
look
for
one
she
smiled
inhaling
she
now
wore
one
of
her
translucent
outfitsthat
were
more
maddeningly
suggestive
than
full
nudity
would
have
been
no
mortal
will
do
mym
you
need
one
who
is
committed
to
the
afterlife
thanatos
seems
to
do
well
enough
with
a
mortal
thanatos
has
a
quite
remarkable
mortal
there
is
not
another
like
luna
you
err
demoness
there
is
her
cousin
orb
plila
shrugged
eloquently
that
s
right
you
had
an
affair
with
her
did
nt
you
but
back
i
m
not
so
sure
i
loved
her
before
and
she
loved
me
i
could
love
her
again
lila
paced
in
front
of
him
allowing
her
flesh
to
quiver
provocatively
you
finished
that
relationship
when
you
deserted
her
for
another
woman
that
was
not
my
choice
nevertheless
you
left
her
in
a
rather
difficult
situation
you
see
she
was
gravid
gravid
with
child
it
happens
to
mortals
you
know
pregnant
she
could
nt
have
been
verify
it
in
fate
s
threads
mym
she
was
carrying
your
baby
girl
and
she
bore
her
after
you
left
and
gave
her
up
for
adoption
that
rather
finished
that
aspect
of
your
romance
i
doubt
very
much
that
she
would
choose
to
go
through
that
again
but
she
never
said
anything
to
me
she
did
nt
know
it
when
you
deserted
her
mym
was
stricken
of
the
afterlife
do
nt
get
gravid
with
them
it
s
all
pleasure
no
consequence
so
why
do
nt
you
become
sensible
and
do
what
you
have
been
longing
to
do
for
so
long
she
shimmered
and
her
clothing
dissolved
into
mist
she
opened
her
arms
i
can
be
most
accommodating
mym
and
i
make
no
demands
he
looked
at
her
this
creature
of
hell
seemed
on
the
verge
of
victory
at
last
her
body
was
beautiful
but
her
nature
demonic
he
trusted
her
to
serve
her
master
and
her
master
was
satan
he
tasted
the
blood
in
his
mouth
again
this
time
he
let
the
berserker
reflex
take
over
abruptly
he
was
moving
his
great
red
sword
was
out
and
whistling
it
lopped
off
her
head
the
head
flew
up
its
face
surprised
the
body
remained
standing
there
was
no
blood
the
sword
whistled
back
it
lopped
off
the
upper
arms
and
the
top
of
the
torso
cleanly
at
the
the
neck
and
the
tops
of
the
two
breasts
also
bloodlessly
the
nether
sections
of
the
breasts
resembled
two
bowls
filled
precisely
level
with
gray
stuffing
both
sections
of
thatpbosom
were
expanding
for
lila
had
been
inhaling
at
the
moment
of
his
attack
again
the
sword
passed
through
severing
the
body
at
the
slenderwaist
and
again
at
the
genital
region
and
at
the
knees
five
swift
cuts
and
the
body
was
tumbling
in
six
major
segments
which
in
turn
were
fragmenting
as
the
separate
arms
and
legs
fell
skew
in
a
moment
there
was
simply
a
collection
of
items
on
the
ground
in
this
manner
too
i
am
ready
to
serve
you
the
head
said
it
was
lying
to
the
side
where
it
had
bounced
and
rolled
the
truncated
neck
was
up
the
face
inverted
i
just
want
to
be
rid
of
you
mym
gritted
then
stuff
my
parts
in
a
trunk
and
ship
it
straight
to
hell
the
head
was
looking
at
his
sword
and
finding
no
blood
on
the
blade
his
berserker
rage
had
faded
being
replaced
by
bemusement
he
had
known
that
demons
differed
from
people
but
had
not
been
quite
prepared
for
this
use
the
base
of
the
statue
mym
went
to
the
copulating
statue
and
hacked
off
its
figures
the
pedestal
now
manifested
as
a
hollow
chamber
he
sheathed
the
sword
and
wrestled
this
up
it
was
you
torisen
laughed
then
caught
his
breath
sharply
flashing
across
the
road
scarcely
a
dozen
paces
away
was
a
rage
of
five
rathorns
the
lead
stallion
spun
around
to
face
the
host
fangs
bared
sunlight
fell
on
the
blackness
of
his
coat
blazed
off
his
two
horns
and
wealth
of
ivory
every
war
horse
in
the
vanguard
rocked
back
on
its
heels
wild
eyed
not
one
would
have
stood
its
ground
if
the
great
beast
had
charged
instead
he
gave
a
scornfulsnort
and
bounded
over
the
silver
after
his
rage
a
moment
later
all
whole
trinity
breathed
harn
soothing
his
frightened
mount
that
was
quite
an
omen
of
what
i
think
the
emblem
of
my
house
just
laughed
in
my
face
but
where
on
earth
did
they
come
from
he
dismounted
and
followed
the
rathorns
path
clearly
marked
by
trampled
grass
ahead
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
a
vine
covered
cliff
face
as
he
drew
nearer
however
torisen
saw
darkness
behind
the
leaves
he
pushed
the
vines
aside
behind
them
was
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
high
vaulted
lined
with
smooth
expertly
fitted
stones
the
shaft
seemed
to
go
back
a
long
long
way
its
cold
breath
heavy
with
the
smells
of
earth
and
rathorn
breathed
in
his
face
a
faint
confused
murmurarose
from
the
black
distance
almost
like
the
sound
of
voices
hello
is
anyone
there
his
voice
echoed
back
harshly
again
and
again
and
again
he
caught
his
breath
feeling
as
if
he
then
somewhere
far
far
away
someone
called
his
name
the
unburnt
dead
come
for
you
out
of
darkness
calling
calling
and
if
you
answer
you
are
lost
but
that
was
only
how
he
and
jame
used
to
frighten
each
other
as
children
it
was
just
a
silly
game
born
out
of
a
stupidpsuperstition
about
as
stupid
as
believing
that
someone
down
there
in
the
dark
actually
knew
his
name
harn
called
to
him
from
the
road
blackie
here
comes
ardeth
the
lord
of
omiroth
was
riding
up
toward
the
vanguard
on
his
gray
whinno
hir
mare
brithany
a
matriarch
of
the
herd
and
storm
s
granddam
kindrie
the
two

scrollsmen
and
ardeth
s
war
guard
followed
him
at
a
distance
harn
grunted
confrontation
time
huh
i
d
better
take
myself
off
then
he
cantered
back
toward
the
main
body
of
the
host
saluting
ardeth
as
he
passed
torisen
swung
back
up
onto
storm
and
waited
not
without
some
trepidation
older
man
had
dressed
him
down
for
not
honoringhis
obligation
to
kindrie
my
lord
my
lady
he
included
both
highborn
and
horse
in
a
wary
salute
ardeth
to
his
surprise
looked
almost
embarrassed
my
boy
it
seems
i
owe
you
an
apology
i
did
nt
know
that
the
changer
who
attacked
you
at
tentir
was
a
shanir
much
less
that
he
was
bound
to
a
darkling
wyrm
kindrie
saw
the
wyrm
good
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
i
d
imagined
it
but
he
waited
this
long
to
tell
you
you
never
told
me
at
all
said
ardeth
a
trifle
sharply
still
what
cursed
luck
that
it
was
a
shanir
the
old
blood
can
be
dangerous
it
opens
us
up
to
god
born
powers
few
of
us
still
know
how
to
control
but
is
it
necessarily
so
foul
a
thing
say
to
share
senses
with
an
animal
now
if
it
were
brithany
here
instead
of
some
crawling
no
said
torisen
and
gave
a
startled
yelp
as
the
mare
nipped
his
leg
sorry
my
lady
forgive
me
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
she
made
as
if
to
snap
at
his
fingers
but
only
grazed
them
with
a
velvet
lip
you
always
were
one
of
her
favorites
said
ardeth
smiling
that
was
in
part
why
i
took
a
chance
on
you
in
the
first
place
so
that
s
why
you
introduced
us
that
first
night
the
lord
of
omiroth
taking
advice
from
a
gray
mare
hey
storm
growing
jealous
had
turned
to
snap
at
ardeth
s
foot
brithany
put
back
her
ears
her
grand
colt
subsided
chastened
and
a
bit
sulky
the
idiot
child
said
ardeth
regarding
him
coolly
why
do
nt
you
look
for
a
full
blooded
whinno
hir
i
know
of
at
least
one
three
year
old
in
the
herd
who
would
be
honored
to
bear
you
even
a
battle
storm
does
besides
he
ll
take
me
straight
through
a
stone
wall
if
i
ask
him
to
without
an
argument
as
i
said
an
idiot
look
across
the
river
a
flight
of
azure
winged
butterflies
rose
from
the
tall
grass
at
the
sound
of
the
horses
hooves
then
settled
back
again
out
of
sight
jewel
jaws
said
torisen
absently
there
must
be
somethingdead
in
the
grass
he
peered
ahead
down
the
road
holly
sbeen
gone
a
long
time
i
sent
him
ahead
to
check
out
the
next
post
station
you
expect
trouble
i
do
nt
really
know
we
should
have
had
news
from
the
south
before
now
unless
the
post
rider
has
been
waylaid
somewhere
along
the
line
or
no
one
escaped
to
send
word
ardeth
concluded
bleakly
he
turned
to
watch
two
more
swarms
of
butterflies
dancing
above
the
grass
then
gave
himself
a
shake
your
pardon
my
boy
much
of
death
this
post
system
of
yours
is
really
remarkable
imagine
news
from
the
far
side
of
rathillien
in
only
ten
days
of
course
if
you
put
the
shanir
to
work
on
it
they
might
come
up
with
something
even
faster
no
ah
well
have
it
your
way
it
must
be
quite
a
job
though
protecting
stations
in
this
wilderness
i
have
an
arrangement
with
the
local
warlord
one
grisharki
if
he
were
a
grindark
like
his
followers
i
would
trust
him
more
but
he
comes
from
the
ebonbane
and
boasts
that
he
was
the
lieutenant
of
some
famous
brigand
there
named
bortis
grindark
ardeth
repeated
thoughtfully
an
odd
people
that
with
an
even
odder
connection
to
us
because
they
re
supposed
to
have
been
the
builders
workmen
torisen
asked
oh
her
on
impulse
the
way
husbands
drake
never
did
and
he
did
nt
now
he
merely
held
her
close
and
whispered
why
are
you
so
inter
ested
his
hand
was
almost
brutally
hard
upon
the
nape
of
her
neck
so
that
she
stiffened
and
tried
to
draw
back
her
voice
was
more
than
a
whisper
now
stop
it
drake
he
said
i
want
no
questions
from
you
and
no
interference
you
do
your
job
and
i
ll
do
mine
the
nature
of
my
job
is
open
and
known
the
nature
of
my
job
he
retorted
is
nt
by
definition
but
i
ll
tell
you
this
our
six
legged
friend
is
here
in
this
house
for
some
definite
reason
you
were
nt
picked
as
biologist
in
charge
for
any
random
reason
do
you
know
that
two
days
ago
he
d
been
inquiring
about
me
at
the
commission
you
re
joking
do
nt
believe
that
for
a
minute
there
are
that
s
my
job
and
i
wo
nt
discuss
it
with
you
any
further
do
you
understand
no
but
i
wo
nt
question
you
if
you
do
nt
want
me
to
then
go
to
sleep
she
lay
stiffly
on
her
back
and
the
minutes
passed
and
then
the
quarter
hours
she
was
trying
to
fit
the
pieces
together
even
with
what
drake
had
told
her
the
curves
and
colors
refused
to
blend
she
wondered
what
drake
would
say
if
he
knew
she
had
a
recording
of
that
night
s
conversation
one
picture
remained
clear
in
her
mind
at
that
moment
it
hovered
over
her
mockingly
the
hawkinsite
at
the
end
of
the
long
evening
had
turned
to
her
and
said
gravely
good
night
mrs
smollett
you
are
a
most
charming
hostess
she
had
desperately
wanted
to
giggle
at
the
time
how
could
he
call
her
a
charming
hostess
to
him
she
could
only
be
a
horror
a
monstrosity
with
too
as
the
hawkinsite
delivered
himself
of
this
completely
meaningless
piece
of
politeness
drake
had
turned
white
for
one
instant
his
eyes
had
burned
with
something
that
looked
like
terror
she
had
never
before
known
drake
to
show
fear
of
anything
and
t
t
e
picture
of
that
instant
of
pure
panic
remained
with
her
until
all
her
thoughts
finally
sagged
into
the
oblivion
of
sleep
it
was
noon
before
rose
was
at
her
desk
the
next
day
she
had
deliberately
waited
until
drake
and
the
hawkinsite
had
left
since
only
t
hen
was
she
able
to
remove
the
small
recorder
that
had
been
behind
drake
s
armchair
the
previous
evening
she
had
had
no
original
intention
of
keeping
its
presence
secret
from
him
it
was
just
that
he
had
come
home
so
late
and
she
could
nt
say
anything
about
it
with
the
hawkinsite
present
later
on
of
course
things
had
changed
the
placing
of
the
recorder
had
been
only
a
routine
maneuver
the
ilawkinsite
s
statements
and
intonations
needed
to
be
preserved
for
future
intensive
studies
hidden
in
order
to
avoid
the
distortions
of
self
consciousness
that
the
visibility
of
such
a
device
would
bring
and
now
it
could
nt
be
shown
to
the
members
of
the
institute
at
all
it
would
have
to
serve
a
different
function
altogether
a
rather
nasty
function
she
was
going
to
spy
on
drake
she
touched
the
little
box
with
her
fingers
and
wondered
irrelevantly
how
drake
was
going
to
manage
that
day
social
intercourse
between
inhabited
worlds
was
even
now
not
so
commonplace
that
the
sight
of
a
hawkinsite
on
the
city
streets
would
not
succeed
in
drawing
crowds
but
drake
would
manage
she
knew
drake
always
managed
she
listened
once
again
to
the
sounds
of
last
evening
repeating
the
interesting
moments
she
was
dissatisfied
with
what
drake
had
told
her
why
should
the
hawkinsite
have
been
interested
in
the
two
of
them
particularly
yet
drake
would
nt
lie
she
would
have
liked
to
check
at
the
security
commission
but
she
knew
she
could
not
do
that
besides
definitely
not
lie
but
then
again
why
should
harg
tholan
not
have
investigated
them
he
might
have
inquired
similarly
about
the
families
of
all
the
biologists
at
the
institute
it
would
be
no
more
than
natural
to
attempt
to
choose
the
home
he
would
find
most
pleasant
by
his
own
standards
whatever
they
were
and
if
he
had
even
if
he
had
investigated
only
the
smollettswhy
should
that
create
the
great
change
in
drake
from
intense
hostility
to
intense
interest
drake
undoubtedly
had
knowledge
he
was
keeping
to
himself
only
heaven
knew
how
much
her
thoughts
churned
slowly
through
the
possibilities
of
interstellar
intrigue
so
far
to
be
sure
there
were
no
signs
of
hostility
or
ill
feeling
among
any
of
the
five
intelligent
races
known
to
inhabit
the
galaxy
as
yet
they
were
spaced
at
intervals
too
wide
for
enmity
even
the
barest
contact
among
them
was
all
but
impossible
economic
and
political
interests
just
had
no
point
at
which
to
conflict
but
that
was
only
her
idea
and
she
was
not
conflict
if
there
were
danger
if
there
were
any
reason
to
suspect
that
the
mission
of
a
hawkinsite
might
be
other
than
peaceful
drake
would
know
yet
was
drake
sufficiently
high
in
the
councils
of
the
security
commission
to
know
off
hand
the
dangers
involved
in
the
visit
of
a
hawkinsite
physician
she
had
never
thought
of
his
position
as
more
than
that
of
a
very
minor
functionary
in
the
commission
he
had
never
presented
himself
as
more
and
yet
might
he
be
more
she
shrugged
at
the
thought
it
was
reminiscent
of
twentieth
century
spy
novels
and
of
costume
dramas
of
the
days
when
there
existed
such
things
as
atom
bomb
secrets
the
thought
of
costume
dramas
decided
her
unlike
drake
she
was
nt
a
real
policeman
and
she
did
nt
know
how
a
real
policeman
would
go
about
it
but
she
knew
how
such
things
were
done
in
the
old
dramas
she
drew
a
piece
of
paper
toward
her
and
with
wo
nt
be
here
we
lost
her
two
years
ago
she
was
crossing
the
medina
in
a
buggy
with
brother
mitchell
and
some
water
splashed
on
her
she
caught
a
chill
and
it
turned
into
lung
fever
i
m
sorry
to
have
to
be
the
one
to
tell
you
this
i
just
wish
that
you
could
have
come
home
after
the
war
was
over
it
would
have
meant
ever
so
much
to
mama
to
see
you
again
do
nt
misunderstand
me
johnny
i
m
not
blaming
you
for
anything
not
coming
home
but
we
ve
all
missed
you
so
much
please
come
now
if
you
can
always
your
loving
sister
mary
finally
one
afternoon
in
early
april
he
topped
out
on
a
low
ridge
that
overlooked
the
ringgold
farm
a
man
was
plowing
in
the
lower
field
by
the
creek
even
at
a
distance
he
could
tell
that
the
man
was
well
above
average
stature
there
was
something
curious
about
the
way
he
was
plowing
and
after
a
minute
or
so
john
made
out
that
he
had
only
one
arm
he
had
himself
strapped
to
the
plow
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
manage
it
with
his
single
arm
but
obviously
it
was
a
feat
beyond
the
strength
of
an
ordinary
man
only
someone
like
clayton
who
had
more
strength
in
one
arm
than
most
men
had
in
two
could
keep
a
straight
furrow
with
that
handicap
rememberingmary
s
letter
and
deeply
moved
by
the
sight
of
clayton
struggling
with
the
soil
and
his
handicap
john
dismounted
and
watched
him
for
saw
a
woman
come
out
into
the
field
carrying
a
pitcher
with
her
was
a
tiny
figure
in
a
dress
matching
her
own
slowly
the
woman
trussed
the
plowed
field
leading
the
little
girl
by
the
hand
claytonpembraced
the
woman
with
his
one
arm
and
then
stooped
to
lift
his
daughter
after
the
woman
and
her
daughter
returned
to
the
house
john
noticed
a
young
boy
walking
along
the
deep
muddy
ruts
of
the
road
from
town
over
his
shoulder
he
bore
a
satchel
and
since
he
entered
the
farmhouse
it
was
nt
hard
to
guess
that
he
was
clayton
s
stepson
home
from
school
the
farm
had
never
looked
so
lovely
to
him
house
and
barn
were
both
freshly
painted
and
beneath
the
windows
of
the
house
with
their
bright
blue
shutters
were
flower
boxes
the
surrounding
fields
watered
by
abundant
spring
rains
were
bright
green
as
green
as
missouri
and
there
were
swatches
of
wild
flowers
poppies
lupines
daisies
paintbrush
along
the
creek
the
cottonwoods
he
supposed
that
it
had
always
been
this
lovely
in
the
spring
but
as
a
youngster
longing
to
escape
confinement
here
he
had
seen
none
of
its
beauty
he
finally
swung
onto
his
horse
and
rode
down
to
where
clayton
was
plowing
the
fear
of
being
discovered
was
still
with
him
but
as
he
felt
his
brother
crushing
him
in
a
one
armed
embrace
his
yearning
to
be
with
his
family
again
overcame
every
other
feeling
my
god
big
brother
where
have
you
been
more
places
than
i
care
to
remember
clayton
he
said
nearly
choking
mary
said
you
d
be
back
but
we
did
nt
believe
her
you
never
wrote
us
i
know
clayton
during
the
war
i
could
nt
and
after
that
i
just
did
nt
but
i
wo
nt
stop
writing
again
believe
me
it
do
nt
matter
big
brother
you
re
here
now
and
you
ai
nt
leavin
us
again
clayton
unharnessed
himself
from
the
plow
and
led
his
brother
across
the
plowed
field
to
the
house
on
the
porch
they
were
met
by
a
small
pretty
woman
with
eyes
as
blue
as
the
cloudless
sky
above
them
and
a
piled
up
mass
of
hair
as
bright
gold
as
a
halo
clinging
to
her
skirts
was
a
little
girl
of
four
or
five
who
with
her
combed
out
burnished
auburn
locks
and
big
inquisitive
green
eyes
was
a
miniature
of
judith
ringgold
mary
had
nt
exaggerated
the
resemblance
you
re
johnny
the
girl
s
mother
said
before
clayton
slow
spoken
as
always
even
had
a
chance
to
introduce
them
clayton
and
your
sisters
have
never
stopped
talking
about
you
welcome
home
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
smiled
warmly
i
m
linda
she
addressed
the
little
girl
beside
her
judith
this
is
your
uncle
johnny
pas
he
dropped
to
his
heels
on
the
porch
step
so
that
he
and
she
could
look
at
each
other
eye
to
eye
expression
of
the
very
young
encountering
strangers
john
ringgoldwas
filled
with
an
almost
unbearable
warm
sensation
and
just
barely
managed
to
resist
the
impulse
to
take
the
child
in
his
arms
first
he
would
teach
her
to
smile
at
him
however
long
it
took
then
he
would
take
her
hand
and
if
she
reached
out
to
him
after
that
he
would
lift
her
in
his
arms
it
did
nt
take
long
for
the
little
girl
to
warm
up
to
her
uncle
during
the
days
that
followed
as
he
worked
at
various
chores
to
make
things
easier
for
his
brother
clearing
an
irrigation
ditch
from
the
creek
mending
harness
replacing
fence
posts
she
was
constantly
nearby
watching
him
chattering
endlessly
about
the
activities
of
all
the
creatures
on
the
farm
around
her
from
her
pet
turtle
frank
to
an
expecting
mother
cat
and
the
milk
cows
you
want
one
of
melissa
s
kittens
do
nt
you
johnny
she
never
called
him
uncle
of
course
take
care
of
it
i
ll
be
leaving
here
soon
you
ll
have
to
take
care
of
it
for
me
why
do
you
have
to
leave
daddy
wants
you
to
stay
i
know
he
does
and
mama
too
i
wish
i
could
stay
judith
he
told
her
truthfully
just
being
with
his
brother
s
family
gave
him
a
happiness
he
had
not
known
since
his
long
visits
with
the
youngers
before
the
war
watching
them
together
seeing
how
linda
s
son
accepted
clayton
as
a
father
separated
from
her
by
less
than
the
length
of
an
arm
i
was
struck
by
the
contrast
between
this
place
and
those
in
which
i
had
spent
the
rest
of
this
day
first
yontsdown
with
its
smokestacks
and
medieval
buildings
and
omnipresent
sense
of
impending
doom
then
the
midway
with
its
gaudy
pleasures
and
swarms
of
marks
it
was
a
relief
now
to
pass
a
little
time
in
a
place
where
there
was
no
proof
of
man
s
existence
other
than
the
dirt
road
leading
in
which
we
kept
at
our
backs
and
which
i
tried
to
put
out
of
mind
gregarious
by
nature
there
nevertheless
were
occasions
when
i
became
as
weary
of
the
company
of
other
human
beings
as
i
was
repelled
and
disgusted
by
the
goblins
and
sometimes
one
another
as
the
marks
had
been
in
joel
tuck
s
sideshow
tent
that
very
day
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
deserved
the
goblins
that
we
were
a
tragically
flawed
race
incapable
of
adequately
appreciating
the
miracle
of
our
existence
and
that
we
had
earned
the
vicious
attentions
of
the
goblins
by
our
own
despicable
actions
against
one
another
after
all
many
of
the
gods
we
worshiped
were
to
one
degree
or
another
judgmental
and
demanding
and
capable
of
heart
stopping
cruelty
who
could
say
that
they
might
not
visit
a
plague
of
goblins
on
us
and
call
it
just
punishment
for
sins
indulged
here
in
the
tranquillity
of
the
forest
however
a
cleansing
energy
washed
through
me
and
gradually
i
began
to
feel
better
in
spite
of
all
the
talk
of
graveyards
and
nightmares
with
which
we
had
occupied
ourselves
then
after
a
while
i
became
aware
that
rya
was
weeping
she
made
no
sound
and
her
body
was
not
racked
with
silent
sobs
i
was
alerted
to
her
condition
only
when
sadness
welling
up
anew
in
her
looking
sidewise
i
saw
a
glistening
tear
tracking
down
her
smooth
cheek
another
spot
of
silver
in
the
moonlight
what
s
wrong
i
asked
she
shook
her
head
do
nt
want
to
talk
she
shook
her
head
again
acutely
aware
that
she
needed
comforting
that
she
had
come
to
me
expressly
for
comforting
but
not
knowing
how
to
provide
it
i
turned
my
eyes
from
her
and
looked
out
at
the
oily
blackness
of
the
lake
she
shorted
out
my
logic
circuits
damn
it
she
was
different
from
anyone
i
had
ever
known
with
puzzling
depths
and
dark
secrets
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
dared
not
respond
to
her
as
casually
and
forthrightly
as
i
would
have
responded
to
anyone
else
i
felt
as
if
i
were
an
astronaut
making
first
contact
with
an
alien
from
another
world
overwhelmed
by
an
appreciation
for
the
gulf
between
us
afraid
to
proceed
lest
the
initial
communication
be
misunderstood
therefore
to
act
i
told
myself
that
i
had
been
foolish
to
dream
of
heating
the
coolness
between
us
that
i
had
been
an
idiot
for
imagining
that
a
close
relationship
with
her
was
possible
that
i
had
gotten
in
over
my
head
with
this
one
that
these
waters
were
too
dark
and
strange
that
i
would
never
understand
her
and
and
then
she
kissed
me
she
pressed
her
pliant
lips
to
mine
and
her
mouth
opened
to
me
and
i
returned
her
kiss
with
a
passion
i
had
never
experienced
before
our
tongues
seeking
and
melting
together
until
i
could
not
tell
hers
from
mine
i
put
both
hands
in
her
glorious
hair
an
auburn
blond
mix
in
daylight
but
now
argentine
and
let
it
run
through
my
fingers
it
felt
the
way
spun
moonlight
might
feel
if
it
could
be
fashioned
into
a
cool
and
silken
thread
i
touched
her
face
and
the
texture
of
her
skin
sent
a
shiver
through
me
i
slid
my
hands
lower
along
her
neck
holding
her
by
the
her
full
breasts
from
the
moment
she
had
leaned
against
me
and
had
given
that
first
kiss
she
had
been
shaking
i
sensed
that
these
were
not
tremors
of
erotic
anticipation
but
were
evidence
of
an
uncertainty
awkwardness
shyness
and
fear
of
rejection
not
dissimilar
to
my
own
state
of
mind
now
suddenly
a
stronger
shiver
passed
through
her
she
pulled
away
from
me
and
said
oh
hell
what
i
asked
breathless
why
ca
nt
what
two
people
what
tears
streamed
down
her
face
now
her
voice
quavered
just
reach
out
to
each
other
you
reached
i
reached
and
push
aside
that
barrier
there
s
no
barrier
not
now
i
sensed
that
sadness
in
her
a
well
of
loneliness
too
deep
to
be
plumbed
a
grayness
an
apartness
and
i
was
afraid
that
moment
force
upon
us
the
very
estrangement
that
she
professed
to
fear
she
said
it
s
there
always
there
always
so
hard
to
make
any
real
contact
any
real
it
s
easy
i
said
no
we
re
more
than
halfway
a
pit
a
gulf
shut
up
i
said
as
gently
and
lovingly
as
i
had
ever
said
two
words
and
i
took
hold
of
her
again
kissed
her
again
we
kissed
and
caressed
with
rapidly
increasing
fervor
but
with
a
determination
to
savor
this
first
exploration
although
we
must
have
sat
there
on
the
grass
for
no
more
than
five
or
ten
minutes
it
seemed
that
whole
days
passed
unheeded
when
she
again
pulled
away
from
me
i
started
to
protest
but
she
said
hush
in
such
a
way
that
i
knew
i
should
be
quiet
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
with
bring
a
chill
to
ardor
her
clothes
slipped
away
from
her
and
she
stood
thrillingly
revealed
even
at
night
in
this
dark
woods
she
seemed
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
sun
for
moonglow
was
nothing
more
than
a
reflection
of
solar
light
and
now
every
beam
of
that
secondhand
sunshine
appeared
to
find
its
way
to
her
the
rays
of
the
moon
made
her
skin
translucent
and
accentuated
the
exquisitely
sensuous
curves
and
planes
convexities
and
concavities
of
terrain
mama
made
for
the
humming
was
louder
as
she
reached
the
water
it
came
around
a
bend
upstream
she
could
nt
see
the
intruder
s
shape
it
was
too
distant
yet
but
it
moved
on
the
water
not
through
it
moved
fast
finally
mama
s
eyes
were
above
the
water
the
snorkel
between
her
eyes
drew
air
her
lungs
heaved
there
was
rage
in
her
and
something
else
sphincter
muscles
relaxed
back
of
her
neck
speed
began
dripping
into
her
blood
and
her
entire
body
began
to
fizz
the
vulnerable
snorkel
withdrew
into
her
head
sic
watched
the
intruder
come
not
quite
toward
her
she
had
nt
been
seen
yet
then
why
was
the
intruder
already
fast
but
mama
was
fast
now
and
she
moved
this
was
her
territory
now
she
knew
it
that
well
she
had
been
here
that
long
mine
she
too
was
almost
above
the
water
as
she
reached
the
intruder
she
struck
from
the
side
for
a
bare
instant
she
knew
that
a
taste
like
metal
but
not
as
strong
ruptured
on
impact
and
tore
in
her
jaws
no
meaty
texture
no
taste
of
blood
not
won
lost
tricked
and
where
was
her
enemy
the
metallic
skin
filled
with
water
and
began
to
sink
confusing
tastes
drifted
in
its
wake
things
thrashed
the
water
in
slow
motion
beasts
caught
between
fighters
she
ignored
them
where
was
her
rival
still
fast
mama
streaked
for
her
cave
before
she
could
be
blindsided
at
the
underwater
mouth
she
turned
she
could
nt
be
attacked
now
except
from
the
front
now
there
was
time
mama
lifted
her
eyes
above
the
water
and
watched
two
beasts
thrashing
if
meat
were
suddenly
snatched
beneath
the
surface
she
would
know
that
her
enemy
was
below
but
the
prey
were
swept
downstream
thrashing
trying
to
reach
the
river
s
edge
they
reached
shore
unmolested
and
scrambled
from
the
water
unmolested
mama
had
been
tricked
she
had
bitten
something
but
it
was
nt
meat
the
other
it
skimmed
across
the
water
almost
toward
her
it
swerved
away
as
mama
streaked
toward
it
the
intruder
was
fully
on
speed
and
young
mama
thought
she
herself
had
never
moved
so
fast
but
its
turn
was
too
slow
she
was
on
it
and
her
teeth
closed
with
terrible
strength
on
thin
tough
tasteless
skin
and
flesh
that
ruptured
and
bone
that
broke
fragile
bone
prey
blood
prey
meat
with
no
taste
of
speed
not
at
all
the
flesh
of
her
own
kind
and
she
d
been
tricked
again
she
had
barely
slowed
she
kept
moving
fleeing
the
site
of
her
kill
curving
toward
safety
sliding
across
the
bucking
surface
of
the
water
where
is
my
enemy
where
behind
her
meat
thrashed
in
the
water
then
subsided
more
prey
was
climbing
the
cliff
unmolested
and
that
was
hardly
surprising
in
the
middle
of
a
duel
one
does
not
pause
to
dine
how
may
i
lure
s
prey
challenge
carlos
martinez
was
shaking
with
cold
with
shock
and
pain
from
the
fractured
cheekbone
and
the
flap
of
scalp
torn
away
when
he
wrapped
himself
around
bobbi
s
unconscious
body
to
shield
her
from
the
rocks
she
lay
curled
on
her
side
flat
stomach
spasming
river
water
still
trickling
in
a
brown
stream
from
her
mouth
eyes
glazed
but
open
and
wandering
blindly
alive
vivo
flashed
insanely
into
his
mind
alive
vivo
scrambling
his
thoughts
she
was
in
shock
and
probably
concussed
but
all
that
really
mattered
for
the
moment
was
that
she
was
alive
he
gripped
his
head
tightly
fighting
the
ringing
and
the
pain
in
a
few
moments
they
quieted
and
he
massaged
bobbi
s
rib
cage
firmly
as
he
looked
about
him
later
in
the
year
when
the
snow
from
the
northern
mountains
melted
the
spot
he
stood
on
and
another
thirty
meters
of
tumbled
rock
would
be
submerged
in
another
ninety
days
there
might
not
he
and
bobbi
might
have
been
dashed
against
steeply
sloping
walls
of
naked
rock
a
few
hundred
meters
north
or
south
the
water
dashed
against
sheer
cliff
as
bad
and
barren
as
this
shelf
was
it
still
represented
something
very
near
a
miracle
he
would
have
to
fight
rapids
or
climb
to
get
off
the
beach
he
managed
a
quick
prayer
of
thanks
that
he
would
nt
have
to
try
rescue
would
come
soon
thank
goodness
for
the
holo
links
the
camp
would
have
seen
exactly
what
happened
his
head
throbbed
he
kept
up
the
steady
gentle
massage
on
bobbi
s
ribcage
her
eyes
fluttered
open
weakly
carlos
what
happened
we
hit
a
rock
that
had
to
be
it
that
was
all
that
it
could
be
so
why
was
there
a
wet
red
flag
on
part
of
the
memory
something
trying
to
hide
from
him
and
warn
him
at
the
same
instant
carlos
ripped
his
shirt
off
and
wiped
her
face
with
it
she
under
her
head
not
long
now
elliot
falkland
would
be
fighting
upriver
even
now
he
managed
a
smile
to
think
of
the
rotund
engineer
piloting
his
way
through
the
rapids
bobbi
would
have
treatment
within
the
hour
and
tomorrow
they
would
be
able
to
laugh
about
this
the
colony
would
already
be
sending
out
skeeters
he
thought
that
he
could
hear
the
hum
of
a
distant
engine
i
ll
be
right
back
chiquita
he
said
and
kissed
her
softly
her
lips
felt
bruised
and
flushed
she
reached
for
him
gripped
at
the
wet
cloth
of
his
shirt
no
do
nt
leave
me
please
there
was
help
out
in
the
river
it
tore
him
but
he
pried
her
fingers
loose
shh
shh
i
love
you
i
ll
be
right
back
i
promise
o
k
shaking
unconvinced
she
nodded
her
head
carlos
scrambled
over
the
rocks
to
the
south
to
a
higher
point
where
he
could
see
the
the
rush
of
the
water
silver
white
with
dark
patches
as
it
exploded
over
rocks
and
took
sudden
dips
and
turns
to
either
side
the
mountain
walls
were
steep
at
least
should
hold
our
discussion
for
a
bit
his
voice
was
very
suddenly
cautious
i
snapped
off
the
disk
and
stuffed
the
stethoscope
in
a
pocket
i
started
out
of
the
alley
toward
the
back
this
time
walking
fairly
fast
an
innocent
wanderer
who
d
gotten
a
little
lost
maybe
with
dirty
clothing
i
got
to
the
back
of
the
place
the
back
door
opened
and
people
came
pouring
out
maybe
others
were
covering
the
front
i
missed
but
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
people
in
that
place
before
the
first
guest
of
the
day
arrived
or
maybe
they
just
got
up
earlier
than
i
did
i
ran
like
a
rabbit
zig
zagging
as
i
went
behind
the
hq
was
an
empty
field
fine
for
target
practice
i
found
a
bush
somebody
beamed
high
over
my
head
i
snapped
off
a
beam
myself
maybe
they
were
using
paralysis
weapons
i
did
nt
even
carry
a
slug
gun
why
give
anybody
nasty
ideas
and
beams
come
in
all
sorts
i
left
the
bush
heading
right
and
then
left
another
beam
went
by
me
the
end
of
the
field
was
an
empty
street
i
hit
it
turned
and
raised
my
own
beamer
i
never
felt
sillier
in
my
life
for
two
seconds
i
was
the
original
sitting
duck
somebody
potted
the
duck
as
i
went
into
freeze
paralysis
for
sure
and
thank
you
lord
i
hoped
it
had
nt
been
the
freeze
is
supposed
to
be
an
entirely
new
state
for
the
human
body
something
that
never
existed
before
the
paralysis
beam
i
m
not
about
to
argue
with
that
and
there
have
been
lots
of
inventions
that
brought
along
their
own
entirely
new
states
anesthesia
for
one
but
it
feels
exactly
like
being
knocked
cold
you
even
wake
up
with
a
headache
this
they
tell
me
is
due
to
the
distortion
effect
of
the
radiative
field
it
is
just
like
the
ache
you
get
when
you
ve
been
knocked
cold
except
that
it
has
no
specific
place
to
be
not
the
back
of
the
head
or
just
over
the
ear
or
whatever
it
aches
all
over
no
worse
than
a
bad
hangover
and
i
thought
i
could
be
courageous
about
it
and
open
my
eyes
for
one
thing
i
wanted
to
see
what
i
was
fastened
to
surprise
surprise
it
turned
out
to
be
an
electric
chair
i
swear
the
thing
looked
like
one
of
museum
cap
over
my
head
little
straps
holding
my
arms
and
legs
down
the
whole
works
all
we
needed
was
a
last
meal
and
a
chaplain
the
man
looking
at
me
had
to
be
dvorkin
carshin
he
turned
out
to
be
the
guy
in
the
white
clothes
and
hat
the
short
fat
man
i
d
seen
arrive
earlier
he
had
an
expression
on
his
face
i
did
nt
like
at
all
he
was
serenely
confident
well
then
he
said
you
have
awakened
i
ve
been
unfrozen
if
that
s
what
you
mean
i
said
a
voice
behind
me
female
said
awake
for
one
point
six
seconds
before
his
eyes
opened
apparently
there
were
several
large
readout
machines
back
there
i
could
nt
turn
my
head
to
see
hell
i
could
barely
wiggle
my
fingers
he
is
moving
one
hand
the
female
behind
me
reported
not
really
precise
machines
i
d
only
wiggled
three
i
can
see
that
he
is
awake
and
moving
carshin
said
what
else
have
you
to
tell
me
reaction
time
exceptionally
fast
she
said
the
usual
lag
between
waking
and
opening
the
eyes
is
nearly
eight
seconds
sometimes
longer
these
readings
do
nt
become
irritated
dear
girl
carshin
said
i
realize
the
value
of
your
device
after
all
i
am
its
most
constant
user
there
was
a
little
silence
physical
states
stable
she
said
high
oxygenation
exceptionally
rapid
secondaries
in
the
delta
area
i
d
heard
for
years
that
if
you
concentrated
hard
you
could
lower
your
blood
pressure
change
your
heartbeat
do
all
sorts
of
things
like
that
one
of
the
laboratory
tricks
of
the
ancients
that
kept
looking
as
if
it
were
going
to
turn
into
something
useful
though
it
apparently
never
had
i
concentrated
on
trying
to
make
the
machine
spell
obscene
words
in
the
local
it
could
write
letters
why
not
carshin
looked
at
me
i
looked
back
what
is
your
name
he
said
why
he
smiled
he
raised
one
finger
a
conductor
cueing
in
a
flute
my
head
exploded
he
was
saying
that
is
why
sir
before
it
cleared
it
did
clear
eventually
in
about
ten
years
if
you
put
it
that
way
i
said
gerald
knave
carshin
said
and
what
do
you
he
was
interrupted
there
was
a
small
knot
of
people
away
over
at
my
left
whom
i
had
nt
had
time
for
some
i
d
seen
before
one
of
the
female
twins
for
instance
others
had
apparently
been
in
the
place
all
along
it
was
the
female
twin
who
spoke
up
i
deduced
at
once
that
the
other
one
was
the
girl
behind
me
at
the
readout
boards
this
one
had
the
same
voice
in
a
enough
those
two
i
remember
to
this
day
as
among
the
really
sizable
exceptions
gerald
knave
the
twin
said
carshin
have
you
not
heard
of
this
man
the
fat
man
s
eyebrows
went
up
frankly
he
said
never
he
looked
at
me
again
i
gave
him
a
shrug
as
much
as
i
could
manage
in
tight
quarters
i
did
nt
resent
his
never
page
deleted
page
deleted
this
time
it
took
a
little
longer
for
my
head
to
clear
now
he
was
saying
do
you
understand
me
knave
sure
i
said
my
voice
sounded
a
little
thick
which
irritated
me
i
ve
had
worse
things
happen
to
me
than
exploding
heads
at
that
moment
i
could
nt
think
of
any
very
well
carshin
said
an
operative
of
your
distinction
apparently
you
have
a
certain
distinction
would
not
have
been
sent
out
on
a
morning
perhaps
you
knew
what
the
city
in
a
few
years
i
do
nt
care
what
that
gombeen
man
fears
i
m
not
involved
in
any
of
your
nonsense
so
you
are
not
part
of
any
of
them
the
carbine
was
almost
in
a
position
where
he
might
survive
the
first
shot
i
hate
to
mention
it
but
i
did
save
you
from
the
hordi
supper
table
last
night
a
fact
that
seems
to
have
escaped
your
ladyship
s
attention
that
could
have
been
part
of
the
plot
she
responded
stubbornly
me
girl
maybe
it
is
all
a
plot
you
re
either
going
to
shoot
me
or
not
decide
for
yourself
if
you
think
you
re
going
to
be
able
to
bring
these
kids
of
yours
down
to
hyperion
with
just
the
help
of
a
bangedup
old
noncom
and
a
kid
who
should
be
in
the
classroom
you
re
crazy
maybe
you
do
nt
want
to
trust
me
i
do
nt
care
much
but
you
ve
got
to
trust
someone
i
m
the
only
one
around
who
can
be
of
much
help
now
get
out
of
my
tent
unless
you
have
foul
designs
on
my
body
in
which
case
welcome
i
need
some
sleep
he
rolled
over
moderately
confident
that
she
would
nt
shoot
o
neill
her
voice
came
plaintively
from
the
entrance
of
the
tent
what
now
he
demanded
impatiently
got
her
i
am
thankful
to
you
for
rescuing
me
from
the
uh
supper
table
well
praise
umcile
it
only
took
twenty
four
hours
to
get
it
out
of
your
mouth
may
all
those
wonderful
friends
of
your
god
be
with
this
tent
well
now
was
nt
that
nice
and
so
poor
retha
s
on
this
crazy
adventure
because
she
s
a
dangerous
revolutionary
i
ve
seen
more
dangerous
firebrands
in
the
nursery
on
the
iona
it
was
long
after
dark
on
the
next
day
when
they
crossed
the
line
of
dunes
that
separated
beach
from
desert
the
ocean
water
looked
inviting
serene
blue
topped
by
great
white
rolling
surf
but
it
was
bitter
cold
so
there
was
no
refreshment
there
o
neill
contemplated
what
lay
before
them
it
was
still
a
long
walk
to
hyperion
all
they
had
to
fear
was
the
committee
narth
the
young
ones
the
hooded
ones
the
hordi
how
many
other
dangers
were
there
that
no
one
had
seen
fit
to
tell
him
about
margie
said
the
commander
of
the
fort
was
a
man
of
the
highest
integrity
who
would
have
there
would
be
respite
there
even
if
they
made
it
they
were
bound
to
return
to
the
city
o
neill
yearned
for
just
one
small
gunship
the
tom
doherty
perhaps
a
speedy
and
powerful
craft
to
help
blast
this
whole
planet
into
shape
deirdre
my
lady
how
did
you
get
me
into
this
there
s
no
answer
there
never
is
you
ve
forgotten
about
me
altogether
the
next
morning
he
was
in
deeper
than
ever
margie
came
up
to
him
as
they
were
breaking
camp
come
down
to
the
shore
with
me
she
said
briskly
ah
now
that
s
an
invitation
no
man
in
his
right
mind
would
refuse
you
were
truly
a
major
on
tara
she
asked
bluntly
hmmm
he
tossed
a
clump
of
sand
into
the
surf
i
mean
before
you
were
cashiered
or
were
you
lying
about
that
too
he
had
nothing
against
telling
the
truth
when
he
could
afford
it
a
major
and
he
added
irritably
i
do
nt
care
my
bitchy
friend
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
i
do
not
think
i
want
to
ask
what
a
bitch
is
how
old
are
you
let
me
see
twenty
five
of
our
years
that
makes
about
thirty
of
your
years
that
makes
you
five
of
our
years
older
than
i
am
too
much
older
he
demanded
oh
not
at
all
was
that
a
faint
smile
but
is
nt
that
very
young
for
such
a
rank
customs
are
different
he
said
shortly
but
still
all
right
have
it
your
way
yes
it
was
very
young
the
thought
seemed
to
be
that
i
was
a
very
good
soldier
all
of
which
was
true
enough
but
it
was
poet
he
was
meant
to
be
that
s
beyond
a
doubt
she
nodded
experienced
commander
than
i
am
if
you
rose
to
such
a
rank
so
young
a
much
better
one
i
am
going
to
trust
you
as
you
said
i
have
no
choice
you
must
be
in
charge
and
one
more
thing
major
o
neill
ah
musha
you
ll
find
me
a
very
democratic
co
you
can
call
me
jimmy
tight
lipped
hands
on
her
hips
she
ignored
his
offer
of
friendship
i
am
technically
a
widow
now
even
though
pojoon
was
only
my
intended
mate
i
do
not
have
to
seek
another
i
do
not
intend
to
do
so
for
a
long
time
perhaps
never
i
will
not
accept
any
suggestions
in
that
direction
do
i
make
myself
clear
her
pretty
face
was
hard
her
brown
eyes
stern
what
makes
you
think
i
d
even
be
interested
he
demanded
she
smiled
faintly
again
that
s
right
i
m
a
bitch
i
presume
that
in
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
strode
back
toward
the
ramp
well
as
to
that
it
all
depends
seamus
shouted
after
her
she
did
not
waver
ah
and
the
woman
does
have
a
lovely
ass
on
her
does
nt
she
sure
there
s
a
lot
better
things
to
do
with
it
than
spank
it
the
threat
will
be
enough
he
then
reprimanded
himself
for
having
such
thoughts
about
a
fellow
officer
in
time
of
battle
the
thoughts
did
not
leave
him
however
not
at
all
at
all
giving
him
the
command
changed
her
attitude
later
that
day
she
relaxed
and
smiled
and
by
the
second
day
was
joking
with
the
troops
making
them
laugh
with
him
however
she
was
deadly
serious
that
s
fine
with
me
woman
i
want
no
part
of
the
likes
of
you
wonderful
ass
and
lovely
legs
and
all
i
never
read
in
bed
said
lyra
puzzled
it
was
a
joke
said
patience
at
least
smile
lyra
laughed
too
loudly
but
she
was
obviously
his
white
clothing
showed
his
body
to
be
lithe
and
strong
his
face
could
have
been
the
model
for
a
statue
of
courage
or
manhood
or
virtue
when
he
smiled
he
seemed
to
be
making
love
with
his
eyes
and
lyra
did
nt
miss
any
of
it
except
that
prekeptor
never
took
his
eyes
off
patience
and
now
she
realized
what
a
dangerous
game
the
prince
was
playing
the
heptarch
s
daughter
will
find
that
the
prophecies
of
joy
in
the
testament
will
all
be
fulfilled
in
her
life
said
prekeptor
patience
dutifully
translated
but
also
realized
now
that
the
prince
was
saying
every
word
to
her
the
true
heptarch
s
daughter
with
the
meaning
doubled
the
prophecies
in
the
testament
no
doubt
included
some
of
the
mumbo
jumbo
about
the
seventh
seventh
seventh
daughter
he
was
urging
patience
to
accept
the
prophecies
the
prince
had
still
a
third
gift
it
was
a
plastic
sheath
that
fitted
over
the
glass
rod
within
the
sheath
were
constantly
shifting
flows
of
brightcolored
but
was
fascinating
and
beautiful
prekeptor
handed
it
to
patience
the
heptarch
s
daughter
will
see
that
it
can
be
worn
if
she
chooses
like
a
crown
for
all
the
world
to
see
and
admire
said
the
prince
it
s
like
the
future
you
can
choose
any
color
and
follow
it
wherever
it
goes
if
the
heptarch
s
daughter
chooses
wisely
she
ll
take
a
path
that
leads
to
the
restoration
of
all
that
was
lost
subtly
in
mid
speech
he
had
ceased
using
double
meanings
now
he
was
clearly
speaking
only
to
patience
and
offering
her
a
restoration
to
the
throne
patience
could
not
possibly
translate
prekeptor
s
last
sentence
lyra
would
insist
on
an
explanation
however
patience
could
not
leave
it
out
of
her
translation
either
or
change
its
meaning
because
that
would
alert
oruc
s
listeners
that
she
was
conspiring
with
the
prince
to
conceal
his
treasonous
offer
so
instead
she
stood
silent
what
did
he
say
asked
said
patience
to
prekeptor
she
said
i
m
sorry
my
understanding
of
tassalik
is
so
poor
but
i
can
not
understand
anything
that
is
said
on
this
subject
i
beg
the
prince
to
converse
on
matters
that
this
poor
interpreter
can
comprehend
i
understand
he
answered
smiling
his
hands
were
trembling
i
too
feel
fear
here
in
the
heart
of
heptagon
house
what
you
do
not
know
is
that
all
of
our
party
are
trained
soldiers
and
assassins
they
are
prepared
to
penetrate
to
the
deepest
recesses
of
heptagon
house
to
destroy
your
enemies
anything
patience
answered
could
be
her
death
sentence
in
the
first
place
she
herself
had
been
trained
as
an
assassin
and
she
knew
that
if
prekeptor
s
plan
had
any
chance
of
working
he
had
just
destroyed
it
by
saying
it
out
loud
in
the
open
garden
no
doubt
throughout
heptagon
house
all
the
tassal
embassy
was
now
being
placed
under
irresistible
arrest
with
the
words
of
their
own
prince
he
would
be
listened
to
here
in
the
garden
told
patience
that
prekeptor
was
too
great
a
fool
for
her
to
entrust
her
life
to
him
but
there
was
nothing
she
could
say
to
stop
him
and
clear
herself
if
she
said
i
have
no
enemies
here
in
heptagon
house
she
was
admitting
that
he
was
somehow
correct
to
call
her
the
heptarch
s
daughter
she
had
to
go
on
pretending
that
she
had
no
idea
of
why
he
was
speaking
to
her
and
to
do
that
she
had
to
pretend
not
to
understand
the
plainest
spoken
tassalik
it
was
nt
likely
anyone
would
believe
it
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
believed
it
was
necessary
merely
to
make
it
possible
for
oruc
to
pretend
to
believe
it
as
long
as
they
could
both
pretend
that
she
did
nt
know
she
was
the
rightful
heptarch
s
daughter
she
could
be
allowed
to
live
so
she
put
on
her
most
baffled
expression
and
said
i
m
sorry
i
guess
i
m
out
of
my
depth
i
that
i
do
nt
what
is
he
saying
asked
lyra
she
sounded
concerned
as
well
she
might
be
since
prekeptor
far
from
coming
to
marry
her
had
come
to
kill
her
father
and
no
doubt
her
as
well
i
m
sorry
said
patience
i
understood
almost
nothing
i
thought
you
were
fluent
so
did
i
mother
of
kristos
whispered
prekeptor
mother
of
god
why
do
nt
you
see
the
hand
of
god
in
my
coming
i
am
the
angel
that
stands
at
the
door
and
knocks
i
announce
to
you
god
will
fill
your
womb
his
words
were
frightening
enough
but
the
fervency
with
which
he
said
them
was
terrifying
what
role
did
he
have
in
mind
for
her
in
his
religion
mother
of
god
that
was
the
ancient
virgin
from
earth
and
yet
he
called
her
that
as
if
it
were
her
name
still
she
showed
vaguely
puzzled
look
on
her
face
holy
mother
do
nt
you
see
how
kristos
has
prepared
the
path
for
his
coming
he
took
a
step
toward
her
immediately
she
hardened
her
expression
and
he
stopped
retreated
two
steps
no
matter
what
you
think
god
is
irresistible
he
said
he
has
devoted
seven
times
seven
times
seven
generations
to
create
you
to
be
the
fit
mother
of
the
incarnation
of
kristos
on
the
planet
imakulata
this
is
greater
than
the
number
of
generations
down
to
the
time
of
the
virgin
of
earth
she
let
the
helpless
puzzled
look
return
to
her
face
even
as
she
tried
to
plan
a
course
of
action
in
a
way
this
was
just
like
one
of
angel
s
favorite
games
he
would
give
her
a
complex
mathematical
problem
orally
so
she
had
no
written
guide
to
help
her
concentrate
and
then
immediately
launch
into
a
complex
story
five
minutes
or
ten
minutes
or
insurance
unless
you
inform
the
police
that
s
a
point
fred
ingelnook
said
true
shirley
said
but
it
s
still
minor
in
relation
to
the
public
relations
problem
for
now
we
will
not
report
it
but
we
ll
check
with
insurance
and
hear
from
the
department
chiefs
sounds
good
to
me
fred
ingelnook
said
fine
bob
walthrow
said
the
conversation
wound
down
and
shirley
sent
the
two
executives
home
she
held
jason
her
at
eight
o
clock
that
morning
i
ve
asked
helene
to
come
in
early
maybe
we
can
make
some
sense
out
of
what
s
going
on
jason
nodded
still
wondering
why
shirley
could
nt
have
told
him
all
this
on
the
phone
but
he
was
too
tired
to
care
and
after
giving
her
a
brief
kiss
on
the
cheek
he
staggered
back
out
to
his
car
hoping
for
two
or
three
hours
sleep
pit
was
just
after
eight
that
saturday
morning
when
jason
bleary
eyed
entered
shirley
s
office
it
was
paneled
in
dark
mahogany
with
dark
green
carpet
and
brass
fixtures
and
looked
more
like
it
belonged
to
a
banker
than
to
the
chief
executive
of
a
health
care
plan
shirley
was
on
the
phone
talking
to
an
insurance
adjuster
so
jason
sat
and
waited
after
she
hung
up
she
said
you
were
right
about
the
insurance
they
have
no
intention
of
paying
a
claim
unless
the
break
in
is
reported
then
report
it
first
s
missing
they
crossed
into
the
outpatient
building
and
took
the
elevator
up
to
the
sixth
floor
a
security
guard
was
waiting
for
them
and
unlocked
the
inner
door
they
dispensed
with
the
booties
and
white
coat
like
hayes
s
apartment
the
lab
was
a
mess
all
the
drawers
and
cabinets
had
been
emptied
onto
the
floor
but
the
high
tech
equipment
appeared
untouched
so
it
was
obvious
to
both
of
them
that
it
had
been
a
search
and
not
a
destructive
visit
jason
glanced
into
hayes
s
office
it
was
equally
littered
with
the
contents
of
the
desk
and
several
file
cabinets
strewn
about
the
floor
helene
brennquivist
appeared
in
the
doorway
to
the
animal
room
her
face
white
and
drawn
her
hair
was
again
severely
pulled
back
from
her
face
but
without
her
usual
shapeless
lab
coat
jason
could
see
she
had
an
attractive
figure
can
you
tell
if
anything
is
missing
shirley
asked
well
i
do
nt
see
my
data
books
helene
said
but
the
worst
is
what
s
happened
to
the
animals
what
about
them
jason
asked
noting
that
her
usually
emotionless
face
was
trembling
with
fear
maybe
you
should
look
they
ve
all
been
killed
jason
stepped
around
helene
and
through
the
steel
door
into
the
animal
area
he
was
immediately
confronted
with
a
pungent
zoolike
stench
he
turned
on
the
light
it
was
a
larger
room
some
fifty
feet
long
and
thirty
feet
wide
the
animal
cages
were
organized
in
rows
and
stacked
one
on
top
of
the
other
sometimes
as
many
as
six
high
jason
started
down
the
nearest
row
glancing
into
individual
cages
behind
him
the
door
closed
with
a
decisive
click
helene
had
not
been
exaggerating
all
the
animals
that
jason
saw
were
dead
hideously
curled
in
contorted
positions
often
with
bloodied
tongues
as
if
they
d
chewed
them
in
their
final
agony
suddenly
jason
stopped
short
staring
into
a
group
of
large
cages
he
saw
something
that
made
his
never
seen
they
were
huge
almost
the
size
of
pigs
and
their
bald
whiplike
tails
were
as
thick
as
jason
s
wrists
their
exposed
teeth
were
four
inches
long
moving
along
jason
came
to
rabbits
the
same
size
and
then
white
mice
the
size
of
small
dogs
this
side
of
genetic
engineering
horrified
jason
although
he
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
see
morbid
curiosity
drove
him
on
slowly
he
looked
into
other
cages
seeing
distortions
of
familiar
creatures
that
made
him
sick
it
was
science
gone
mad
rabbits
with
several
heads
and
mice
with
supernumerary
extremities
and
extra
sets
of
eyes
for
jason
genetic
manipulation
of
primitive
bacteria
was
one
thing
distortion
of
mammals
was
quite
another
he
retreated
back
to
the
central
part
of
the
lab
where
shirley
and
helene
had
been
checking
the
scintillation
cultures
have
you
seen
the
animals
jason
asked
shirley
with
disgust
unfortunately
when
curran
was
here
do
nt
remind
me
no
shirley
said
we
never
questioned
hayes
we
never
thought
we
had
to
the
power
of
celebrity
jason
said
cynically
the
animals
were
part
of
dr
hayes
s
growth
hormone
work
helene
said
defensively
whatever
jason
said
he
was
not
interested
in
any
ethical
argumentwith
helene
at
the
moment
at
any
rate
they
re
all
dead
all
of
them
shirley
questioned
how
bizarre
what
do
you
think
happened
poison
jason
said
grimly
though
why
anyone
searching
for
drugs
would
bother
to
kill
lab
animals
beats
me
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
all
of
this
shirley
said
angrily
turning
to
helene
the
younger
woman
shook
her
head
her
eyes
darting
nervously
about
the
room
shirley
continued
to
stare
at
helene
who
was
now
shifting
uncomfortably
from
foot
to
foot
jason
watched
intrigued
by
shirley
s
suddenly
aggressive
behavior
you
or
you
re
going
to
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
dr
howard
is
convinced
you
re
keeping
something
from
us
if
that
s
true
and
we
find
out
i
hope
you
realize
what
that
can
do
to
your
career
helene
s
anxiety
was
finally
apparent
i
just
followed
dr
hayes
s
orders
she
said
her
voice
breaking
what
orders
shirley
asked
lowering
her
voice
threateningly
we
did
some
free
lance
work
here
what
kind
dr
hayes
moonlighted
for
a
company
called
gene
inc
we
developed

for

finally
she
said
i
do
nt
want
you
to
speak
close
enough
not
to
matter
in
this
case
she
had
photographs
of
actual
government
documents
she
placed
the
developed
film
in
a
small
projector
and
focused
the
frame
on
the
white
paint
of
her
bedroom
wall
bisyarina
her
current
assignment
and
knew
a
little
about
how
to
evaluate
what
she
d
just
received
she
was
sure
it
would
make
her
seniors
happy
the
next
morning
she
made
her
drop
and
the
photographs
traveledacross

to

concern
based
in
austin
it
was

by

end
of

day
the
photos
would
be
in
the
soviet
embassy
in

day
after

colonel
what
is
your
assessment
filitov
asked
comrade
bright
star
may
be
the
most
important
program
in
the
soviet
union
bondarenko
said
with
conviction
he
handed
over
forty
handwritten
pages
here
is
the
first
draft
of
my
report
i
did
that
on
the
airplane
i
ll
have
a
proper
copy
typed
today
but
i
thought
that
you
d
you
thought
correctly
i
understand
that
they
ran
a
test
test
and
i
was
allowed
to
inspect
much
of
the
equipment
both
before
and
after
i
was
profoundly
impressed
with
the
installation
and
the
people
who
run
it
if
i
may
be
permitted
general
pokryshkin
is
an
outstanding
officer
and
the
perfect
man
for
that
post
he
is
decidedly
not
a
careerist
but
rather
a
progressive
officer
of
the
finest
type
to
manage
the
academics
on
that
hilltop
is
no
easy
task
misha
grunted
agreement
i
know
about
academicians
are
you
telling
me
he
has
them
organized
like
a
military
unit
no
comrade
colonel
but
pokryshkin
has
learned
how
to
keep
them
relatively
happy
and
productive
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
sense
of
a
sense
of
mission
at
bright
star
that
one
rarely
encounters
even
in
the
officer
corps
i
do
not
say
this
lightly
mikhail
semyonovich
i
was
most
impressed
by
all
aspects
of
the
operation
tom
clancy
perhaps
it
is
the
same
at
the
space
facilities
i
have
heard
such
draw
the
comparison
and
the
systems
themselves
bright
star
is
not
yet
a
weapon
there
are
still
technical
diffi
culties
pokryshkin
identified
and
explained
them
at
length
to
me
for
the
moment
this
is
still
nothing
more
than
an
experimental
program
but
the
most
important
breakthroughs
have
been
made
in
several
years
it
will
be
a
weapon
of
enormous
potential
what
of
its
cost
misha
asked
that
drew
a
shrug
impossible
to
estimate
it
will
be
costly
but
the
expensive
part
of
the
program
the
research
and
development
phase
is
largely
com
pleted
the
actual
production
and
engineering
costs
should
be
less
than
one
might
expect
for
the
weapon
itself
that
is
i
can
not
eval
uate
the
costs
of
the
support
equipment
the
radars
and
surveillance
satellites
that
was
not
part
of
my
brief
in
any
case
besides
like
soldiers
all
over
the
world
he
thought
in
terms
of
mission
not
cost
be
a
problem
but
a
manageable
one
the
individual
lasers
are
complex
and
difficult
to
maintain
on
the
other
hand
by
building
more
than
the
site
actually
needs
we
could
easily
cycle
them
through
a
regular
maintenance
program
and
always
have
the
nec
essary
number
on
line
in
fact
this
is
the
method
proposed
by
the
chief
project
engineer
so
they
ve
solved
the
power
output
problem
then
my
draft
report
describes
that
in
rough
terms
my
final
paper
will
be
more
specific
misha
allowed
himself
a
smile
so
that
even
i
can
understand
it
comrade
colonel
bondarenko
replied
seriously
i
know
that
you
have
a
better
understanding
of
technical
matters
than
you
care
to
admit
the
important
aspects
of
the
power
breakthrough
are
actually
quite
simple
in
theory
that
is
the
precise
engineering
details
are
rather
complex
but
can
easily
be
deduced
from
the
redesign
of
the
lasing
cavity
as
with
the
first
atomic
bomb
once
the
excellent
you
can
finish
your
report
by
tomorrow
yes
comrade
colonel
misha
stood
bondarenko
did
the
same
i
will
read
over
your
preliminary
report
this
afternoon
get
me
the
complete
report
to
morrow
and
i
will
digest
it
over
the
weekend
next
week
we
will
brief
the
minister
allah
s
ways
were
surely
mysterious
the
archer
thought
as
much
as
he
d
wanted
to
kill
a
soviet
transport
aircraft
all
he
had
to
do
was
return
to
his
home
the
river
town
of
ghazni
it
had
been
only
a
week
since
he
d
left
pakistan
a
local
storm
had
grounded
russian
aircraft
for
the
past
several
days
allowing
him
to
make
good
time
he
arrived
with
his
fresh
supplies
of
missiles
and
found
his
chieftain
planning
an
attack
on
the
town
s
outlying
airport
the
winter
weather
was
hard
on
everyone
and
the
infidels
left
the
outer
security
posts
to
afghan
soldiers
in
the
service
of
the
traitorous
government
in
kabul
what
they
commanding
the
battalion
on
perimeter
duty
worked
for
the
local
mudjaheddin
the
perimeter
would
be
open
when
the
time
came
allowing
three
hundred
guerrillas
to
attack
straight
into
the
soviet
camp
it
would
be
a
major
assault
the
freedom
fighters
were
organized
into
three
companies
of
one
hundred
men
each
all
three
were
committed
to
the
attack
the
chieftain
understood
the
utility
of
a
tactical
reserve
but
had
too
much
front
to
cover
with
too
few
men
it
was
a
risk
but
he
and
his
men
had
been
running
risks
since
what
did
one
more
matter
as
usual
the
chieftain
would
be
in
the
place
of
greatest
danger
and
the
archer
would
be
nearby
they
were
heading
for
the
airfield
and
its
hated
aircraft
from
windward
the
soviets
would
try
to
fly
their
craft
off
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble
both
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
and
allow
them
to
provide
defensive
support
the
archer
inspected
four
mi
just
once
they
know
better
than
you
i
ca
nt
believe
that
you
do
nt
understand
i
understand
gideon

thou
sand
dollar

and
you

quit
your
job
against
everyone

advice
i
have
something
to
say
about
this
book
my
blood
is
in
it
too
with
me
and
you
have
nt
got
idea
one
what
a
writer
is
supposed
to
be
take
that
lily
white
banner
and
shove
it
up
your
ass
i
screamed
we

crossroads

i

but
do
nt

oh

i
felt
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
please
honey
i
ca

he
said
i
uh

go
down
to
the
union
next
week
and
see
about
getting
back
on
one
of
the
newspapers
do
nt
do
nt
worry
about
me
i
ve
got
to
walk
it
off
for
a
few
days
i
ll
be
back
i
wish
i
could
explain
what
being
a
writer
means
to
me
gideon
did
nt
have
to
explain
we
d
live
it
out
bloody
battle
by
bloody
battle
he
sent
bascomb
a
telegram
refusing
to
release
the
galleys
left
the
house
and
disappeared
for
three
days
mommy
daddy
s
back
lord
he
looked
like
he
d
been
in
a
flophouse
on
skid
row
i
do
nt
know
how
i
felt
at
like
bitting
him
over
the
head
with
a
chair
union
s
going
to
put
me
on
the
chronicle
he
said
i
ll
be
driving
a
truck
temporarily
no
problem
getting
back
on
just
lose
a
little
senior
ity
you
do
nt
have
to
i
said
the
publisher
has
agreed
to
your
de
mands
martin
reaves
died
before
of
men
in
battle
was
published
the
house
was
ripped
to
pieces
j
bascomb
iii
replaced
publishing
skill
with
cunning
candor
with
deceit
without
a
program
no
one
knew
who
was
talking
to
whom
gideon
really
needed
someone
now
to
guide
him
through
the
coming
months
and
give
him
some
direction
for
his
second
novel
of
men
in
battle
had
built
a
sizable
advance
sale
to
the
booksellers
and
was
to
become
the
first
novel
in
history
to
be
sold
with
a
money
back
guarantee
gideon
had
left
the
newspaper
with
an
understanding
we
would
get
six
hundred
dollars
a
month
from
the
publisher
in
ad
l
could
begin
the
tenderloin
novel
and
we
could
stay
afloat
until
regular
royalty
checks
caught
up
with
us
the
money
failed
to
come
in
even
though
the
book
went
back
for
a
third
printing
before
publication
so
here
was
gideon
with
a
book
about
to
go
onto
the
bestseller
list
and
we
had
to
take
a
second
mortgage
on
the
house
when
a
hollywood
sale
and
screenplay
were
offered
by
pacific
studios
we
grabbed
it
in
order
not
to
sink
i
do
nt
know
the
answer
if
his
publisher
had
kept
his
word
gideon
might
have
passed
up
the
screenplay
job
and
started
the
tenderloin
i
did
nt
know
and
neither
did
he
it
had
become
a
matter
of
survival
and
the
studio
salary
of
seven
hundred
dollars
a
week
seemed
like
the
end
of
the
rainbow
for
me
my
dream
of
tranquillity
was
shattered
forever
i
was
locked
in
with
a
warrior
gideon
san
francisco
bay
area
from
the
time
i
was
a
little
guy
i
rehearsed
the
moments
of
future
glory
a
thousand
and
gideon
zadok
would
be
ready
during
the
dark
years
the
fantasy
of
reaching
the
top
had
become
an
overwhelming
driving
force
that
kept
me
going
now
it
began
to
happen
dream
after
dream
came
true
val
enjoyed
some
of
it
the
tv
shows
the
newspaper
articles
the
good
reviews
the
recognition
and
attention
for
the
first
time
i
saw
a
completely
different
side
of
her
she
was
very
uncomfortable
with
the
spotlight
on
her
she
was
nt
getting
the
kicks
i
was
getting
for
years
when
i
was
working
on
the
newspaper
and
writing
in
the
attic
in
mill
valley
i
would
get
to
a
radio
every
day
and
listen
to
the
mary
margaret
mcbride
show
she
was
a
pleasant
little
fat
lady
who
broadcast
from
her
flat
on
central
park
south
in
new
york
and
interviewed
an
author
a
day
who
was
having
a
new
book
published
when
i
was
summoned
to
her
show
i
was
ready
i
was
ready
for
my
suite
at
the
writer
s
mecca
the
day
but
what
the
hell
i
was
ready
when
i
was
invited
to
lunch
at
their
famed
round
table
graced
by
the
literary
lights
of
the
day
halfway
through
the
meal
i
realized
these
assholes
took
their
one
upmanship
seriously
the
new
yorker
crowd
would
be
oscar
wildes
i
stopped
the
show
with
a
couple
of
blunt
crude
remarks
to
watch
them
gag
and
turn
pale
val
did
nt
catch
the
drift
of
my
humor
at
all
in
fact
she
was
furious
with
me
leon
uris
mitla
pass
i
suppose
you
think
your
vulgar
marine
gutter
talk
was
amusing
oh
for
christ
sake
val
do
nt
you
see
what
a
bunch
of
fakes
they
are
the
whole
goddam
gang
of
them
have
nt
written
anything
for
ten
years
who
in
the
hell
i
ve
given
you
all
this
preliminary
stuff
instead
of
just
dictating
from
the
newsclips
the
photos
when
they
came
made
things
a
little
better
because
their
postures
were
so
versatile
and
graceful
and
their
basically
radial
bodies
were
obviously
in
transition
to
a
bilaterally
symmetrical
form
the
four
back
leg
tentacles
were
much
larger
fact
if
as
happened
later
a
small
one
wore
a
long
robe
with
a
hood
to
conceal
the
shiny
bald
dome
above
the
eye
it
could
pass
for
a
large
somewhat
top
heavy
human
form
and
they
spent
much
of
their
time
thus
upright
looking
rather
like
multiply
armed
indian
deities
and
smelling
delightful
so
that
as
soon
as
earth
saw
more
of
them
the
original
sci
fi
horror
images
were
seen
to
be
ludicrously
inappropriate
and
forgotten
while
todd
and
jim
were
taking
in
the
nature
of
their
audience
and
vice
versa
their
new
friends
were
folding
back
the
walls
of
their
compartments
and
dragging
the
cushions
to
the
edge
of
the
front
we
speak
one
to
all
like
this
we
show
you
and
they
motioned
todd
and
jim
to
take
seats
no
fear
fall
off
everybody
catch
then
they
stationed
themselves
on
each
side
laid
their
transmission
tentacles
across
jim
and
todd
s
shoulders
and
seemed
to
listen
no
clothes
too
thick
so
the
men
first
gingerly
lifted
off
their
helmets
getting
a
real
blast
of
carnation
scent
and
then
started
peeling
down
they
felt
a
bit
odd
about
it
in
front
of
all
those
eager
eyes
but
what
the
hell
their
bodies
were
no
more
to
the
aliens
than
a
wombat
s
to
them
so
they
sat
back
down
again
nude
and
the
tentacles
came
back
ahhh
good
and
with
that
the
two
big
aliens
stretched
their
other
transmitter
arms
out
to
the
aliens
in
the
compartments
next
door
and
these
did
the
same
to
those
around
them
so
that
in
a
minute
the
whole
great
amphitheatre
was
intricately
laced
together
with
the
men
as
foci
while
this
was
happening
todd
felt
a
plucking
at
his
shins
he
looked
down
and
there
was
this
dark
blue
tentacle
coming
up
at
him
from
the
compartment
below
he
heard
or
sensed
what
could
only
be
a
giggle
and
next
instant
three
big
round
bright
eyes
were
staring
up
at
fume
of
interest
wafted
up
the
alien
next
to
him
emitted
a
reproving
sound
and
batted
at
the
eyes
with
a
spare
limb
young
ones
peering
down
todd
and
jim
saw
a
cluster
of
smaller
aliens
in
the
chamber
below
evidently
trying
to
get
in
on
the
network
by
short
circuit
it
s
okay
he
grinned
no
problem
to
us
so
their
two
big
friends
let
the
little
fellows
sneak
tendrils
in
to
touch
the
men
s
legs
and
feet
okay
you
go
first
said
the
one
next
to
jim
oh
wait
us
name
angli
an
gli
it
repeated
aloud
you
name
hello
angli
said
jim
to
them
both
us
name
hu
mans
but
he
pointed
at
the
other
you
have
special
personal
name
for
you
only
well
that
was
their
introduction
to
the
one
great
difficulty
of
mind
speech
asking
questions
it
took
and
even
so
they
were
nt
sure
they
had
it
right
jim
said
the
customary
thing
here
seems
to
be
to
call
up
a
quick
flash
image
of
the
person
or
his
eye
or
something
special
about
him
or
her
i
do
nt
think
verbal
names
are
used
much
but
our
friends
seem
to
be
something
like
urizel
and
azazel
for
what
it
s
worth
we
ll
try
calling
them
that
and
see
if
it
works
then
he
put
his
arm
around
todd
we
together
hu
mans
he
said
but
he
alone
gesturing
is
todd
i
me
here
am
jim
todd
jim
jim
todd
get
it
me
jane
you
tarzan
muttered
todd
shut
up
you
idiot
this
is
no
time
to
clown
we
ll
have
to
be
sure
somehow
that
they
know
what
a
joke
is
all
right
urizel
what
do
you
want
to
know
about
us
humans
first
and
so
started
the
greatest
show
and
tell
anthropology
class
of
their
lives
surprisingly
soon
it
got
itself
organized
with
their
two
friends
alternately
passing
questions
to
the
men
not
surprisingly
in
view
of
their
tv
fare
the
first
queries
were
mainly
about
economics
todd
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
to
answer
what
is
money
he
managed
to
form
a
picture
of
a
medium
of
exchange
passing
from
hand
to
hand
in
the
human
world
and
luckily
the
angli
seemed
to
have
something
to
relate
this
to
jim
got
a
visual
image
of
furry
brown
creatures
carrying
on
their
tails
stacks
of
big
square
things
with
holes
in
them
that
had
to
be
clumsy
coins
gosh
what
does
a
really
rich
one
do
todd
did
nt
expect
an
answer
but
the
angli
had
picked
up
the
drift
of
his
query
and
he
got
a
clear
mental
picture
of
a
pompous
looking
brown
alien
followed
by
a
formal
train
of
specialized
coin
bearers
with
big
discs
both
humans
and
angli
laughed
what
do
you
do
with
money
azazel
asked
jim
gulped
and
tried
to
visualize
a
bank
teller
vaults
checkbooks
i
fear
i
m
not
doing
justice
to
the
international
banking
system
he
said
to
todd
but
dammit
ours
has
to
make
more
sense
than
carrying
your
money
around
on
your
tail
i
m
beginning
to
wonder
todd
muttered
no
no
he
said
to
azazel
not
important
it
was
now
very
apparent
that
the
humans
were
by
no
means
the
first
new
race
the
angli
had
met
fleeting
images
of
many
other
aliens
worlds
cities
ships
crossed
their
perceptions
from
various
angli
minds
these
aliens
seemed
to
have
spent
years
jaunting
about
the
galaxy
meeting
people
and
things
as
to
the
angli
s
own
home
world
the
notion
that
they
were
martians
was
disposed
of
very
early
they
were
shown
an
image
of
a
go
type
sun
a
view
of
the
nearby
constellations
tell
you
too
but
forebore
speaking
for
the
same
reason
joan
quickly
recounted
her
tour
of
the
castle
her
confrontation
with
conroy
and
her
suspicion
that
he
was
up
to
no
good
not
content
to
give
over
her
opinion
that
someone
had
been
concealedpin
the
white
keep
earlier
that
day
she
ventured
to
say
that
it
was
conroy
a
very
sneaky
sort
she
said
but
why
should
he
have
been
lurking
within
matthew
asked
god
knows
she
be
above
him
he
s
full
of
resentment
because
i
ordered
him
from
the
house
to
the
stables
perhaps
he
wanted
to
give
two
silly
women
a
fright
although
he
seems
to
be
friends
with
una
and
she
was
as
unnerved
as
i
if
not
more
so
he
may
be
trying
to
scare
us
off
matthew
suggested
making
capital
of
the
old
stories
about
the
black
keep
perhaps
he
s
heard
about
aileen
mogaill
perhaps
he
killed
her
himself
perhaps
she
found
him
prowling
and
he
took
her
head
for
the
cause
oh
a
goodly
cause
for
homicide
joan
said
but
joan
left
behind
the
irishman
s
behavior
to
proceed
to
greater
news
not
in
the
order
in
which
the
event
occurred
but
in
order
of
its
importance
in
her
mind
she
told
him
what
she
had
seen
in
the
woods
matthew
had
no
trouble
identifying
una
s
hawk
faced
lover
as
stafford
s
manservant
wylkin
there
can
be
no
two
faces
so
alike
give
him
no
satisfaction
beyond
the
assurance
it
was
english
spoken
rather
than
some
other
tongue
of
that
she
was
sure
so
una
understands
english
after
all
matthew
said
shaking
his
head
in
wonderment
that
s
a
new
fact
to
be
reckoned
with
she
made
fools
of
us
joan
said
bitterly
moll
too
for
surely
the
horrid
woman
knew
all
along
it
was
she
who
told
us
una
could
not
speak
what
must
we
have
uttered
in
her
presence
then
matthew
said
shaking
his
head
pinching
his
chin
with
thumb
and
forefinger
but
she
had
already
considered
that
she
was
positive
they
had
not
spoken
of
their
secret
mission
except
in
privacy
as
now
perhaps
the
cook
s
deception
had
failed
of
its
intent
then
at
least
we
ve
been
warned
henceforth
forearmed
against
una
and
moll
said
matthew
but
did
wylkin
see
you
in
the
woods
there
s
the
joan
said
hurt
a
little
at
the
suggestion
she
should
be
so
maladroit
a
spy
a
naked
savage
stealing
on
his
prey
could
not
have
been
more
circumspect
i
crouched
down
low
in
the
ferns
and
thorns
on
my
haunches
wylkin
saw
nothing
and
una
passed
by
unawares
and
singing
upon
her
return
to
the
house
i
waited
then
until
i
was
sure
both
were
gone
completely
thank
god
matthew
said
had
wylkin
seen
you
crouched
there
who
knows
what
he
would
have
done
edward
speaks
very
ill
of
him
then
she
told
him
about
her
visit
to
the
lake
she
had
saved
this
for
last
for
she
regarded
both
her
glimmering
and
the
chest
that
had
provoked
it
the
first
of
their
clues
to
sir
john
s
drowning
matthew
listened
to
her
story
without
interrupting
when
she
had
finished
he
put
a
sympathetic
hand
on
her
hand
and
said
a
terrible
vision
indeed
then
he
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
its
quality
and
all
the
details
of
its
construction
that
joan
had
only
half
noticed
what
she
exclaimed
in
exasperation
am
i
a
carpenter
that
i
should
observe
these
things
it
was
a
chest
a
plain
wooden
chest
such
as
might
store
clothing
well
it
might
be
a
clue
matthew
conceded
but
she
protested
his
weaseling
might
be
of
course
it
s
a
clue
anyone
can
see
that
in
the
first
place
it
was
no
chest
for
casual
discarding
who
but
a
fool
would
throw
away
a
chest
so
fine
in
the
second
it
was
not
hidden
where
i
found
it
but
half
submerged
an
incompetent
concealment
if
there
ever
was
one
i
ll
wager
it
floated
ashore
and
foundered
like
a
vessel
at
low
tide
only
it
was
deep
in
the
sedge
very
deep
seeing
it
was
a
stroke
of
luck
but
oh
matthew
such
a
midnight
melancholy
seized
me
when
i
touched
the
thing
and
a
vision
all
about
me
and
loathsome
creatures
gaping
and
sucking
she
shuddered
at
the
recollection
and
seeing
how
distressed
she
was
matthew
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
and
drew
her
forehead
against
his
cheek
her
skin
was
cool
he
could
feel
her
trembling
he
asked
her
what
she
thought
her
vision
meant
and
she
shook
her
head
puzzled
she
was
almost
afraid
to
speculate
but
she
saidpshe
was
sure
the
chest
meant
something
was
connected
to
the
baronet
s
death
and
perhaps
with
aileen
mogaill
s
too
her
certainty
seemed
to
settle
the
matter
and
matthew
admitted
the
empty
chest
into
his
inventory
of
clues
as
small
an
inventory
as
it
was
he
had
too
much
respect
for
his
wife
s
intuitions
and
visions
to
contest
her
interpretation
partly
to
distract
her
from
her
gloomy
memories
he
told
her
about
his
visit
to
the
wretched
tenant
farms
about
his
meeting
with
stafford
and
wylkin
repeating
all
that
was
on
either
side
as
best
he
could
recall
it
he
told
at
the
bastian
cottage
and
about
the
fire
that
had
been
laid
shortly
before
his
arrival
but
not
by
the
old
man
who
matthew
was
convinced
would
have
been
incapable
of
it
joan
agreed
it
was
very
suspicious
a
child
in
the
cottage
whose
existence
edward
denies
could
it
have
been
a
mewing
cat
you
heard
or
a
squealing
pig
the
bastians
keep
no
pigs
and
i
saw
no
cat
he
said
at
the
same
time
thinking
that
one
often
saw
no
cat
yet
there
might
have
been
one
yet
he
insisted
he
knew
what
he
had
heard
the
wail
of
a
human
child
a
singular
isolated
note
he
could
have
discerned
in
the
mighty
cacophony
of
a
tempest
from
the
slime
and
blood
managed
to
get
the
body
over
his
shoulder
his
knees
began
topbuckle
but
not
now
you
fucking
knees
not
when
i
fucking
need
you
the
blood
and
rain
were
blinding
him
and
he
worked
by
the
sense
of
touch
he
closed
the
trunk
and
there
was
a
moment
of
panic
when
he
thought
maybe
he
d
locked
the
car
keys
in
the
trunk
he
fumbled
around
in
his
pockets
balancing
the
dead
man
on
his
shoulders
while
he
checked
it
out
the
relief
when
he
found
the
keys
almost
made
him
drop
the
body
then
he
began
the
climb
up
onto
the
trunk
slowly
so
you
do
nt
drop
the
bastard
carefully
so
you
do
nt
slip
make
sure
of
the
grip
like
you
re
on
the
icy
lip
of
some
crevice
of
the
matterhorn
ah
god
god
god
he
could
feel
the
body
sliding
away
again
the
momentum
was
irresistible
he
felt
like
crying
when
the
body
slithered
off
under
the
buick
he
could
hear
the
head
crack
against
the
pavement
it
made
him
cringe
it
did
nt
did
maybe
it
was
worse
there
was
something
profane
about
injuring
a
dead
man
fuck
fuck
fuck
he
thought
of
stopping
just
giving
up
he
was
innocent
of
wrongdoing
he
could
just
accept
the
incriminating
accusations
admit
the
moment
of
temptation
and
get
it
all
out
in
the
open
but
he
could
nt
surrender
a
lifelong
habit
of
rectitude
he
could
nt
admit
the
foolish
impulse
that
had
brought
him
here
in
the
first
place
no
despite
the
pain
in
his
chest
jack
began
again
heaving
and
cursing
and
swearing
in
the
cold
rain
he
summoned
reserves
of
strength
that
he
did
nt
know
he
had
and
began
the
maneuvering
and
lifting
first
up
against
the
car
then
bending
under
the
bulk
like
a
fireman
letting
his
legs
do
the
lifting
he
was
learning
he
made
no
mistakes
working
carefully
systematically
he
got
himself
and
the
body
up
to
the
rim
of
the
dumpster
at
last
using
his
head
to
bull
it
that
final
inch
on
that
high
perch
with
his
burden
in
his
arms
he
looked
up
and
found
himself
staring
smack
into
the
face
of
the
dead
man
i
ll
have
nightmares
from
this
he
told
the
dead
man
if
it
s
any
comfort
i
ll
probably
never
sleep
peacefully
again
as
he
tried
to
catch
his
breath
he
tried
to
imagine
how
the
sight
of
him
and
his
dead
body
would
strike
the
cops
in
a
passing
sector
car
a
station
house
legend
would
be
born
then
then
you
re
not
gon
na
believe
this
it
turns
out
to
be
an
ex
fucking
cop
trying
to
lose
a
stiff
jack
mann
might
become
a
locker
room
immortal
having
recovered
a
little
jack
noticed
that
the
lid
of
the
dumpster
was
closed
schmuck
why
did
nt
you
leave
it
open
he
turned
to
open
it
and
twisted
his
back
i
ll
feel
that
later
too
he
told
himself
then
he
rolled
the
corpse
into
the
hole
as
the
body
sank
into
its
grave
god
forgive
me
he
mumbled
then
he
reached
over
and
piled
debris
over
the
dead
man
he
did
nt
want
anyone
peeking
in
and
finding
it
tomorrow
with
any
luck
the
corpse
would
be
gone
forever
trucked
out
to
some
rockaway
landfill
along
with
all
the
other
nameless
mob
victims
buried
in
that
unmarked
cemetery
his
work
was
finished
and
he
climbed
down
and
stood
on
the
asphalt
he
was
winded
and
wheezing
his
muscles
were
singing
from
the
exertion
he
stood
for
a
moment
dazed
by
what
he
had
done
then
he
fished
out
the
car
keys
opened
the
trunk
and
found
a
towel
and
wiped
away
the
blood
he
turned
his
face
upward
and
blessed
the
rain
as
he
struggled
back
into
his
shirt
and
jacket
he
looked
at
the
bag
full
of
money
the
plan
had
been
to
toss
the
money
and
the
gun
into
the
dumpster
along
with
the
body
one
convenient
burial
it
would
be
as
maybe
he
should
get
rid
of
the
money
and
the
gun
someplace
else
he
needed
time
he
stuffed
the
bag
full
of
cash
deeper
into
the
trunk
covered
it
with
his
own
debris
climbed
into
the
driver
s
seat
and
headed
home
he
was
too
tired
and
it
was
nt
only
rain
running
down
his
cheeks
there
were
also
tears
she
was
cold
and
wet
although
it
was
nt
the
winter
weather
that
made
her
shiver
waiting
for
the
bus
on
the
little
spit
of
land
between
the
airport
and
the
mainland
of
queens
it
was
much
worse
on
an
inclement
night
in
belfast
what
nora
felt
through
her
coat
was
the
raw
wind
of
michael
back
in
her
life
this
is
america
she
told
herself
i
do
nt
have
to
be
stuck
with
my
old
sad
story
when
the
bus
finally
pulled
up
to
the
shelter
outside
of
the
she
been
on
cross
bay
boulevard
the
faces
of
the
other
two
passengers
did
nt
help
nora
s
morale
the
first
was
a
middle
aged
woman
a
rosary
she
had
the
look
of
permanent
fear
stitched
in
her
face
and
stared
fiercely
out
of
the
window
a
charwoman
thought
nora
from
the
look
of
her
gnarled
hands
and
wild
hairpand
haggard
face
you
saw
them
like
that
in
ireland
nora
thought
young
hags
on
their
way
to
becoming
old
hags
halfway
up
the
aisle
was
a
man
in
rough
work
clothes
he
bobbed
like
a
puppet
with
the
movement
of
the
bus
there
were
specks
of
vomit
on
his
beard
nora
could
guess
his
story
out
drinking
after
a
day
s
work
and
coming
home
surly
and
mean
to
his
wife
from
high
school
and
a
batch
of
neglected
kids
then
she
saw
herself
in
the
reflection
of
the
bus
window
her
wet
hair
flat
against
her
head
we
look
like
outpatients
from
an
asylum
nora
thought
glancing
at
the
pale
laborer
and
the
the
middle
of
the
advancing
wave
by
the
task
of
stripping
the
offensive
armor
off
the
old
man
foil
and
skin
ripped
red
seeping
from
broad
patches
of
raw
skin
axxter
felt
bad
about
that
it
was
nt
the
old
man
s
fault
much
less
so
than
his
own
the
old
guy
had
been
a
pawn
used
to
spear
another
pawn
he
d
wind
up
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
the
mass
hospital
getting
new
armor
grafted
on
not
that
there
would
be
any
remedy
for
his
senile
broken
heart
real
time
he
toppled
back
in
his
chair
as
the
edge
of
the
table
slammed
into
his
stomach
the
table
itself
rose
turning
on
its
long
axis
as
the
front
of
the
mob
surged
against
it
axxter
knocked
breathless
looked
up
in
time
to
see
the
table
come
crashing
down
on
him
or
almost
the
top
edge
caught
against
the
tent
fabric
behind
him
forming
a
triangular
space
with
the
platform
underneath
axxter
uncurled
from
his
knees
drawn
up
egg
unlacing
his
fingers
from
the
top
of
his
head
he
could
hear
the
outraged
havoc
mass
warriors
foaming
and
scrabbling
at
the
underside
of
the
table
as
though
their
black
fingernails
could
scrape
right
through
to
him
jesus
christ
fucking
shit
the
lofty
time
dilated
perspective
snapped
away
from
him
on
hands
and
knees
he
listened
to
the
shouts
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
capsized
table
the
sonsabitches
were
going
to
kill
him
if
i
m
lucky
once
they
got
their
hands
on
him
they
had
all
sorts
of
ingenious
ways
to
flesh
and
nervous
system
and
that
prickly
emotion
had
been
revved
flat
out
inside
their
breasts
being
made
mock
of
like
that
in
front
of
the
ambassadors
and
hangers
on
from
all
their
allied
tribes
p
and
by
some
little
outside
freelancer
punk
like
him
they
all
had
major
payback
to
deal
out
the
table
shivered
with
the
blows
raining
against
it
the
angle
between
it
the
platform
and
the
tent
wall
formed
a
narrow
tunnel
none
of
the
crazed
mob
had
thought
yet
of
going
around
to
either
end
crawling
in
and
pulling
him
out
there
were
probably
only
a
few
more
seconds
before
the
crowd
backed
up
enough
to
let
the
table
be
pulled
away
exposing
him
one
chance
the
thought
of
all
those
whirling
through
axxter
s
head
stood
out
of
saving
his
life
or
at
least
enough
little
spark
of
it
to
get
through
the
beating
plus
that
was
going
to
come
crashing
down
on
him
if
he
could
scoot
down
the
triangular
tunnel
pop
out
make
a
dash
up
to
the
dignitaries
table
get
there
before
any
of
the
mob
spotted
him
and
collared
him
with
a
hairy
forearm
around
his
neck
throw
his
arms
around
general
cripplemaker
s
knees
then
he
could
make
a
chattel
declaration
to
the
tribe
and
then
he
d
be
under
their
protection
or
at
least
a
little
bit
enough
they
could
nt
kill
him
by
the
usual
rules
though
he
knew
they
d
come
as
close
as
they
could
the
plan
and
the
consequences
of
becoming
an
owned
thing
no
longer
human
an
object
zipped
through
his
mind
without
words
he
looked
down
the
tunnel
he
had
a
clear
shot
to
the
dais
everyone
on
the
floor
seemed
to
have
come
around
to
join
in
the
assault
on
the
overturned
table
what
looked
like
the
bottom
half
of
cripplemaker
s
dress
uniform
shining
black
trouser
legs
striped
with
red
appeared
in
the
distance
a
chair
knocked
over
behind
the
standing
figure
go
he
started
broken
glass
just
go
for
christ

sake
p
uhff

muffled
sound
of
blows
came
through
the
table

finally
taking
charge
come
on

back
goddam
mit
axxter
froze
staring
down
to
the
triangular
opening
ahead
of
him
and
beyond
he
did
nt
see
the
chaos
of
tables
and
chairs
and
the
general
s
legs
something
else
like
looking
down
the
wall
at
night
into
dark
without
bottom
get
back
get
back
come
on
come
on
move
it
the
commanding
voice
barked
and
the
table
creaked
in
response
relieved
of
the
weight
pressed
against
it
the
narrow
tunnel
lengthened
and
spiraled
as
axxter
gazed
down
into
its
depths
fingers
appeared
around
the
edge
of
the
table
ya
got
it
no
over
there
come
on
get
outta
the
way
okay
pull
the
table
crashed
over
its
climbed
on
top
of
a
chair
on
the
dais
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
operations
the
little
graffex
bastard
was
going
to
pay
he
d
make
sure
of
that
for
making
a
fool
out
of
him
well
the
general
shouted
down
to
the
men
swarming
over
the
table
you
got
him
the
sergeant
who
d
been
directing
the
operation
pulled
a
pair
of
men
back
by
their
shoulders
down
the
length
of
the
upside
down
table
the
rest
stood
back
where
is
he
the
sergeant
looked
to
either
side
and
got
shrugs
and
upraised
palms
in
reply
where
d
he
go
a
couple
of
the
havoc
mass
warriors
pried
the
edge
of
the
table
up
from
the
platform
as
though
the
graffex
might
have
been
squashed
flat
underneath
the
baffled
sergeant
looked
up
at
the
general
axxter
could
hear
them
swearing
and
stomping
around
through
the
platform
he
swayed
in
open
air
the
p
big
step
down
grip
on
the
ropes
slung
beneath
the
ceremonial
tent
he
d
have
to
move
fast
now
or
his
one
slick
move
would
have
been
in
vain
a
glance
down
to
the
cloud
barrier
far
below
brought
his
stomach
up
in
his
throat
he
gripped
the
rope
tighter
his
ankles
locked
around
its
length
farther
along
and
started
inching
himself
toward
the
wall
in
the
expanded
seconds
just
before
the
mass
warriors
had
pulled
the
table
back
over
he
d
had
a
vision
a
peek
down
the
line
into
the
future
his
future
after
he
d
made
his
chattel
declaration
pass
about
ten
minutes
later
they
reached
the
clay
mounds
and
the
square
wells
with
their
terrible
contents
they
drove
through
thick
loose
mud
for
a
long
time
then
came
to
the
tracks
that
their
own
tires
had
made
going
the
other
way
and
followed
them
back
to
the
valley
throwing
up
fountains
of
mud
from
beneath
its
wheels
the
jeep
picked
its
way
between
the
clay
mounds
a
blurred
light
flared
up
in
the
darkness
and
came
toward
them
growing
larger
until
they
could
distinguish
three
separate
lights
but
the
captain
maintained
speed
knowing
it
was
a
reflection
the
doubler
began
to
show
signs
of
uneasiness
it
moved
it
grunted
it
even
shifted
its
weight
dangerously
making
the
jeep
tilt
more
to
the
left
the
doctor
tried
to
calm
the
creature
with
his
voice
though
without
much
success
glancing
back
he
saw
that
it
now
resembled
a
rounded
sugarloaf
on
top
the
doubler
had
pulled
in
its
small
torso
and
when
the
momentary
ripple
of
heat
and
the
disappearance
of
their
reflection
announced
that
they
had
crossed
the
mysterious
line
that
the
huge
passenger
relaxed
stopped
fidgeting
and
even
seemed
to
enjoy
the
night
ride
the
jeep
was
now
climbing
a
steep
slope
it
pitched
and
reeled
as
its
bulging
tires
lumbered
over
large
rocks
the
engine
straining
whined
once
or
twice
they
began
rolling
backward
the
wheels
spinning
in
a
spray
of
loose
soil
the
captain
turned
the
steering
wheel
sharply
and
they
stopped
cautiously
he
turned
the
jeep
around
and
they
went
back
down
the
slope
along
a
diagonal
into
the
valley
where
are
we
going
asked
the
chemist
nervously
gusts
of
night
air
carried
tiny
droplets
of
water
almost
like
rain
we
ll
try
somewhere
else
said
the
captain
they
halted
and
looked
uphill
using
one
of
the
headlights
but
there
was
not
much
to
see
so
they
tried
again
at
random
the
slope
soon
became
the
ground
was
dry
and
the
jeep
could
proceed
every
time
the
captain
steered
to
keep
to
compass
north
however
the
jeep
fell
back
on
its
rear
tires
forcing
him
westward
which
meant
that
they
would
run
into
the
thicket
as
far
as
he
could
remember
the
thicket
covered
most
of
the
edge
of
the
plateau
toward
which
they
were
climbing
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
headlights
struck
a
row
of
white
figures
swaying
in
the
gloom
no
it
was
only
mist
drops
of
condensation
formed
and
ran
down
the
windshield
and
the
metal
tubing
of
the
seat
frames
the
cold
mist
thickened
then
thinned
and
they
had
no
idea
where
they
were
going
the
captain
tried
only
to
go
uphill
suddenly
the
mist
dispersed
and
the
headlights
now
bright
revealed
the
top
of
the
slope
the
black
sky
above
was
filled
with
stars
everyone
began
to
feel
better
how
s
our
passenger
asked
the
captain
not
turning
around
said
the
doctor
the
slope
became
steeper
and
the
jeep
s
center
of
gravity
shifting
to
the
rear
made
it
impossible
to
steer
with
the
front
wheels
they
skidded
several
feet
to
the
side
then
the
doctor
suggested
maybe
i
should
sit
up
front
between
the
headlights
on
the
bumper
not
yet
the
captain
said
he
released
air
from
the
tires
and
the
jeep
sinking
held
the
ground
better
they
crossed
a
large
loamy
area
and
the
ragged
line
of
scrub
above
them
came
closer
and
closer
like
an
over
hanging
black
brush
going
through
it
was
out
of
the
question
but
they
could
nt
turn
to
look
for
a
better
place
to
enter
so
they
continued
upward
and
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
about
forty
feet
from
a
wall
six
feet
high
the
headlights
showed
yellow
clay
filled
with
threadlike
roots
the
chemist
cursed
the
captain
got
out
took
a
shovel
and
dug
at
the
clay
digging
he
moved
higher
the
chemist
hurried
after
him
the
doctor
could
hear
them
working
their
way
into
the
thicket
could
hear
the
snap
and
crackle
of
dry
branches
the
captain
s
flashlight
flickered
went
out
went
on
again
in
another
place
what
awful
stuff
growled
the
chemist
this
is
risky
we
are
hardly
strangers
to
risk
responded
the
captain
raising
his
voice
he
called
to
the
doctor
we
re
going
to
start
a
little
landslide
it
should
clear
a
path
for
us
try
to
keep
our
passenger
from
getting
frightened
all
right
the
doctor
shouted
back
he
turned
around
in
his
seat
to
face
the
doubler
who
was
curled
up
and
still
then
came
the
sound
of
moving
clay
and
a
stream
of
clods
rolled
down
the
slope
lumps
thudded
against
the
jeep
the
landslide
stopped
though
bits
of
soil
kept
trickling
from
the
wall
the
doctor
checked
the
creature
it
was
now
a
wide
funnel
shaped
breach
in
the
overhanging
lip
of
clay
the
captain
was
standing
in
it
working
energetically
with
his
shovel
it
was
past
twelve
by
the
time
they
took
the
towline
the
reel
and
the
grappling
hook
from
the
luggage
carrier
fastened
one
end
of
the
line
to
the
jeep
and
pulled
the
other
through
the
breach
and
up
into
the
thicket
where
it
was
anchored
the
doctor
and
the
chemist
got
out
and
the
captain
turned
on
all
the
wheel
motors
and
the
front
winch
which
drew
the
vehicle
forward
bit
by
bit
further
widening
of
the
passage
was
required
but
half
an
hour
later
the
jeep
was
on
the
plateau
plowing
noisily
through
the
dry
and
brittle
thicket
for
another
hour
their
progress
was
very
slow
only
when
the
vegetation
came
to
an
end
were
they
able
to
pick
up
speed
halfway
the
chemist
shouted
to
the
doctor
after
looking
over
the
captain
s
shoulder
at
the
odometer
the
captain
did
nt
think
been
forced
to
take
on
the
slope
he
was
bent
forward
his
face
close
to
the
windshield
his
eyes
on
the
terrain
he
was
trying
to
avoid
the
larger
boulders
and
ruts
and
take
the
smaller
ones
between
the
wheels
