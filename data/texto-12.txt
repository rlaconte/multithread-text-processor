for
his
speech
what
was
this
singular
lightening
of
the
heart
which
matey
felt
as
she
ran
down
the
stairs
she
felt
like
capering
it
was
absurd
she
felt
exactly
she
thought
with
no
reason
at
all
as
though
she
had
had
very
good
news
when
she
had
been
expectingbad
she
laughed
at
almost
everything
at
the
fatness
of
mimi
s
new
baby
at
the
way
they
avoided
the
stuffy
french
ceremoniousness
of
mimi
s
overdraped
bourgeois
salon
and
all
piled
into
the
kitchen
sunlit
and
copper
saucepan
decorated
where
the
picnic
baskets
were
being
filled
at
the
frantic
objections
of
that
absurd
lovable
ziza
to
any
plan
of
march
to
the
river
which
would
separate
her
from
her
husband
she
noticed
that
mimi
looked
at
her
curiously
as
to
dance
savezvousplanter
les
choux
with
him
and
later
on
she
caught
the
same
look
of
inquiry
from
mme
vinet
as
picnic
baskets
in
hand
the
comfortable
family
party
strolled
along
the
country
lane
that
led
from
mimi
s
house
to
the
banks
of
the
marne
it
is
such
a
lovely
lovely
autumn
day
thought
matey
this
friendly
autumn
sun
was
enough
to
make
a
paralytic
leap
and
run
and
how
deep
hearted
these
civilized
french
people
were
how
warm
the
family
feeling
which
kept
them
all
together
how
nice
it
was
to
be
with
them
again
she
began
to
sing
at
the
top
of
her
voice
m
le
cure
n
a
pas
deux
souta
a
nes
a
light
minded
marching
song
henri
had
brought
back
from
his
military
service
leading
the
others
she
kept
it
going
through
all
of
its
interminable
variations
as
they
finished
the
song
mimi
called
out
to
adrian
you
have
brought
back
our
old
mete
to
us
how
so
inquired
adrian
she
how
she
did
upset
all
our
rules
the
year
she
stayed
with
us
never
cried
matey
astonished
i
was
crushed
submissive
as
a
little
mouse
i
obeyed
more
rules
than
i
had
thought
i
could
they
interrupted
her
with
derisive
laughter
even
henri
we
always
called
that
year
our
trip
to
america
he
told
her
adrian
shook
his
head
over
a
disillusionment
all
those
stories
of
matey
s
about
how
suppressed
she
was
they
drifted
apart
in
a
narrow
place
in
the
lane
henri
and
adrian
walking
together
well
she
has
been
suppressed
since
then
said
henri
i
have
not
seen
her
like
this
not
since
she
was
grown
up
he
added
pleasantly
the
obvious
it
speaks
well
for
her
husband
for
an
instant
adrian
did
not
hear
him
he
had
been
as
mystified
by
matey
s
high
spirits
as
the
vinets
as
matey
herself
he
ever
had
with
him
this
was
the
light
heartedness
into
which
he
had
so
longed
to
open
the
door
for
her
he
had
seen
one
glimpse
of
it
the
night
of
francis
visit
the
evening
when
they
had
decided
not
to
put
their
wedding
off
till
june
he
had
tried
tried
with
all
his
love
his
tenderness
his
passion
to
free
her
for
it
again
but
he
had
been
in
the
dark
he
had
not
known
where
to
throw
his
effort
what
was
it
that
kept
her
hesitating
sent
her
in
the
midst
of
cheerfulness
into
those
inexplicable
numb
fits
made
her
unable
to
step
off
freely
into
gayety
as
she
was
doing
today
henri
s
remark
finally
penetrated
to
his
attention
i
m
afraid
it
ca
nt
be
laid
to
her
husband
he
answered
trying
to
speak
lightly
it
s
rather
improbable
that
the
best
of
husbands
should
affect
her
all
at
once
today
like
this
he
returned
with
the
equally
obvious
it
s
probably
but
to
himself
he
thought
eagerly
wistfully
could
it
be
she
s
just
waking
up
to
our
being
together
for
always
and
liking
it
i
ll
ask
her
why
not
how
is
it
mete
mme
vinet
was
saying
as
she
walked
beside
matey
that
thy
husband
knows
our
marching
songs
and
the
commands
of
our
army
he
spent
a
year
and
a
half
in
paris
studying
painting
explained
matey
i
thought
you
said
he
is
in
a
bank
so
he
is
she
hesitated
decided
that
the
plainest
possible
statement
was
the
best
and
explained
he
thought
he
had
not
enough
talent
to
give
himself
to
painting
mme
vinet
needed
no
embellishments
on
this
statement
ah
she
murmured
not
an
ordinary
young
man
she
looked
ahead
to
where
adrian
was
carrying
mimi
s
delighted
four
year
old
the
sound
of
his
laughter
and
the
delicious
said
seriously
to
matey
as
she
would
to
a
daughter
mete
i
think
thou
hast
a
good
husband
thou
must
be
a
good
wife
to
him
matey
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
it
was
very
different
from
any
of
the
comments
spoken
or
unspoken
she
had
received
on
her
marriage
from
her
american
circle
no
one
had
ever
put
it
to
her
from
that
side
thou
must
learn
how
to
make
up
to
him
for
what
he
has
put
away
said
mme
vinet
earnestly
as
though
matey
were
still
a
little
girl
under
her
care
but
it
was
ziza
little
mad
inflammatory
ziza
who
challenged
matey
most
directly
after
the
lunch
stuffed
and
somnolent
theyplay
about
the
river
bank
smoking
and
making
their
digestions
the
two
adrians
with
leisurely
gestures
were
bailing
out
a
waterlogged
boat
preparatory
to
taking
their
brides
for
a
row
on
the
river
matey
and
ziza
sat
together
their
backs
against
a
great
sycamore
looking
down
on
mete
cherie
ziza
asked
pouncingly
are
you
making
your
husband
happy
well
i
hope
so
said
matey
heartily
she
thought
ziza
replied
no
you
re
not
not
what
i
call
happy
or
you
could
nt
answer
in
that
voice
you
are
not
happy
as
i
i
am
crazy
crazy
crazy
about
my
husband
each
impassioned
folle

burst
up
from
her
like
a
ball
from
a
roman
candle
you
re
not
over
money
fast
enough
so
he
was
glad
to

the

their
whiskyscalded
carcases
to
rot
in
the

on
another
load
he
shipped
down
fifteen
hundred
they
all
died
to
prove
in
the
hole
the
railroad
had
nothing
to

keith
made
them
plant
bananas
so
that
the
railroad
might
have
something
to
haul
to
market
the
bananas
he
had
to
go
into

be
a
streetcar

they

been
a
streetcar
conductor
in
albany
and
drank
and
was
seen
and
he
went
over
to
lawrence

his
roommate
and
they
reported
in

and
people
yelled
at
them
blacklegs
scabs

nt
wops

muckers
a
low
element
they
liked
each
other
a
lot
this
fellow
did
and
his
roommate
and
he
got
up
on
the
platform
and
twirled
the
bright
brass
handle
and
clanged
the
bell
it
was
in
the
carbarn
his
roommate
was
fiddling
with
something
between
the
bumpers
and
this
fellow
twirled
the
shiny
brass
handle
and
the
car
started
and
he
ran
down
his
roommate
and
his
head
was
mashed
just
like
that
between
the
bumpers
killed
him
dead
just
like
that
right
there
in
the
carbarn
and
now
the
fellow

among

he
lived
in
a
big
red
frame
house
a
mrs
cook
a
crotchety
old
woman
from
belfast
who
had
been
forced
to
take
lodgers
since
her
husband
who
had
been
a
foreman
in
one
of
the
homestead
mills
had
been
crushed
by
a
crane
dropping
a
load
of
pigiron
over
him
she
made
ward
his
breakfasts
and
his
sunday
dinners
and
stood
over
him
while
he
was
eating
them
alone
in
the
stuffy
furniture
crowded
diningroom
telling
him
about
her
youth
in
the
north
of
ireland
and
the
treachery
of
papists
and
the
virtues
of
the
defunct
mr
cook
it
was
a
bad
time
for
ward
he
had
no
friends
in
pittsburgh
and
he
had
colds
and
sore
throats
all
through
the
cold
grimy
sleety
winter
he
hated
the
newspaper
office
and
the
inclines
and
the
overcast
skies
and
the
breakneck
wooden
stairs
he
was
always
scrambling
up
and
down
and
the
smell
of
poverty
and
cabbage
and
children
and
washing
in
the
rattletrap
tenements
where
he
was
always
seeking
out
mrs
piretti
whose
husband
had
been
killed
in
a
rumpus
in
a
saloon
on
locust
street
or
sam
burkovich
who
d
been
elected
with
sudsy
hands
whose
child
had
been
slashed
by
a
degenerate
he
never
got
home
to
the
house
before
three
or
four
in
the
morning
and
by
the
time
he
had
breakfasted
round
noon
there
never
seemed
to
be
any
time
to
do
anything
before
he
had
to
call
up
the
office
for
assignments
again
when
he
had
first
gotten
to
pittsburgh
he
had
called
to
see
mr
mcgill
whom
he
d
met
with
jarvis
oppenheimer
in
paris
mr
mcgill
remembered
him
and
took
down
his
address
and
told
him
to
keep
in
touch
because
he
hoped
to
find
an
opening
for
him
in
the
new
information
bureau
that
was
being
organized
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
but
the
weeks
went
by
and
he
got
no
word
from
mr
mcgill
he
got
an
occasional
dry
note
from
annabelle
marie
about
legal
technicalities
she
would
divorce
him
charging
nonsupport
desertion
and
cruelty
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
refuse
to
and
two
and
two
there
is
no
difference
between
younger
and
older
between
told
and
told
her
between
him
and
between
him
there
is
no
difference
hurriedly
when
this
is
said
said
said
said
very
well
up
there
so
yes
very
well
up
there
this
is
the
way
of
it
as
they
as
they
this
is
the
way
of
said
and
say
they
are
rich
and
richer
every
day
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
to
be
seen
tell
well
that
it
is
to
be
seen
that
every

this
makes
the
formation
of
the
clouds
very
much
as
much
as
if
they
were
there
in
inches
beside
this
if
the
desire
to

on
in

day
makes
it
as

never
to
say
so
in

behalf
there
is
no
inexactitude
in

and
richer
how
can
it
be

a

which

has
to
be

it
by

an
advantage
that

planted

and
practically
by

best
way
of
passing
within
an
appreciable
distance
it
nobody
can
know

he

very
willing
to
be
serviceable
in

and
out
out
and
out
and
going

without

father

son
it
is
currently
expected
that
very
many
follow
with
another
in
this
and
sweetly
having
been
very
likely
that
the
bell
rang
they
marry
if
she
made
it
easy
to
read
the

contract
a

to
marry
if

who
could
call

false
cock
false
cock
and
no
answer
and
by
the
best
of
embroidery
which
is
white
with
a
delicate
touch
and
so
they
marry
marry
marry
three
when
this
you
see
you
can
marry
me
when
this
you
see
you
can
marry
me
marry
marry
undeniably
marry
and
see
see
that
orchids
are
brown
and
withal
withal
withal
intent
it
is
undeniably
an
undeniably
undertaken
intentionally
when
this
marriage
with
coming
to
be
to
be
hit
egrally
undeniably
having
settled
that
every
one
is
rich
and
richer
how
many
have
they

it
to
begin
to

torn
away
from

result
of
a
courageous
boy
with
a

a
boy
being
a

very

observation

so
much
so
that

there
would
be

a

a

that

that

so

mistakenly
if
everybody
is

when
are
mountains
covered
with

we
know
some
say
that
everything

this
does
change
daughters

bonnat
was
killed
not
by
the
regular
attackers
but
by
the
aid
of
a
boy
who
was
a
young
man
and
pushed
a
cart
as
a
cover
conversation
about
character
pit
is
very
rare
to
see
three
brothers
working
together
and
if
there
is
an
exodus
there
will
not
be
more
than
old
and
young
and
young
and
old
and
in
between
when
medallions
of
letting
it
alone
are
strung
in
this
way
they
are
different
in
their
turn
to
apples
grapes
cakes
and
further
destruction
of
three
trees
which
are
valuable
only
in
so
far
as
there
are
stretches
of
wood
and
listening
make
birds
be
birds
and
poppies
be
poppies
and
astronomers
be
astronomers
this
is
the
third
supposition
when
this
you
see
more
having
and
more
having
were
having
a
very
little
longer
and
shorter
conversation
whether
standing
or
sitting
everybody
is
rich
quietly
everybody
is
as
long
speech
very
romantic
such
as
my
mother
had
read
to
me
out
of
a
book
by
a
mr
congreve
an
englishman
and
recite
it
to
her
it
turned
out
that
there
was
no
immediate
need
of
preparing
myself
for
this
pleasant
task
the
length
of
the
carry
from
the
third
pond
to
the
little
brook
that
fell
into
dead
river
was
three
miles
three
miles
we
thought
with
the
memories
of
our
other
carries
behind
us
was
nothing
but
three
miles
and
so
we
double
loaded
our
canoe
piling
our
stores
at
the
ends
so
that
we
would
not
break
it
in
the
middle
and
set
off
among
the
bateaumen
of
greene
s
division
for
withers
of
a
mountain
very
steep
so
that
the
skin
on
our
shoulders
was
rubbed
backward
very
cruelly
then
for
another
mile
we
traveled
easily
down
the
opposite
slope
of
the
mountain
disregardful
of
the
manner
in
which
the
skin
on
our
shoulders
was
being
rubbed
forward
and
hailing
each
other
jocosely
at
the
ease
with
which
we
progressed
even
though
our
legs
ached
as
though
they
would
bend
and
snap
under
us
and
the
skin
of
our
faces
burned
from
our
exertions
until
we
might
near
have
fried
a
flounder
on
them
and
finally
ahead
of
us
we
saw
a
long
green
meadow
level
and
beautiful
dotted
here
and
there
with
thickets
and
edged
with
a
heavy
growth
of
spruces
and
cedars
though
neither
hobomok
nor
i
could
remember
this
meadow
from
our
trip
of
many
years
before
nor
indeed
could
we
remember
any
of
the
great
carrying
place
since
it
was
a
firm
trail
sheltered
by
heavy
trees
when
we
knew
it
where
now
it
was
a
broad
churned
road
the
feet
of
monstrous
heavy
wayfarers
so
with
light
hearts
we
stepped
out
onto
this
fair
meadow
and
then
we
saw
what
we
had
not
realized
until
we
set
foot
on
it
that
it
was
a
bed
of
rich
green
moss
growing
over
a
foul
heavy
mud
of
prodigious
sliminess
so
that
our
legs
sank
into
the
mud
well
nigh
to
the
knee
at
each
step
if
there
had
been
only
the
mud
to
suck
at
our
trembling
muscles
i
make
no
doubt
that
we
would
have
come
to
bog
brook
with
no
harm
done
save
a
little
time
expended
but
under
the
mud
there
were
the
jagged
stumps
of
ancient
trees
and
the
barbs
of
decayed
branches
the
graveyard
of
a
forest
that
had
died
from
floods
and
fallen
before
mountain
storms
as
all
ancient
forests
have
fallen
in
these
northern
woods
the
stumps
and
barbs
tore
at
our
water
soaked
shoes
and
moccasins
and
at
the
skin
beneath
nor
was
there
any
manner
in
which
we
could
avoid
them
or
protect
ourselves
from
them
slip
down
at
each
step
nearly
to
a
sitting
position
until
our
feet
had
reached
a
foundation
and
then
we
would
lift
the
canoe
forward
eight
inches
or
even
a
foot
and
then
drag
our
feet
from
the
mud
and
take
another
step
there
was
one
fool
near
the
center
of
the
meadow
i
remember
one
of
a
crew
of
bateaumen
who
would
scream
horribly
at
intervals
shrieking
there
s
something
near
my
feet
or
i
just
stepped
on
something
or
i
know
i
walked
on
a
fish
in
the
course
of
time
after
this
fool
had
screamed
there
would
be
a
shout
of
what
is
it
from
the
entire
line
of
soldiers
whereupon
the
fool
would
shriek
fish
and
we
would
move
forward
another
eight
inches
in
the
course
of
time
we
came
to
narrow
bog
brook
its
waters
brown
and
smelling
of
deadness
but
each
of
us
as
he
reached
it
lowered
himself
into
it
soused
himself
up
and
down
until
the
sweat
and
the
slime
and
the
stench
of
the
mud
had
gone
from
him
thereupon
desirous
of
seeing
no
more
of
the
great
carrying
place
ever
those
whose
luggage
was
entirely
carried
set
off
down
bog
brook
one
by
one
and
we
could
hear
them
across
the
meadow
that
separates
the
brook
from
dead
river
bawling
at
each
other
as
they
went
poling
up
against
the
river
s
sluggish
current
as
for
those
others
who
had
brought
only
a
part
of
their
belongings
they
would
set
off
across
the
dreadful
meadow
again
sinking
through
the
fair
level
green
moss
into
the
foul
mud
pitching
forward
or
sideways
as
their
feet
struck
the
snags
and
barbs
of
the
stumps
beneath
and
dragging
out
their
blackened
feet
and
legs
and
struggling
slowly
onward
when
we
had
washed
ourselves
we
stored
our
baggage
on
a
little
knoll
of
high
land
on
the
far
side
of
the
brook
and
without
more
ado
set
off
down
bog
brook
ourselves
i
knew
when
we
turned
there
was
little
use
in
following
the
bateaux
upstream
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
natanis
would
do
one
of
two
things
either
send
a
messenger
to
me
at
night
when
he
had
located
me
or
watch
for
me
himself
at
the
point
where
i
must
enter
dead
river
therefore
we
turned
downstream
away
from
the
bateaux
and
drifted
with
the
current
there
were
three
crows
on
a
tall
pine
a
little
downstream
from
us
and
as
we
drifted
the
three
of
them
sprang
into
the
it
with
an
excited
cawing
and
flew
directly
toward
a
twisted
bull
pine
that
stood
in
a
thicket
on
the
far
side
of
the
river
around
this
tree
they
circled
and
as
they
did
so
other
crows
came
from
downstream
and
swerved
and
swooped
over
the
tree
raising
an
outcry
that
came
faintly
to
us
hobomok
grinned
and
drove
the
canoe
downstream
natanis
is
talking
to
the
crows
he
said
we
went
ashore
abreast
of
the
old
bull
pine
and
in
the
thicket
beneath
it
we
as
were
we
to
see
them
it
had
been
many
years
since
i
had
seen
natanis
yet
he
had
changed
almost
not
at
all
from
the
boy
we
had
rescued
from
and
the
return
of
his
first
born
son
fernando
as
well
as
the
safe
return
of
the
rescued
prisoners
announced
a
three
days
holiday
and
sent
out
invitations
to
his
friends
to
come
and
join
with
them
on
this
gala
occasion
they
came
from
near
and
far
in
goodly
numbers
it
mattered
not
how
many
just
so
they
came
care
free
and
ready
to
take
part
in
the
games
dances
wrestling
matches
and
the
singing
there
was
an
abundance
of
food
but
none
of
the
guests
came
empty
handed
and
all
expected
to
have
a
good
time
the
dances
of
the
early
california
indians
differed
greatly
from
those
of
other
indians
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
when
seen
at
night
in
the
enchanting
light
of
the
moon
or
a
blazing
campfire
the
effect
was
startling
and
bizarre
these
dances
were
only
indulged
in
the
circle
sometimes
chanting
to
the
stamping
steps
and
grunts
of
the
males
father
jacob
baegert
who
had
been
in
charge
of
one
of
the
lower
california
missions
left
the
following
description
of
their
ancient
dances
their
dances
consist
in
a
foolish
irregular
gesticulating
and
jumping
or
advancing
and
walking
in
a
circle
yet
they
take
such
delight
in
these
amusements
that
they
spend
whole
nights
in
their
performance
these
pastimes
though
innocent
in
themselves
had
to
be
rigidly
interdicted
because
the
grossest
disorders
and
vices
were
openly
perpetrated
by
the
natives
during
the
performances
but
it
is
hardly
possible
to
prevent
them
from
indulging
in
their
sports
the
younger
element
cared
less
for
dancing
but
it
seemed
to
be
fond
of
wrestling
and
a
simple
and
almost
childlike
gambling
game
that
consisted
in
guessing
in
which
hand
a
stick
of
wood
or
shell
was
held
on
the
last
night
of
the
fiesta
martin
reyes
who
loved
all
kinds
of
manly
sports
easily
defeated
cuyamac
the
strongest
and
most
an
unsuccessful
suitor
for
the
hand
of
natooka
cuyamac
greatly
chagrined
at
his
defeat
and
jealous
of
the
favor
shown
reyes
by
natooka
and
many
others
as
well
was
overheard
making
threats
against
the
life
of
reyes
there
was
still
another
element
that
cared
not
at
all
for
the
tribal
games
or
dances
but
preferred
a
far
more
interesting
pastime
a
game
known
the
world
over
and
it
was
cojuati
sister
of
topanque
who
was
trying
to
instruct
manuel
machado
in
the
rudiments
of
the
ancient
game
hoping
thereby
to
overcome
his
bashfulness
it
was
to
prove
a
difficult
task
but
her
ardent
nature
and
her
sincere
belief
that
success
would
crown
her
efforts
made
the
work
an
enjoyable
pastime
love
making
is
an
art
and
cojuati
was
a
past
mistress
of
all
its
intricacies
and
unknown
to
machado
she
was
gradually
weaving
about
him
a
net
that
finally
enmeshed
the
gallant
soldier
and
held
him
captive
to
her
charms
martin
reyes
had
been
in
such
great
demand
since
his
arrival
not
seen
much
of
natooka
but
now
that
he
had
completed
the
lengthy
program
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
which
had
included
playing
the
guitar
singing
duets
with
fernando
some
spanish
love
songs
dancing
the
fandango
bolero
and
other
old
fashioned
spanish
dances
and
as
a
finale
the
wrestling
match
with
cuyamac
he
joined
natooka
the
senorita
of
his
dreams
together
they
walked
off
into
the
night
father
amurrio
the
guest
of
honor
at
topanque
s
rancheria
was
looked
upon
as
a
superman
by
the
savages
although
he
had
so
far
acquired
only
a
smattering
of
the
dialect
used
by
topanque
s
tribe
he
made
good
use
of
it
in
telling
them
about
some
of
the
fiestas
he
had
enjoyed
as
a
boy
in
spain
then
gradually
he
began
to
interest
them
in
more
serious
stories
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
s
entertainment
and
long
past
the
customary
bedtime
hour
he
asked
fernando
to
act
as
his
interpreter
while
he
told
them
of
a
wonderful
fiesta
recounted
in
the
bible
how
one
of
christ
s
disciples
had
betrayed
him
with
a
kiss
and
how
his
name
had
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
as
the
man
who
sold
his
soul
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
the
story
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
indians
at
the
close
as
a
tribute
to
topanque
and
his
people
father
amurrio
asked
fernando
to
recite
the
lord
s
prayer
in
his
native
tongue
serra
in
mexico
father
serra
accompanied
by
a
fifteen
year
old
indian
boy
named
juan
evangelista
one
of
the
first
of
the
monterey
converts
had
safely
reached
san
blas
a
port
on
the
western
coast
of
mexico
the
day
following
his
arrival
there
he
left
for
tepic
a
small
inland
town
some
distance
from
san
blas
where
the
franciscans
maintained
a
convent
known
as
the
hospice
de
santa
cruz
where
serra
intended
to
rest
a
few
days
before
leaving
on
his
long
overland
journey
to
the
capital
besides
the
two
burros
which
father
serra
and
juan
evangelista
were
riding
they
had
two
which
they
were
slowly
traveling
frequently
dipped
into
beautiful
valleys
and
rose
up
over
rugged
and
picturesque
mountains
that
awed
the
young
indian
lad
who
had
never
beheld
such
a
wondrous
sight
before
several
days
after
leaving
tepic
father
serra
complained
of
having
a
severe
headache
and
as
it
grew
worse
he
decided
after
having
reached
a
suitable
camp
site
to
rest
awhile
evangelista
helped
him
to
dismount
and
quickly
arranged
blankets
and
pillows
to
make
the
father
comfortable
it
was
quite
a
new
experience
for
the
young
indian
to
have
a
sick
man
to
care
for
as
he
looked
at
father
serra
he
noticed
that
he
was
breathing
very
heavily
and
his
half
opened
eyes
seemed
wholly
unconscious
of
his
surroundings
this
began
to
worry
evangelista
and
he
did
nt
know
what
to
do
looking
about
him
he
saw
a
small
adobe
cabin
some
distance
away
and
after
waiting
a
while
longer
hoping
that
father
serra
might
wake
up
he
decided
to
walk
over
to
the
cabin
and
there
remained
golf
which
bart
suspected
he
pursued
principally
as
an
agreeable
form
of
killing
time
and
his
daughter
it
had
been
only
within
the
last
year
or
so
that
bart
had
resumed
relations
with
gill
the
latter
had
made
the
advances
admitting
frankly
he
was
proud
of
bart
s
fame
was
pleased
to
claim
kinship
they
had
not
much
in
common
having
developed
along
different
lines
and
now
they
had
reached
middle
age
with
points
of
view
regarding
life
and
society
widely
at
variance
bart
had
been
drawn
to
gill
by
sympathy
for
him
his
brother
was
lonely
and
except
for
his
devotion
to
sylvia
talked
and
acted
like
a
man
who
the
way
he
turned
to
bart
with
the
latter
s
fuller
life
and
more
engaging
contacts
for
companionship
and
confidences
bart
was
not
at
all
sure
what
he
thought
of
his
brother
since
boyhood
gill
had
lived
solely
for
himself
cultivating
profitable
friendships
improving
his
circumstances
ignoring
obligations
gill
was
an
opportunist
dulling
his
ears
shutting
his
eyes
to
anything
and
everything
not
immediately
of
service
to
him
having
won
all
he
desired
he
had
come
to
his
fifties
to
find
nothing
left
for
which
to
strive
and
then
unexpectedly
and
undeservedly
within
the
past
two
years
sylvia
had
suddenly
blossomed
forth
radiant
and
beautiful
filling
her
father
s
life
to
overflowing
and
this
belated
affection
the
only
really
unselfish
love
he
had
ever
known
had
softened
and
humanized
him
pathetic
figure
though
he
was
to
day
bart
was
conscious
of
a
definite
reservation
in
regard
to
his
respect
for
him
he
could
not
banish
the
memory
of
the
time
when
gill
had
left
his
mother
brothers
and
the
early
years
of
his
own
and
peggy
s
struggle
in
new
york
when
a
friendly
hand
or
an
encouraging
word
would
have
done
much
to
hearten
and
make
things
easy
for
them
yet
withal
bart
was
drawn
to
him
the
older
man
reached
out
for
companionship
the
younger
said
to
himself
as
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
studio
apartment
building
in
which
he
lived
perhaps
he
did
gill
an
injustice
perhaps
the
man
had
really
changed
at
heart
and
had
come
to

the
lofty
studio
he
loved
this
room
he
and
mildred
had
planned
every
detail
of
its
furnishing
at
one
end
was
a
tall
wide
window
of
prismed
glass
and
gauze
curtains
which
might
be
adjusted
with
a
long
bamboo
pole
at
night
the
whole
could
be
obliterated
by
thick
folds
of
turquoise
blue
velvet
a
balcony
ran
along
one
side
with
a
rather
precipitous
staircase
leading
from
it
to
the
studio
floor
and
on
the
side
opposite
the
great
window
stood
a
hooded
stone
fireplace
of
noble
proportions
which
projected
ten
feet
into
the
room
a
large
oil
by
matisse
smaller
canvases
of
cezanne
picasso
and
other
moderns
and
an
italian
altar
cloth
of
matchless
gold
needlework
surrounded
by
a
lark

crimson
border
covered
the
bare
paneling
of

it
s
my

him
with
its
disorder
i
like
it
this
way
it
looks
lived
in
used
and
besides
it
has
the
kind
of
atmosphere
in
which
i
can
write
i
never
liked
the
spick
and
spanness
of
the
taormina
villa
the
north
window
was
a
pale
luminous
square
to
night
filling
the
studio
with
ghostly
light
and
ghostly
shadows
burns
drew
together
the
velvet
hangings
and
bart
jerked
the
chains
dangling
to
three
bulbs
of
a
jeweled
lamp
which
stood
on
the
cluttered
desk
instantly
the
room
was
transformed
into
one
of
dim
beauty
and
romance
the
shadows
deepening
softening
warm
tones
touching
kindly
the
surfaces
of
the
heavy
furniture
caressing
their
outlines
spreading
like
a
gracious
tide
over
the
heavily
rugged
floor

small
neat
pile

of

extended
slides
of

played
guadalupe
high
last
friday
night
in
their
gym
and
beat
them
to
i
got
a
chance
to
start
but
the
coach
pulled
me
out
when
he
thought
i
was
hurt
dan
is
expecting
to
go
to
stanford
next
fall
he
has
college
board
credits
and
needs
only
more
but
they
are
awfully
strict
up
there
guess
i
ll
go
to
cow
college
at
cal
uncle
jack
says
he
thinks
that
s
the
place
for
me
he
wants
me
to
study
viticulture
but
i
m
not
very
stuck
on
it
ile
gave
me
a
great
we
call
him
puzzle
because
he
s
so
hard
to
get
onto
joke
ile
can
go
like
the
dickens
as
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
to
say
i
will
close
your
loving
son
john
the
other
letter
was
from
margaret
written
neatly
in
up
and
in
gemini
you
re
right
but
is
nt
astrology
rather
piffle
yes
but
so
would
mathematics
be
if
they
taught
you
twice
five
are
eleven
calling
things
piffle
wo
nt
take
the
jupiter
influence
out
of
your
life
joe
did
not
care
to
argue
about
astrology
who
taught
you
such
good
english
he
asked
i
never
learned
any
bad
english
until
i
talked
to
an
englishman
there
was
almost
a
war
between
hawkesey
and
me
to
see
which
could
corrupt
the
other
i
t
was
funny
i
liked
the
swear
words
and
that
shocked
him
because
hawkesey
is
a
puritan
underneath
the
surface
he
began
to
try
to
talk
like
an
officer
with
a
hot
potato
in
his
mouth
and
half
his
syllables
missing
so
i
swore
each
time
he
mispronounced
a
word
and
i
had
to
swear
so
often
that
he
went
away
all
alone
and
practised
how
to
speak
in
order
to
save
my
soul
from
hell
do
you
consider
yourself
an
indian
funny
hawkesey
asked
that
question
the
first
black
lightday
he
met
me
is
a
bird
in
an
oven
a
cake
because
i
am
caged
in
india
am
i
indian
my
friends
are
indian
if
you
mean
by
that
that
they
were
born
here
but
so
was
i
i
have
the
kindest
friends
that
were
ever
patient
with
a
strange
bird
in
their
high
nest
it
was
so
high
in
the
treetops
that
i
used
to
be
afraid
of
falling
out
particularly
when
the
wind
blew
but
they
taught
me
to
fly
and
i
have
flown
and
i
have
brought
back
food
for
them
do
you
know
who
your
father
and
mother
were
yes
amal
told
me
it
was
sweet
of
them
to
bring
me
to
be
born
in
india
they
must
have
been
lovely
people
so
i
suppose
the
lords
of
life
let
them
go
as
soon
as
i
was
born
they
may
have
had
trouble
enough
and
destiny
take
its
course
they
might
have
tried
to
struggle
against
destiny
and
i
think
they
were
nt
the
kind
of
people
who
deserve
such
torture
so
they
were
let
die
very
swiftly
and
i
dare
say
the
darlings
thought
dying
was
dreadful
until
they
found
themselves
out
of
their
bodies
do
you
believe
in
an
after
life
she
chuckled
who
wants
to
believe
in
anything
i
insist
on
knowing
do
nt
you
do

talk

you
could
nt
you
do

yet
that

william

aristotle

all
of
them
how
do
you
know
i
too
have
read
them
how
else
should
i
know
they
are
babies
arguing
in

dime
aons
although
if
they
would
stop
for
a
minute
to
tl
of
dimensions
they
are
pretty
conscious
of
at

five
however
philosophers
do
nt
think
it
is
not
respectable
some
day
one
of
the
gods
will
throw
an
apple
at

at

then
they
will
wake
up

going
joe
asked

may
i

home
no
it
would
offend
my
escort
they
are
gentlemen
who
have
foregone
sleep
after
a
long
day
s
soldiering
merely
because
it
pleases
them
to
protect
my
dignity
as
they
express
it
i
must
snub
you
rather
than
offend
them
life
is
a
matter
of
choosing
between
predicaments
may
i
see
you
again
how
can
you
avoid
that
if
that
is
destined
you
believe
in
destiny
it
makes
no
difference
to
destiny
whether
we
believe
or
not
but
you
do
nt
believe
then
why
not
try
going
away
there
are
airplanes
take
one
then
you
will
soon
know
whether
destiny
has
other
intentions
you
advise
that
why
not
it
wo
nt
hurt
you
good
night
he
thought
her
parting
smile
was
wistful
although
he
was
not
sure
she
and
sadness
seemed
to
have
no
bond
in
common
and
yet
perhaps
it
was
his
own
lack
of
pleasure
in
life
that
made
him
see
her
through
a
sad
lense
or
perhaps
it
was
moonlight
he
could
feel
his
heart
thumping
and
it
made
him
angry
he
was
a
roaster
of
men
and
millions
not
a
silly
emotional
ass
to
be
stirred
out
of
his
proper
orbit
by
a
girl
s
smile
ile
wondered
what
color
her
eyes
were
how
little
and
light
she
looked
how
tall
and
graceful
when
the
ayah
followed
and
touched
her
sari
that
she
wore
like
a
roman
toga
how
small
when
the
seven
man
escort
formed
up
wo
by
two
and
tramped
behind
her
one
man
grunting
gruff
commands
and
giving
probably
a
thousand
pounds
or
so
of
bearded
bone
and
muscle
fit
to
fight
its
weight
in
anything
that
breathed
tamed
by
a
girl
who
walked
like
something
flowing
in

joe
turned
about
and
found
hawkes
facing
him

drew
near
and
squatted
with
his
basket
in

of
joe
how
do
you
like

asked
she
s
surprising
what
does
that
fool
want
now
nothing
i
mean
anything

i
kick
him
no

him

strode
to
where
the

waited
with
their
reins
tied
to
a
grinning
god

leg
by
the
fountain
in
the
shadow
beneath
the

the

crouched
shrugging
herself
damn
you
he
told
her
you
stink
and
you
harmony
go
home
do
you
hear
me
beat
it
but
the
ayah
watched
dumbly
until
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
when
he
rode
away
she
followed
like
a
good
dog

joe
s
first
reaction
took
the
form
of
anger
against
hawkes
and
annie
seems
to
have
allowed
a
white
girl
which
might
be
so
greatly
to
own
advantage
kip
sent
to
maggie
may
a
letter
which
had
been
written
an
revised
and
torn
up
and
written
again
several
times
in
its
fin
version
it
did
not
go
into
particulars
about
the
night
life
of
ma
hattan
and
the
tendency
of
successful
dramatists
to
fall
in
lo
with
their
leading
ladies
no
it
could
not
bring
itself
to
hint
things
so
teche
country
it
was
a
missive
reserved
but
solemn
in
ton
and
perhaps
more
alarming
for
what
it
failed
to
say
it
inform
miss
maggie
may
that
new
york
was
a
city
of
many
temptation
and
that
men
of
genius
were
emotional
and
roger
in
particular
was
too
generous
now
he
needed
help
and
there
was
no
one
wh
could
give
it
quite
so
well
as
his
sister
at
least
that
was
how
it
seemed
to
kip
and
he
hoped
that
mis
maggie
may
would
excuse
him
for
his
boldness
also
he
hoped
tha
she
would
never
tell
roger
what
he
had
done
because
roger
resented
interference
with
his
affairs
and
if
the
visit
were
to
do
an
good
miss
maggie
may
would
have
to
think
up
some
reasons
o
her
own
for
coming
the
letter
added
very
humbly
that
of
course
kip
would
he
glad
to
see
her
again
and
to
do
anything
he
could
to
make
things
easy
for
her
no
that
last
was
one
and
finally
cut
out
entirely
because
of
the
possibility
that
it
might
sound
like
the
shadow
of
a
nit
that
the
tarleton
house
had
vacant
rooms
maggie
may
answered
promptly
she
understood
the
meaning
hip
s
warnings
and
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
it
was
very
but
perhaps
the
trouble
was
hereditary
and
they
should
not
me
poor
roger
too
severely
she
would
come
and
do
the
best
u
could
her
cousin
mrs
fessenden
had
invited
her
several
times
to
pay
a
visit
and
that
would
be
the
easiest
way
to
arrange
at
tors
maggie
may
was
writing
to
mrs
fessenden
at
once
and
would
let
kip
know
of
the
arrangements
certainly
she
would
cr
mention
to
anyone
but
her
mother
kip
s
part
in
the
matter
thanked
him
again
and
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
see
him
she
wrote
again
in
a
week
or
so
she
was
coming
to
new
york
a
few
days
kip
was
in
a
fine
glow
of
excitement
with
many
problems
to
occupy
meet
maggie
may
or
would
her
relatives
those
rich
and
important
perms
think
he
was
butting
in
and
what
would
roger
do
about
lilian
ashton
roger
had
never
told
his
people
that
he
had
quit
the
tarleton
house
his
mail
from
home
still
came
there
how
could
he
explain
to
his
sister
the
address
in
the
apartment
hotel
ml
what
excuse
would
he
give
for
never
inviting
her
there
kip
put
the
problem
up
to
jerry
who
laughed
and
said
that
sooner
later
maggie
may
was
going
to
have
to
wake
up
to
the
realities
the
world
about
her
and
probably
it
would
be
sooner
sisters
were
nt
such
dubs
nowadays
but
kip
insisted
that
maggie
mayas
different
from
any
and
all
other
girls
jerry
said
how
old
as
she
must
be
twenty
now
kip
said
twenty
one
and
jerry
wed
you
keep
track
of
her
birthdays
do
you
what
you
ter
do
kid
is
get
busy
this
trip
and
not
let
her
wither
did
not
fail
to
think
of
this
problem
lilian
ashton
it
was
presently
made
known
that
he
was
more
d
of
her
than
ever
and
had
decided
to
go
out
and
stay
with
fessendens
for
a
while
he
would
occupy
that
cottage
which
cousin
had
offered
him
and
spend
his
time
thinking
out
a
new
y
it
was
springtime
and
the
country
would
be
pleasant
and
would
take
long
walks
and
renew
old
times
with
his
sister
kip
a
thrill
over
this
how
delightful
to
a
born
reformer
to
play
role
of
guardian
angel
and
guide
men
s
destinies
without
their
ing
the
least
idea
of
it
the
afternoon
came
and
kip
was
invited
by
roger
to
join
the
welcome
he
put
on
his
best
suit
of
clothes
which
tayl
tibbs
had
brought
back
from
the
cleaner
s
and
from
which
mother
and
aunt
picked
the
last
scrap
of
lint
he
had
a
ne
fedora
hat
and
a
pair
of
gloves
to
match
his
mother
having
accompanied
him
and
v
much
fussed
up
and
elated
he
met
roger
at
the
pennsylvania
station
and
roger
by
some
magic
known
to
celebrities
obtain
permission
to
go
clown
to
the
tracks
where
the
train
came
in
th
was
maggie
may
descending
from
a
car
in
a
blue
silk
dress
a
little
straw
hat
for
springtime
with
a
bunch
of
blue
bells
on
it
kip
saw
everything
in
a
flash
and
would
love
blue
bells
and
bl
dresses
forever
and
forever
after
she
was
a
grown
young
lady
now
very
sedate
yet
happy
so
glad
to
see
them
she
came
hurrying
and
gave
roger
a
hug
she
went
on
hugging
him
until
the
tears
came
into
her
ey
she
shook
both
of
kip
s
hands
and
stood
looking
the
two
men
first
one
and
then
the
other
oh
roger
you
are
pale
and
thi
you
have
been
overworking
it
was
the
tact
of
a
girl
who
w
used
to
managing
men
to
say
you
have
overworking
was
dignified
to
kip
s
said
you
do
nt
look
a
day
older
and
that
was
not
so
goo
because
kip
was
tired
of
being
the
kid
and
having
jerry
t
him
he
would
never
grow
up
till
he
cut
loose
from
his
mother
s
apron
strings
he
was
almost
twenty
four
now
but
stood
the
as
much
rattled
as
a
schoolboy
maggie
may
told
them
scraps
of
news
from
home
and
what
s
of
a
trip
she
had
had
and
how
glad
she
was
again
and
the
maggie
s
lad
sent
them
and
how
he
had
planted
another
she
said
smiling
at
them
through
her
clear
unhidden
tears
i
am
so
glad
her
small
teeth
shone
in
her
pale
quivering
mouth
i
am
so
glad
it
is
so
she
said
charlotte
nicolas
was
trying
to
say
to
the
bleat
of
the
children

they
played

following
up
the
wind
and
the
big
brilliant
sea
gathered
softly
under
charlotte
s
chin
i
shall
speak
of
it
soon
to
jean
she
said
firmly
blowing
her
small
nose
i
may
have
a
little
trouble
making
him
understand
she
said
but
it
s
going
to
be
all
right
everything
that
i
suggest
to
him
at
first
it
takes
him
a
day
or
two
to
understand
monique
crouched
back
on
her
heels
watching
them
all
and
suddenly
charlotte
began
to
speak
again
to
them
there
is
something
else
too
i
want
to
tell
you
she
said
watching
bridget
shyly
there
is
something
else
she
said
she
sat
looking
shyly
at
bridget
did
you
know
she
said
to
her
did
maman
tell
you
yet
bridget
looked
into
charlotte
s
eyes
and
shook
her
head
charlotte
s
lids
lifted
for
of
her
bosom
approached
the
sun
stained
crescent
which
lay
about
her
throat
bridget
suddenly
and
distinctly
knew
i
m
going
to
give
you
another
little
nephew
or
niece
she
said
she
had
turned
a
rosy
red
and
she
was
laughing
oh
what
a
wretched
business
said
nicolas
in
real
distress
lolotte
you
re
only
thirty
two
and
five
of
them
already
is
nt
it
time
you
decided
whether
your
responsibility
is
to
the
living
or
to
the
unconceived
it
was
all
a
sort
of
joke
to
charlotte
she
sat
in
the
sand
shaking
her
head
and
laughing
one
more
wo
nt
matter
she
said
it
s
my
life
is
nt
it
upon
the
homeward
ride
nicolas
shyly
took
bridget
sphand
and
drew
it
through
his
arm
how
will
you
like
it
how
will
you
like
being
in
north
africa
he
said
his
voice
was
soft
and
whispering
close
in
her
ear
and
neck
hidden
from
charlotte
and
in
great
humility
to
her
shy
and
apologetic
scarcely
daring
to
look
into
her
face
it
will
be
too
wonderful
she
said
he
held
her
fingers
tightly
in
his
palm
he
sat
close
to
her
holding
her
hand
as
though
there
was
so
much
he
wished
to
say
to
her
but
not
a
word
of
it
could
he
force
from
his
lips
i
have
been
terribly
worried
bridget
he
said
suddenly
he
lifted
her
hand
against
his
cheek
i
have
been
crazy
with
worry
about
what
we
should
ever
do
he
said
into
her
palm
oh
sweet
children
said
charlotte
to
them
teasing
them
and
laughing
as
they
sat
holding
hands
in
the
deep
cushions
of
the
car
now
i
see
you
happy
she
said
but
now
that
things
are
arranged
i
ca
nt
ever
let
you
go
i
shall
die
without
my
bridget
and
my
nicol
she
said
bridget
had
not
yet
really
nicolas
words
and
charlotte
s
talking
of
this
to
her
it
became
an
actual
thing
to
go
to
go
away
to
go
away
to
another
country
to
go
so
far
away
to
go
so
far
away
from
what
she
asked
herself
all
the
way
home
in
the
car
up
the
white
road
and
down
the
valleys
soaring
screaming
out
at
turns
all
the
way
home
she
sorted
the
litter
the
bits
of
ribbon
the
remnants
of
disorder
in
her
mind
this
feeling
of
relinquishment
in
her
was
foul
as
a
rat
trap
and
stiff
and
relentless
there
like
a
dried
bouquet
this
is
what
becomes
of
idleness
she
thought
in
anger
she
wanted
the
whole
summer
back
again
to
make
it
all
anew
why
am
i
having
these
bunches
of
old
lavender
these
dried
knots
of
garlic
infecting
the
thoughts
that
i
have
why
this
chop
suey
mess
of
uncertainty
in
me
down
the
drive
they
swept
with
a
splatter
of
gravel
upon
the
bridge
table
and
far
away
from
what
thought
bridget
as
she
looked
through
the
window
at
the
faces
of
maman
and
papa
and
jean
and
the
three
girls
to
go
so
far
away
from
what
she
thought
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
car
but
before
she
had
time
to
take
a
step
towards
them
the
girls
had
rushed
up
to
her
waving
their
elation
in
their
exultant
hands
luc
luc
luc
they
cried
as
they
surrounded
her
each
one
of
them
had
a
letter
from
luc
and
before
bridget
could
have
her
tea
even
she
must
sit
down
with
them
and
listen
to
every
word
that
luc
had
to
say
luc
they
said
to
her
as
if
it
were
a
caress
luc
as
if
the
mere
dwelling
upon
it
could
prolong
it
into
syllables
of
sound
luc
thought
bridget
as
she
sat
listening
to
them
reading
out
his
polite
small
words
luc
luc
luc
to
marthe
his
letter
was
a
sign
to
walk
slowly
out
into
the
road
that
had
been
built
by
peasants
to
go
from
field
to
market
and
from
farm
to
farm
and
which
did
not
linger
by
the
side
of
the
rance
castle
island
was
a
melting
vision
between
the
tree
stems
for
charlotte
had
been
allowed
to
plant
them
this
way
to
conceal
the
dock
s
stone
walls
luc
in
rennes
now
strong
and
bitter
as
stone
to
be
washed
against
by
little
ripples
of
love
to
be
caressed
by
cloud
kisses
marthe
s
face
flushed
with
shame
at
the
thought
of
this
but
now
it
was
begun
and
ringing
in
her
she
would
be
soft
as
the
flowering
crest
of
the
river
s
salted
wave
soft
as
the
evening
and
the
dry
floury
sand
for
all
that
was
doctor
shell
competence
in
him
must
be
breaking
in
him
like
a
heart
for
gentleness
to
marthe
it
was
a
sign
to
come
to
bridget
s
room
and
look
in
the
glass
for
a
long
time
at
her
face
at
the
new
fifteen
story
sky
scrapers
by
a
broker
who
was
to
take
her
to
luchow
s
did
not
even
occur
to
her
what
did
occur
to
her
must
have
flashed
into
her
telephone
home
not
to
wait
dinner
when
i
am
detained
will
you
come
it
s
been
so
long
since
we
have
had
a
talk
i
feel
the
need
of
it
ray
standing
there
it
came
over
her
with
finality
what
she
knew
to
be
her
inability
to
deny
him
the
coming
together
of
ray
schmidt
and
walter
saxel
was
something
so
gradual
so
innocent
of
scheme
or
plan
that
its
course
was
unmarked
by
the
concrete
incident
of
reaching
their
conclusion
it
was
impossible
looking
back
for
ray
to
determine
exactly
when
she
reached
her
decision
to
leave
blarney
s
where
she
had
spent
six
years
of
her
life
in
new
york
more
than
that
it
was
even
difficult
to
go
back
over
those
conversations
with
walter
that
had
dwelt
upon
the
feasibility
of
a
flat
certainly
there
was
in
ray
the
day
some
two
months
following
the
encounter
as
she
rode
in
a
cab
holding
on
to
hat
boxes
and
minor
baggage
consciousness
that
in
traversing
the
short
distance
from
west
fifty
third
street
she
was
crossing
the
vast
steppes
which
separate
respectability
from
denande
but
not
in
the
sense
of
any
overpowering
realization
that
she
was
burning
bridges
after
her
there
had
never
been
an
instant
in
the
years
intervening
between
that
first
meeting
in
front
of
the
c
h
and
d
and
this
sharp
transition
in
her
life
brought
about
by
the
step
she
was
now
taking
that
subconsciously
she
had
not
been
prepared
to
do
not
necessarily
this
but
whatever
was
wanted
or
desired
by
the
one
human
being
in
the
world
whose
wish
was
her
law
even
back
in
the
cincinnati
days
walter
she
now
realized
could
have
had
this
for
the
asking
this
or
less
or
more
everything
or
as
he
had
chosen
to
decide
nothing
as
he
would
then
as
now
in
fact
she
caught
herself
thinking
one
day
in
the
solitude
to
which
she
was
to
become
so
inured
it
is
sweeter
this
way
in
almost
any
her
isolation
into
a
corner
of
his
life
was
to
become
more
complete
as
affairs
between
them
became
more
and
more
clandestine
this
way
it
was
all
or
nothing
yes
it
was
sweeter
here
was
a
situation
that
unfolded
itself
not
by
machination
but
as
naturally
as
a
flower
unfolds
itself
the
talk
about
the
flat
had
been
scrappy
and
chiefly
when
he
began
to
find
it
difficult
to
determine
upon
places
for
them
to
meet
or
dine
in
order
that
their
presence
would
not
seem
repetitious
or
conspicuous
as
a
means
to
an
end
indecision
doubts
of
her
which
had
so
characterized
their
early
days
seemed
to
have
vanished
because
he
said
to
her
so
simply
that
her
heart
did
not
even
quicken
by
a
beat
ray
this
ca
nt
go
on
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
have
a
place
of
our
own
where
i
can
come
without
all
this
scheming
yes
walter
we
need
a
flat
some
place
where
kind
of
thing
can
not
go
on
without
becoming
conspicuous
even
in
a
city
like
this
i
ve
thought
of
that
you
have
so
much
to
consider
i
want
you
to
feel
about
all
this
ray
as
a
frenchwoman
would
feel
about
it
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
my
feeling
for
you
and
my
feeling
for
my
wife
and
children
are
things
separate
and
apart
i
can
be
loyal
to
both
these
feelings
because
they
are
so
different
should
she
despise
him
for
that
the
thought
rushed
to
her
that
now
was
the
last
instant
of
her
last
opportunity
to
keep
her
life
her
intact
own
to
refuse
to
become
part
of
an
active
disloyalty
to
the
wife
of
a
man
who
coveted
and
was
coveted
in
return
to
refuse
to
become
the
mistress
of
a
man
who
took
pains
to
establish
this
wife
s
footing
on
the
very
eve
of
her
surrender
to
his
convenience
there
was
yet
time
but
so
fleeting
shall
you
find
the
place
the
flat
walter
yes
it
was
better
that
way
the
talk
of
money
would
havepbeen
abominable
to
her
what
he
could
afford
or
what
he
could
not
afford
was
sure
to
be
equally
right
what
he
chose
was
a
three
room
apartment
on
the
third
floor
of
a
large
five
story
red
brick
building
on
broadway
not
remote
from
the
beginnings
of
central
park
it
was
a
rear
flat
and
the
bathroom
and
bedroom
looking
into
a
narrow
air
shaft
required
gaslight
burning
in
them
all
day
but
the
large
living
room
and
full
sized
kitchen
facing
the
backs
of
buildings
of
a
parallel
street
seventh
avenue
were
filled
with
morning
sunshine
and
remained
bright
into
late
afternoon
offhand
it
was
the
sort
of
apartment
house
that
externally
at
least
seemed
far
too
pretentious
for
the
modest
rear
flats
that
were
tucked
into
it
but
apparently
those
facingbroadway
justified
the
heavily
embossed
pressed
leather
foyer
walls
solemn
walnut
stairways
with
a
plaster
nubian
slave
on
the
they
were
of
ten
and
twelve
rooms
built
railroad
fashionalong
a
narrow
hallway
that
shot
the
entire
length
of
the
flat
and
rented
for
as
high
as
sixty
dollars
a
month
into
her
small
rear
one
furnished
in
what
walter
had
apparently
chosen
en
suite
ray
fitted
with
the
close
adjustment
of
a
hit
of
fungus
to
its
wall
snugly
and
immediately
it
became
home
to
her
the
first
premises
that
had
ever
allowed
her
the
full
privacy
of
a
kitchen
in
which
to
putter
unrestrictedly
there
was
a
parlor
set
consisting
of
five
pieces
mahogany
with
freckled
cinnamon
plush
upholstery
edged
in
ball
fringe
a
substantial
five
piece
mission
bedroomset
of
walnut
with
a
fine
clear
mirror
in
the
wardrobedoor
taboret
dresser
and
wash
stand
and
walter
s
told
himself
that
it
was
swell
and
he
was
in
luck
he
told
lucy
that
he
guessed
they
could
walk
together
at
that
he
became
suddenly
leery
and
uncertain
because
a
guy
could
never
be
sure
when
he
was
and
when
he
was
nt
saying
the
right
thing
to
a
girl
he
felt
that
he
should
have
said
something
different
to
her
he
hoped
that
he
had
nt
said
anything
that
would
make
her
sore
and
change
her
mind
so
she
would
nt
go
to
the
park
with
him
he
waited
and
worried
while
she
went
into
the
house
and
it
took
a
long
time
so
that
he
got
nervous
and
was
afraid
she
was
nt
coming
but
he
waited
anyway
he
heard
some
young
kids
in
the
shires
of
her
girl
friends
and
a
ten
year
old
punk
named
norman
something
or
other
they
were
talking
about
having
a
show
party
in
one
of
the
basements
across
the
street
they
enthusiastically
agreed
to
and
they
ran
across
the
street
looking
quite
cute
and
innocent
studs
watched
them
skip
and
said
to
himself
with
a
quizzical
look
on
his
face
jesus
christ
he
scowled
scratched
his
head
and
asked
himself
if
hepshould
tell
helen
shires
he
decided
not
to
because
he
hated
any
kind
of
a
snitcher
he
laughed
to
himself
thinking
how
funny
it
was
and
what
a
knockout
of
a
story
it
would
be
for
dan
and
the
guys
if
they
would
promise
not
to
pass
it
on
i
le
thought
of
his
kid
sister
fritzie
telling
himself
that
she
would
nt
never
do
a
thing
like
that
if
he
ever
found
her
doing
it
he
d
certainly
boot
her
tail
around
the
block
until
she
could
nt
walk
straight
but
then
he
guessed
there
was
something
in
catholic
there
was
helen
shires
she
was
fine
just
like
a
pal
or
a
guy
s
best
friend
but
then
there
was
somethingdifferent
and
purer
in
a
girl
like
lucy
which
stopped
her
from
talking
about
the
things
he
and
helen
talked
about
yes
sir
he
was
pretty
certain
about
that
something
purer
in
catholic
girls
he
laughed
because
the
little
kids
had
been
so
funny
he
thought
about
going
over
and
peeking
in
on
their
party
but
just
then
he
saw
lucy
she
came
out
wearing
a
reddish
orange
wash
dress
which
looked
nice
on
her
because
she
was
dark
curly
haired
with
red
fair
skin
and
the
dress
set
her
off
just
right
and
she
had
on
a
little
powder
and
lipstick
but
it
did
nt
make
her
look
like
a
sinful
woman
or
anything
of
that
sort
studs
did
nt
usually
pay
attention
to
how
girls
looked
except
to
notice
the
shape
of
their
legs
because
if
they
had
good
legs
they
were
supposed
to
be
good
for
you
know
to
notice
their
boobs
if
they
were
big
enough
to
bounce
he
looked
at
lucy
she
was
cute
all
right
he
told
himself
that
she
was
cute
he
told
himself
that
he
liked
her
he
repeated
to
himself
that
he
liked
her
and
she
was
cute
his
heart
beat
faster
and
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
doing
they
strolled
east
on
fifty
seventh
street
a
negro
nursemaidcame
along
with
a
bow
legged
baby
and
lucy
made
a
fuss
over
it
studs
thought
it
was
a
pain
but
he
decided
that
girls
were
girls
and
if
they
were
like
lucy
they
must
be
higher
creatures
that
a
guy
just
could
nt
understand
no
matter
how
much
he
tried
he
pretended
that
he
was
in
terested
in
the
darling
tot
but
it
gave
him
a
pain
they
strolled
on
and
studs
kept
side
glancing
at
angelic
lucy
straining
his
mind
to
think
of
something
to
say
he
said
that
it
was
a
nice
day
all
right
she
agreed
that
made
a
fellow
want
to
do
nothing
and
she
said
yes
she
said
she
liked
doing
nothing
studs
said
that
usually
he
did
nt
like
doing
nothing
but
now
he
felt
different
from
the
way
he
felt
on
most
days
he
said
that
there
was
too
much
for
a
guy
to
do
to
want
to
do
just
nothing
he
told
her
some
of
the
things
a
kid
could
do
instead
of
doing
nothing
he
told
her
how
he
red
o
connell
and
the
gang
had
gotten
red
s
beebe
gun
and
had
stood
on
red
s
porch
shooting
pigeons
and
he
had
killed
the
most
three
and
how
red
had
shot
muggsy
mccarthy
in
the
pa
the
back
and
muggsy
did
nt
know
who
shot
him
and
it
was
funny
and
then
red
had
gotten
his
old
man
s
chalmers
and
they
had
gone
riding
and
red
had
stepped
on
it
and
they
had
gone
down
south
park
avenue
fifty
miles
an
hour
and
and
they
had
broken
five
or
six
of
them
she
said
it
was
just
horrid
and
that
boys
just
wanted
to
make
mischief
as
sister
bernadette
marie
always
said
boys
had
the
germ
of
destruction
in
them
and
they
did
perfectly
awful
horrid
things
but
she
said
it
just
like
a
girl
meaning
the
exact
opposite
they
came
to
the
park
where
it
was
cooler
she
walked
more
slowly
and
they
gazed
idly
about
them
everything
was
sun
colored
and
people
walked
around
as
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
it
was
nice
out
all
right
with
the
sky
all
so
blue
and
the
clouds
all
puffed
and
white
and
floating
as
if
they
were
icebergs
in
a
sea
that
did
nt
have
any
waves
and
he
thought
it
would
be
fine
if
he
and
lucy
could
have
wings
and
fly
away
past
the
sky
he
thought
about
their
flying
away
flying
right
through
clouds
and
way
past
the
other
side
of
the
sky
where
there
was
nothing
kind
of
a
place
with
a
palace
and
servants
and
everything
they
wanted
to
make
them
happy
and
all
studs
had
to
do
to
get
the
place
the
children
whittled
out
of
the
bottom
of
rivulets
on
a
large
pumpkin
beside
the
teacher
s
chair
was
scratched
a
map
of
the
world
with
the
stein
for
the
north
pole
everything
lucy
lacefield
did
she
did
rapidly
he
needed
she
kept
bricks
to
his
hand
and
recleaned
them
before
she
laid
them
down
in
the
midst
of
this
work
she
had
leisure
womanlike
she
talked
to
toussaint
about
himself
his
life
in
florence
what
he
was
going
to
do
here
on
the
plantation
i
tell
luke
he
ought
to
fertilize
his
cotton
said
the
girl
this
land
s
worn
out
you
mean
manure
it
queried
toussaint
you
could
nt
get
enough
no
i
mean
commercial
fertilizers
toussaint
did
not
know
what
she
was
talking
about
where
do
you
get
that
sort
of
fertilizer
i
do
nt
know
exactly
but
there
is
such
a
thing
i
ve
read
about
it
in
the
farm
papers
i
wonder
if
it
would
make
the
land
grow
much
more
it
says
it
doubles
and
trebles
the
yield
said
lucy
the
girl
s
tone
immediately
made
toussaint
want
to
get
some
of
this
miraculous
stuff
i
could
get
away
within
a
year
hazarded
toussaint
get
away
echoed
lucy
where
are
you
and
your
mother
going
north
i
suppose
returned
the
boy
but
i
had
thought
of
going
west
too
white
people
go
west
said
lucy
looking
at
the
youth
but
colored
folks
hardly
ever
do
ye
es
i
know
that
admitted
toussaint
thinking
of
his
real
purpose
in
fleeing
the
south
at
his
vague
answer
the
girl
looked
at
him
curiously
if
you
made
a
success
here
it
looks
as
if
you
d
stay
well
said
toussaint
drawing
a
long
breath
colored
people
do
nt
get
their
rights
here
my
trouble
with
cady
for
instance
if
he
takes
me
with
a
warrant
i
wo
nt
get
a
fair
show
if
you
make
a
good
tenant
and
grow
lots
of
cotton
you
d
have
a
better
crisply
i
suppose
that
s
so
admitted
toussaint
and
if
you
really
made
a
success
you
d
help
all
the
colored
folks
around
here
persisted
the
tan
colored
girl
rapidly
it
would
show
people
that
negroes
could
be
industrious
and
prosperous
it
s
a
responsibility
to
be
a
colored
person
now
a
white
man
like
cady
can
do
anything
and
nobody
will
think
any
worse
of
white
people
for
it
but
if
a
negro
does
anything
everybody
says
oh
well
all
negroes
are
like
that
i
wish
i
had
nt
thrown
that
paintbrush
at
alex
cady
cried
toussaint
i
ought
to
have
just
let
him
talk
the
girl
came
over
and
touched
his
hand
they
tell
me
what
is
without
help
should
be
without
regard
she
quoted
philosophically
while
the
maxim
was
sober
enough
her
faint
touch
on
his
hand
was
pleasant
to
toussaint
just
then
a
nasal
feminine
voice
called
lucy
lucy
air
you
the
tan
colored
girl
to
step
away
from
toussaint
and
move
to
the
door
where
she
could
see
who
was
calling
her
yes
i
m
here
miss
mamie
she
called
back
toussaint
now
had
the
fireplace
up
as
high
as
his
chest
and
was
trying
to
contrive
how
to
swing
in
the
hips
of
the
little
chimney
a
white
girl
a
trifle
younger
than
lucy
came
walking
across
the
rain
flattened
cotton
rows
oh
you
all
are
makin
a
far
place
she
said
looking
curiously
at
the
rising
structure
yes
the
children
ca
nt
study
in
the
cold
well
i
declare
repeated
the
white
girl
in
astonishment
lucy
had
an
impulse
to
say
miss
cady
this
is
toussaint
vaiden
but
to
have
introduced
a
negro
to
a
white
girl
would
have
been
an
offense
mamie
cady
stood
near
lucy
with
an
occasional
curious
glance
at
the
white
negro
who
was
laying
the
bricks
finally
she
said
lucy
would
you
mind
to
the
colored
girl
the
envelope
was
addressed
in
a
copperplate
handwriting
with
many
flourishes
the
whole
address
was
inscribed
on
a
scroll
above
this
flew
a
pen
drawn
bird
bearing
the
scroll
in
its
beak
on
the
outstretched
wings
of
the
bird
was
written
fly
away
little
bird
and
carry
this
letter
to
on
the
scroll
itself
was
the
address
miss
slatie
cady
beshears
crossroads
lauderdale
county
alabama
lucy
drew
out
a
letter
in
the
same
florid
handwriting
and
looked
at
it
what
does
it
say
asked
mamie
lucy
nodded
faintly
at
toussaint
to
ask
if
mamie
wanted
the
letter
read
before
him
oh
yes
go
ahead
said
mamie

the
white
girl
stood
looking
at
her
letter
for
a
minute
or
so
and
then
said
i
do
nt
reckon
you
could
learn
me
to
write
lucy
why
i
am
sure
i
could
said
lucy
entering
the
pen
and
picking
other
way
while
i
o
my
duty
i
wish
i
d
hit
the
old
one
now
this
is
like
murdering
a
baby
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
forest
eshbaal
was
nee
again
experiencing
surprise
for
suddenly
the
the
strange
noise
frightened
them
soliloquized
eshbaal
perhaps
it
is
a
miracle
the
goats
forpwhich
i
have
searched
all
day
have
been
made
to
return
unto
me
as
they
dashed
past
the
trained
eye
of
the
shepherd
took
note
of
them
there
were
not
many
goats
in
the
bunch
that
had
strayed
so
he
had
no
difficulty
in
counting
them
a
kid
was
missing
being
a
shepherd
there
was
nothing
for
eshbaal
to
do
but
set
forth
in
search
of
the
missing
one
he
advanced
cautiously
alert
because
of
the
noise
that
he
had
heard
eshbaal
was
a
short
stocky
man
with
blue
eyes
and
a
wealth
of
blond
hair
and
beard
his
features
were
regular
and
handsome
in
a
primitive
savage
way
his
single
garment
fashioned
from
a
goat
skin
left
his
right
arm
entirely
free
nor
did
it
impede
his
legs
since
it
fell
not
to
his
knees
he
carried
a
club
and
a
rude
knife
lady
barbara
took
charge
of
the
that
beyond
hard
boiling
eggs
his
knowledge
of
cookingwas
too
sketchy
to
warrant
serious
mention
and
anyway
he
said
we
have
nt
any
eggs
following
the
directions
of
the
english
girl
smith
cut
a
number
of
chops
from
the
carcass
and
these
the
three
grilled
on
pointed
sticks
that
lady
barbara
had
had
him
cut
from
a
nearby
tree
how
long
will
it
take
to
cook
them
demanded
smith
i
could
eat
mine
raw
i
could
eat
the
whole
kid
raw
for
that
matter
in
one
sitting
and
have
room
left
for
the
old
nanny
i
missed
we
ll
eat
only
enough
to
keep
us
going
said
lady
barbara
then
we
ll
wrap
the
rest
in
the
skinpand
take
it
with
us
if
we
re
careful
this
should
keep
us
alive
for
three
or
four
days
of
course
you
re
right
admitted
lafayette
you
always
are
you
can
have
a
because
you
ve
been
longer
without
food
than
we
you
have
had
nothing
for
a
long
time
barbara
said
jezebel
i
am
the
one
who
needs
the
least
we
all
need
it
now
said
lafayette
let
s
have
good
meal
this
time
get
back
our
strength
and
then
ration
the
balance
so
that
it
will
last
several
days
maybe
i
will
sit
on
something
else
before
this
is
gone
they
all
laughed
and
presently
the
chops
were
done
and
the
three
fell
to
upon
them
like
starving
armenians
was
the
simile
smith
suggested
occupied
with
the
delightful
business
of
appeasing
woolfish
hunger
none
of
them
saw
eshbaal
halt
behind
a
tree
and
observe
them
jezebel
he
recognized
for
what
she
was
and
a
sudden
fire
lighted
his
blue
eyes
the
others
were
enigmas
to
him
especially
their
strange
apparel
of
one
thing
eshbaal
was
convinced
he
had
found
his
lost
kid
and
there
was
wrath
in
three
then
he
glided
back
into
the
forest
until
he
was
out
of
their
sight
when
he
broke
into
a
run
the
meal
finished
smith
wrapped
the
remainder
of
he
carcass
in
the
skin
of
the
kid
and
the
three
again
ook
up
their
search
for
the
fissure
an
hour
passed
and
then
another
still
their
efforts
were
not
crowned
with
success
they
saw
nopopening
in
the
stern
forbidding
face
of
the
escarpment
nor
did
they
see
the
slinking
figures
creeping
steadily
nearer
and
nearer
a
score
of
stocky
yellow
haired
men
led
by
eshbaal
the
shepherd
we
must
have
passed
it
said
smith
at
last
it
just
can
not
be
this
far
south
yet
only
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
lay
the
illusive
opening
into
the
great
fissure
we
shall
have
to
hunt
for
some
other
way
out
of
the
valley
then
said
lady
barbara
there
is
a
place
farther
south
that
jezebel
and
i
used
to
see
from
the
mouth
of
our
scaled
let
s
have
a
try
at
it
then
said
smith
say
look
there
he
pointed
toward
the
north
what
is
it
where
demanded
jezebel
i
thought
i
saw
a
man
s
head
behind
that
rock
said
smith
yes
there
he
is
again
lord
look
at
em
they
re
all
around
eshbaal
and
his
fellows
realizing
that
they
were
discovered
came
into
the
open
advancing
slowly
toward
the
three
the
men
of
north
midian
exclaimed
jezebel
are
they
not
beautiful
what
shall
we
do
demanded
lady
barbara
we
must
not
let
them
take
us
we
ll
see
what
they
want
said
smith
they
may
not
be
unfriendly
anyway
we
could
nt
escape
them
by
running
they
would
overtake
us
in
no
time
get
behind
me
and
if
they
show
any
signs
of
attack
ing
i
perhaps
you
had
better
go
out
and
sit
on
them
suggested
lady
barbara
wearily
i
am
sorry
said
smith
that
my
marksmanship
is
so
poor
but
unfortunately
perhaps
it
never
occurredto
my
parents
to
train
me
in
the
gentle
art
of
murder
i
realize
now
that
they
erred
and
that
my
education
has
been
sadly
neglected
i
am
only
a
school
teacher
and
in
teaching
the
young
intellect
to
shoot
i
have
failed
to
learn
to
do
so
myself
i
did
nt
intend
to
be
nasty
said
lady
barbara
who
detected
in
the
irony
of
the
man
s
reply
a
suggestion
of
wounded
pride
please
forgive
me
the
north
midians
were
advancing
cautiously
halting
occasionally
for
brief
whispered
conferences
presently
one
of
them
spoke
addressing
the
three
who
are
you
he
demanded
what
do
you
in
the
land
of
midian
can
you
understand
him
asked
smith
over
his
shoulder
speaks
the
same
language
as
jezebel
s
people
explained
lady
barbara
he
wants
to
know
who
we
are
and
what
we
are
doing
here
you
talk
to
him
lady
barbara
said
smith
the
english
girl
stepped
forward
we
are
strangers
in
midian
she
said
i
ve
never
been
in
a
ve
been
a
shade
more
remote
myself
she
admitted
when
one
s
in
rome
however
i
suppose
one
might
just
as
well
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
i
m
under
the
impression
these
particular
romans
do
nt
said
peter
the
doctor
seemed
very
snooty
do
nt
what
she
asked
you
re
always
so
damn
blunt
he
complained
i
mean
they
do
nt
make
hay
then
they
do
nt
sound
like
romans
to
me
said
the
girl
those
old
devils
were
always
making
hay
you
carry
logic
to
the
point
of
depravity
he
objected
i
do
nt
understand
said
jo
well
he
began
with
an
effort
i
do
nt
quite
understandmyself
but
it
s
like
this
logically
speaking
this
situationcalls
for
a
certain
line
of
conduct
whereas
almost
demands
it
said
jo
do
nt
interrupt
you
d
get
the
hell
out
of
here
and
go
back
to
your
own
bed
but
morally
speaking
suppose
i
was
nt
a
lady
she
asked
then
naturally
we
could
nt
continue
to
speak
morally
he
replied
i
m
glad
of
that
said
jo
running
her
fingers
through
his
hair
do
nt
do
that
he
told
her
do
nt
make
the
slightest
move
should
nt
i
do
this
she
asked
a
white
arm
slipping
snakelike
round
his
neck
no
he
replied
not
that
nor
anything
like
it
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
do
nt
i
have
nt
a
damn
thing
to
give
gloomed
peter
they
did
nt
even
leave
me
a
check
book
if
they
had
i
d
tear
out
the
checks
and
rig
up
a
girdle
for
myself
you
d
look
sweet
said
jo
might
but
i
d
feel
a
lot
less
public
you
know
those
women
jo
asked
in
a
conversational
voice
no
peter
replied
i
do
nt
what
women
those
women
jo
went
on
who
claim
that
if
their
husbands
came
home
unexpectedly
and
found
them
in
bed
with
some
man
the
husbands
would
show
how
evil
minded
they
were
if
they
thought
anything
wrong
about
it
do
you
know
those
women
peter
there
may
be
longer
and
less
ably
stated
hypothetical
questions
replied
peter
but
i
never
answered
one
no
i
do
nt
know
those
women
thank
god
well
what
i
was
trying
to
say
she
continued
her
arm
tightening
round
his
neck
is
that
i
m
not
at
all
like
those
women
and
if
i
happened
to
be
your
husband
said
peter
i
would
nt
believe
you
if
you
were
then
that
may
i
ask
what
all
this
is
leading
up
to
asked
peter
to
this
said
jo
she
kissed
the
man
and
forgot
to
stop
pin
pursuit
of
privacy
you
have
the
most
evil
looking
head
of
red
hair
i
ever
saw
peter
vouchsafed
lazily
some
time
later
just
like
some
of
the
smaller
flames
of
hell
or
those
snake
like
locks
of
medusa
and
your
face
is
baleful
too
in
a
beautiful
sort
of
way
he
was
lying
on
his
right
side
critically
surveying
the
girl
s
face
touching
it
here
and
there
with
an
inquiring
fingertip
i
do
nt
know
how
i
can
lie
here
in
bed
and
look
at
yours
she
told
him
with
a
small
companionable
yawn
god
must
have
run
out
of
color
or
lost
interest
when
he
came
to
your
hair
and
eyes
you
re
merely
tinted
to
me
you
are
singularly
rabbit
like
in
what
sense
may
i
ask
in
appearance
she
said
coffee
world
now
no
he
replied
i
have
no
such
exalted
aspirations
i
am
merely
a
man
who
will
stand
for
so
much
and
no
more
it
s
too
bad
you
re
not
the
kind
who
will
go
just
so
far
and
no
further
jo
retorted
one
can
hardly
do
that
with
you
he
said
easily
you
d
drag
them
the
rest
of
the
way
oh
so
i
m
the
responsible
party
she
observed
gouging
him
in
the
cheek
while
you
you
poor
dear
are
the
wronged
one
exactly
was
the
complacent
reply
i
look
upon
myself
thank
god
in
the
most
detached
light
only
in
a
remote
way
like
an
extra
on
a
crowded
stage
am
i
connected
with
the
drama
of
your
inevitable
downfall
i
do
nt
like
that
crowded
stage
crack
the
girl
replied
sombrely
you
were
the
first
player
stuff
do
nt
confuse
life
with
fiction
there
re
more
ruined
women
in
the
world
today
eating
three
square
meals
with
an
easy
conscience
than
there
are
homes
for
wayward
girls
you
re
hard
said
pete
no
i
m
not
she
retorted
i
m
reasonable
and
i
m
notat
all
unromantic
for
instance
i
think
it
s
quite
beautiful
being
here
with
you
like
this
wo
nt
forget
it
for
some
time
when
you
feel
that
you
re
beginning
to
just
drop
round
when
you
re
not
busy
and
i
ll
try
to
refresh
your
memory
said
peter
you
see
asserted
jo
triumphantly
you
re
really
the
hard
boiled
member
of
this
team
men
usually
pretend
to
make
quite
a
fuss
over
the
women
they
ve
ruined
you
strike
me
as
being
a
little
proud
a
little
strutty
i
confess
i
do
nt
know
he
admitted
no
man
ever
attempted
to
ruin
me
of
a
slight
feeling
of
elation
as
much
as
i
hate
to
take
the
wind
out
of
your
sails
she
said
in
justice
to
myself
i
must
remind
you
that
far
from
being
your
victim
you
re
jolly
well
mine
stuff
and
nonsense
scoffed
peter
you
re
merely
a
butterfly
on
the
wheel
crushed
and
broken
another
conquest
no
more
and
no
less
you
ll
be
crushed
and
broken
you
little
coffee
bean
she
retorted
hotly
if
you
do
nt
watch
your
step
i
ruined
you
my
lad
you
did
nt
ruin
me
it
hardly
seems
sensible
to
be
lying
here
disputing
over
which
of
us
ruined
the
other
he
remarked
it
s
a
highly
technical
question
my
eye
it
is
exclaimed
jo
you
re
comes
byron
talks
in
a
flat
level
voice
it
was
a
strange
place
where
a
man
would
be
where
the
chance
to
do
harm
could
not
have
found
him
it
would
have
been
out
there
at
the
mill
on
a
saturday
evening
and
with
the
house
burning
too
right
in
my
face
you
might
say
it
was
like
all
the
time
i
was
eating
dinner
and
i
would
look
up
now
and
then
and
see
that
smoke
and
i
would
think
well
i
wont
see
a
soul
out
here
this
evening
anyway
i
ai
nt
going
to
be
interrupted
this
evening
at
least
and
then
i
looked
up
and
there
she
was
with
her
face
all
fixed
for
smiling
and
with
her
mouth
all
fixed
to
say
his
name
when
she
saw
that
i
was
nt
him
and
i
never
knowed
any
better
than
to
blab
the
whole
thing
he
grimaces
faintly
it
is
not
a
smile
his
upper
lip
just
lifts
momentarily
the
movement
even
the
surface
wrinkling
travelling
no
further
and
vanishing
almost
at
once
i
was
not
the
worst
of
it
it
must
have
been
a
strange
thing
that
could
keep
byron
bunch
in
jefferson
over
sunday
hightower
says
but
she
was
looking
for
him
and
you
helped
her
to
find
him
was
nt
what
you
did
what
she
wanted
what
she
had
come
all
the
way
from
alabama
to
find
i
reckon
i
told
her
all
right
i
reckon
it
ai
nt
any
question
about
that
with
her
watching
me
sitting
there
swolebellied
watching
me
with
them
eyes
that
a
man
could
not
have
lied
to
if
he
had
wanted
and
me
blabbing
on
with
that
smoke
right
yonder
in
plain
sight
like
it
was
put
there
to
warn
me
to
make
me
watch
my
mouth
only
i
never
had
the
sense
to
see
it
oh
hightower
says
the
house
that
burned
yesterday
but
i
do
nt
see
any
connection
between
whose
house
was
it
i
saw
the
smoke
myself
and
know
that
old
burden
house
byron
says
he
looks
at
the
other
they
look
at
one
another
hightower
is
a
tall
man
and
he
was
thin
once
but
he
is
not
thin
now
his
skin
is
the
color
of
flour
sacking
and
his
upper
body
in
shape
is
like
a
loosely
filled
sack
falling
from
his
gaunt
shoulders
of
its
own
weight
upon
his
lap
then
byron
says
you
ai
nt
heard
yet
the
other
watches
him
he
says
in
a
musing
tone
that
would
be
for
me
to
do
too
to
tell
on
two
days
to
two
folks
something
they
ai
nt
going
to
want
to
hear
and
that
they
had
nt
ought
to
have
to
hear
at
all
what
is
this
that
you
think
i
will
not
want
to
hear
what
is
it
that
i
have
not
heard
not
the
fire
byron
says
they
got
out
of
the
fire
all
right
they
again
byron
looks
at
the
other
for
a
moment
but
hightower
s
face
is
merely
grave
and
interested
brown
and
christmas
byron
says
still
hightower
s
face
does
not
change
in
expression
you
ai
nt
heard
that
even
byron
says
they
lived
out
there
lived
out
there
they
boarded
in
the
house
no
in
a
old
nigger
cabin
in
the
back
christmas
fixed
it
up
three
years
ago
he
s
been
living
in
it
ever
since
with
folks
wondering
where
he
slept
at
night
then
when
him
and
brown
set
up
together
he
took
brown
in
with
him
oh
hightower
said
but
i
do
nt
see
if
they
were
comfortable
and
miss
burden
did
nt
i
reckon
they
got
along
they
were
selling
whiskey
using
that
old
place
for
a
headquarters
a
blind
i
do
nt
reckon
she
knew
that
about
the
whiskey
leastways
they
say
that
christmas
started
it
by
himself
three
years
ago
just
selling
to
a
few
regular
customers
that
did
nt
even
know
one
another
but
when
he
took
brown
in
with
him
i
reckon
brown
wanted
to
spread
out
selling
it
by
the
half
a
pint
out
of
his
shirt
bosom
in
any
alley
and
to
anybody
selling
what
he
never
drunk
that
is
and
i
reckon
the
way
they
got
the
whiskey
they
sold
would
not
have
stood
much
looking
into
because
about
two
weeks
after
brown
quit
out
at
the
mill
and
taken
to
riding
around
in
that
new
car
for
his
steady
work
he
was
down
town
drunk
one
saturday
night
and
bragging
to
a
crowd
in
the
barbershop
something
about
him
and
christmas
in
memphis
one
night
or
on
a
road
close
to
memphis
something
about
them
and
that
new
car
hid
in
the
bushes
and
christmas
with
a
pistol
and
a
lot
more
about
a
truck
and
a
hundred
gallons
of
something
until
christmas
come
in
quick
and
walked
up
and
christmas
saying
in
that
quiet
voice
of
his
that
ai
nt
pleasant
and
ai
nt
mad
either
you
ought
to
be
careful
about
drinking
so
much
of
this
jefferson
hair
tonic
it
s
gone
to
your
head
first
thing
you
know
you
ll
have
a
hairlip
holding
brown
up
he
was
with
one
hand
and
slapping
his
face
with
the
other
they
did
nt
look
like
hard
licks
but
the
folks
could
see
the
red
even
through
brown
s
whiskers
when
christmas
hand
would
come
away
between
licks
you
come
out
and
get
some
fresh
air
christmas
says
you
re
keeping
these
folks
from
working
he
muses
he
speaks
again
and
there
she
was
siting
there
on
them
staves
watching
me
and
me
blabbing
the
whole
thing
to
her
and
her
watching
me
and
then
she
says
did
he
have
a
little
white
scar
right
here
by
his
mouth
and
brown
is
the
man
hightower
says
he
sits
motionless
there
is
nothing
militant
in
it
nothing
of
outraged
morality
it
is
as
though
he
were
listening
to
the
doings
of
people
of
a
different
race
her
husband
a
bootlegger
well
russian
circle
gathered
about
once
a
week
and
though
john
had
been
invited
many
times
he
never
found
the
time
or
the
courage
to
go
and
sit
among
those
tragic
figures
over
whose
intellectual
revels
nina
presided
with
the
simplicity
and
grace
of
an
exiled
queen
he
had
echoes
of
their
discussions
and
noticed
an
occasional
fatuity
straight
out
of
madame
blavatsky
but
he
reflected
that
the
background
of
a
man
s
history
is
what
colors
his
allusions
and
he
wondered
how
his
heritage
of
lord
cornwallis
in
a
red
coat
cooper
s
indians
kit
carson
emerson
s
faded
posies
whitman
s
urgings
and
bryan
s
philippics
impressed
those
foreigners
and
though
he
was
an
american
his
immediate
ancestors
were
german
and
irish
his
childhood
surroundings
of
a
cosmopolitan
air
helped
him
to
understand
the
russians
or
at
least
sympathize
with
them
his
prussian
grandfather
a
rotund
and
at
the
same
time
chic
personage
insisted
that
john
as
a
child
greet
him
in
three
languages
every
time
they
it
were
a
piece
of
etiquette
after
which
commonplaces
could
be
taken
up
there
was
a
professor
of
physics
at
the
university
whom
nina
liked
and
whom
john
liked
because
he
resembled
this
grandparent
at
one
of
the
parties
of
that
time
she
and
he
had
gone
off
into
a
discussion
of
a
molecular
conception
of
the
deity
which
nina
enlivened
with
proofs
derived
from
a
human
experience
with
fate
was
god
for
reason
zat
scientists
admit
control
of
universe
by
some
force
ach
so
said
the
professor
fondling
his
beard
aber
this
force
is
not
necessarily
god
madame
so
you
call
it
one
thing
i
another
is
same
thing
god
replied
nina
with
one
of
her
saddest
and
most
convincing
smiles
there
was
no
refutation
for
that
sort
of
argument
and
the
professor
nodded
profoundly
allowing
nina
to
lean
back
among
her
cushions
with
an
honest
sense
of
victory
george
the
world
of
me
and
believe
me
in
my
life
we
have
a
great
chance
there
he
said
seriously
for
a
great
work
we
re
educating
the
public
to
good
music
why
every
new
score
i
arrange
i
slip
in
first
rate
stuff
and
the
public
s
none
the
wiser
he
sat
back
with
an
effect
of
triumph
he
talked
on
for
half
an
hour
painting
a
gorgeous
picture
of
the
tremendous
advance
he
had
made
spiritually
he
said
that
the
movies
were
the
widest
expression
of
contemporary
america
what
a
grand
thing
it
was
to
be
in
it
what
a
chance
to
develop
art
along
with
the
machine
age
where
he
had
read
this
mechanistic
philosophy
john
could
guess
all
the
magazines
were
full
of
it
and
doore
said
the
monitor
had
a
page
devoted
to
serious
discussion
of
movies
and
their
problems
he
touched
john
deeply
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
been
wrong
about
him
how
could
he
have
taken
doore
s
earnest
enthusiasm
his
childlike
simplicity
for
anything
like
prodded
him
along
with
questions
feeling
guilty
for
his
old
hatred
and
trying
by
stimulating
helps
to
rebuild
doore
s
personality
in
the
direction
he
adored
they
got
up
presently
and
left
the
restaurant
and
started
to
walk
home
along
the
quieting
main
street
with
its
electric
signs
winking
and
announcing
in
a
still
sky
for
the
benefit
of
an
empty
street
the
corner
arc
lamps
burned
and
enflamed
street
cars
and
late
taxicabs
it
was
near
midnight
a
good
hour
john
reflected
for
conversation
as
they
walked
doore
returned
to
the
swami
i
hope
nina
was
there
he
said
was
she
there
john
said
remembering
how
he
had
watched
her
during
the
two
hours
of
the
lecture
was
she
i
ll
have
fun
talking
it
over
with
her
tomorrow
you
know
i
see
lots
of
her
nowadays
doore
said
with
a
wink
i
know
she
has
told
me
is
she
sweet
well
kid
i
m
telling
you
he
leered
around
at
john
s
face
she
s
got
everything
john
stopped
and
stared
at
him
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
he
said
furiously
now
listen
doore
said
putting
his
hand
on
john
s
arm
placatingly
do
nt
get
jealous
jack
john
felt
strangled
you
son
of
a
bitch
he
said
loudly
and
pushed
george
into
the
gutter
george
stared
with
amazement
and
then
john
began
walking
rapidly
cursing
him
in
his
heart
and
griped
to
his
belly
by
the
fact
that
he
had
been
decent
to
doore
as
shortly
ago
as
ten
minutes
doore
ran
after
him
crouching
and
laughing
nervously
through
his
words
listen
i
did
nt
mean
get
the
hell
away
from
me
john
said
walking
on
doore
paused
and
laughed
and
cleared
his
nose
several
times
inwardly
noisily
and
then
his
eyes
wishing
that
he
had
hit
doore
and
that
doore
had
hit
him
john
took
his
way
homeward
to
mrs
bliss
s
what
to
do
should
he
tell
nina
or
tell
val
or
tell
blanche
and
let
it
simmer
through
to
them
less
painfully
had
doore
been
talking
generally
where
had
julia
heard
the
scandal
she
had
referred
to
weeks
ago
at
the
club
were
people
gossiping
what
did
mr
ganson
say
only
today
i
ve
been
told
you
are
with
her
a
very
great
deal
some
people
find
this
shocking
good
god
was
nina
safe
from
no
tongue
john
railed
against
the
standards
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
champion
her
person
and
her
name
he
was
very
tired
when
he
got
home
when
his
key
scratched
in
the
door
mrs
bliss
flung
it
open
and
deposited
her
head
upon
his
bosom
a
wet
handkerchief
to
her
swollen
nose
and
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
in
her
stricken
eyes
oh
what
is
the
matter
she
drew
him
into
his
bedroom
where
she
had
the
light
on
and
sat
with
him
on
his
bed
heaving
with
terrible
sobs
rubbing
the
swelling
of
headache
and
grief
on
her
brow
it
s
martin
her
son
but
her
air
of
mystery
finally
resolved
itself
as
in
his
bed
he
had
gambled
away
a
great
sum
ai
yah
fortune
had
not
attended
him
the
entirety
of
his
master
s
increase
must
fall
into
his
hands
if
he
were
to
pay
his
debts
the
number
two
houseboy
must
be
hired
and
the
extra
coolie
so
he
could
receive
part
of
their
wages
from
everything
that
came
into
the
house
he
must
take
an
extra
commission
and
missie
must
buy
more
how
could
he
teach
her
to
want
more
in
this
he
had
not
yet
succeeded
when
he
tried
to
embroideries
the
little
trinkets
the
laces
the
bronzes
she
bought
sparingly
as
a
man
would
buy
the
little
heat
was
passed
the
great
heat
drew
on
toward
its
fulness
day
after
day
no
rain
fell
and
the
second
rice
began
to
turn
yellow
before
its
time
the
water
that
had
been
garnered
in
reservoirs
was
fed
to
the
fields
and
along
the
streams
and
the
river
all
night
the
feet
of
men
walked
the
endless
treads
of
the
chain
pumps
then
except
along
the
river
the
foot
pumps
were
still
for
there
was
no
more
water
in
reservoir
or
stream
in
the
city
there
came
a
time
when
the
water
taken
from
the
wells
was
thin
mud
each
day
the
line
of
water
carriers
at
the
river
grew
longer
in
a
lengthening
queue
they
moved
over
the
river
bank
a
thin
yellow
band
in
the
distance
the
farmers
idle
now
moved
along
the
alley
like
streets
of
the
city
along
the
bund
crowding
the
sampans
across
the
river
they
would
petition
their
gods
for
rain
what
did
the
gods
want
reverence
three
steps
and
we
kneel
sacrifice
hooks
hung
in
our
flesh
that
the
gods
may
see
and
give
us
a
little
rain
in
order
that
our
sons
may
live
no
meat
or
fowls
or
eggs
sold
in
the
city
no
life
of
any
kind
taken
except
for
the
sacrifice
of
bull
and
ram
made
by
the
governor
stephen
walking
daily
through
the
city
watched
the
money
market
grow
tight
the
price
of
rice
go
up
in
many
small
shops
men
sat
idle
it
startled
him
to
see
how
small
was
the
margin
on
which
the
people
of
the
valley
bought
how
quickly
it
was
wiped
out
in
his
offices
although
they
had
wages
and
would
not
starve
clerk
junkman
and
coolie
squeezed
as
they
had
never
squeezed
before
they
seemed
to
partake
of
the
common
fear
stephen
forgot
the
delight
of
his
intellectual
adventure
in
exploring
the
chinese
mind
forgot
his
was
unconsciously
one
with
those
around
him
some
instinct
within
him
vibrating
to
the
fundamental
calamity
when
he
found
the
office
coolie
palming
stamps
from
letters
he
did
not
dismiss
him
as
he
would
have
done
a
month
ago
and
although
he
watched
now
more
closely
than
ever
to
keep
down
the
squeeze
it
was
in
a
new
mood
not
with
the
censoriousness
of
an
outsider
but
with
the
sympathy
he
would
have
felt
looking
upon
a
like
manifestation
among
his
own
people
stephen
tried
to
keep
from
hester
that
there
was
danger
of
famine
high
at
the
top
of
the
hong
sheltered
secluded
she
failed
to
understand
the
full
significance
of
the
drought
she
saw
only
a
gay
pageant
moving
across
the
bund
peasants
with
yellow
knapsacks
bound
for
the
temples
the
gods
decked
in
bright
red
robes
riding
in
chairs
on
the
shoulders
of
men
who
carried
them
out
to
view
the
metallic
sky
the
bright
sterile
clouds
finding
delight
in
sound
and
movement
she
grew
excited
over
the
spectacle
activity
she
knew
not
what
and
when
kin
came
saying
a
white
pedlar
stood
outside
with
a
bundle
greatly
big
she
welcomed
the
diversion
it
was
a
russian
tall
and
gaunt
who
entered
at
kin
s
bidding
kneeling
by
his
pack
he
took
from
it
rugs
glowing
in
color
soft
as
silk
hester
coveting
the
most
beautiful
of
the
rugs
began
bargaining
seeing
in
the
man
s
eagerness
the
desire
to
sell
at
any
price
she
had
just
completed
her
bargain
when
stephen
came
at
her
summons
to
pay
the
man
he
looked
at
hester
vivid
with
the
excitement
of
possession
bright
spots
in
her
cheeks
he
heard
the
sounds
coming
up
from
the
bund
bang
bang
men
beating
upon
brass
gongs
a
frenzy
of
gongs
propitiation
of
the
gods
the
heavens
he
knew
not
which
but
he
knew
that
it
was
desperate
entreaty
to
end
the
drought
famine
at
the
doors
and
hester
buying
a
costly
rug
hong
s
full
of
company
rugs
but
they
re
so
ugly
stephen
look
at
this
one
on
the
floor
it
s
got
two
darns
in
it
the
new
one
would
look
lovely
in
this
room
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
soft
surface
of
the
rug
we
ca
nt
hester
why
not
she
demanded
feeling
resentment
over
his
unwillingness
remembering
his
substantial
increase
because
there
s
famine
the
pent
up
strain
under
which
stephen
had
been
laboring
broke
its
bounds
when
there
s
famine
the
people
ca
nt
buy
this
is
my
first
managership
i
have
nt
made
good
yet
my
whole
future
is
built
on
sales
i
do
nt
know
yet
how
bad
the
famine
will
be
how
far
it
s
going
to
spread
maybe
over
the
whole
province
suppose
the
sales
drop
instead
of
increasing
the
company
sees
no
extenuating
circumstances
either
i
win
or
i
lose
suppose
i
lose
hester
sat
back
on
her
heels
but
i
did
nt
know
stephen
he
was
angry
with
himself
he
had
not
wanted
to
shatter
hester
s
sense
of
security
it
was
for
that
he
was
working
better
buy
the
rug
i
guess
we
can
swing
it
he
added
hastily
we
have
nt
famine
yet
i
m
probably
borrowing
trouble
hester
looked
at
stephen
as
he
counted
out
the
money
but
her
pleasure
in
her
purchase
was
gone
famine
looked
out
at
her
she
remembered
the
trek
of
the
peasants
in
manchuria
their
faces
that
was
wanted
the
bell
within
reach
she
had
the
feeling
well
known
to
her
of
settling
herself
in
the
saddle
for
a
formidable
jump
he
sha
nt
touch
me
anyway
she
thought
she
heard
blore
s
voice
say
sir
gerald
corven
my
lady
quaint
announcing
a
husband
to
his
wife
but
staff
knew
everything
without
looking
she
saw
perfectly
well
where
he
was
standing
a
surge
of
shamed
anger
stained
her
cheeks
he
had
fascinated
her
he
had
used
her
as
every
kind
of
plaything
he
had
one
more
river
his
voice
cuttingly
controlled
said
well
my
dear
you
were
very
sudden
neat
and
trim
as
ever
and
those
daring
despoiling
eyes
what
do
you
want
only
yourself
you
ca
nt
have
me
absurd
he
made
the
quickest
kind
of
movement
and
seized
her
in
his
arms
clare
bent
her
head
back
and
put
her
finger
on
the
bell
move
back
or
i
ring
and
she
put
her
other
hand
between
his
face
and
hers
stand
over
there
and
i
ll
talk
to
you
otherwise
you
must
go
very
well
but
it
s
ridiculous
oh
do
you
think
i
should
have
gone
if
i
had
nt
been
in
earnest
i
thought
you
were
just
riled
and
i
do
nt
wonder
i
m
sorry
it
s
no
good
discussing
what
happened
i
know
you
and
i
m
not
coming
back
to
you
my
dear
you
have
my
apology
and
i
give
you
my
word
against
anything
of
the
sort
again
how
experiment
some
women
adore
it
if
not
at
the
time
you
are
a
beast
and
beauty
married
me
come
clare
do
nt
be
silly
and
make
us
a
laughing
stock
you
can
fix
your
own
conditions
and
trust
you
to
keep
them
besides
that
s
not
my
idea
of
a
life
i
m
only
twenty
four
one
more
river
the
smile
left
his
lips
i
see
i
noticed
a
young
man
come
out
of
this
house
name
and
estate
tony
croom
well
he
walked
over
to
the
window
and
after
a
moment
s
contemplation
of
the
street
turned
and
said
you
have
the
misfortune
to
he
my
wife
so
i
was
thinking
quite
seriously
clare
come
back
to
me
quite
seriously
no
i
have
an
official
position
and
i
ca
nt
play
about
with
it
look
at
me
he
me
but
i
m
neither
a
humbug
nor
old
fashioned
i
do
nt
trade
on
my
position
or
on
the
sanctity
of
marriage
or
any
of
that
stuff
but
they
still
pay
attention
to
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
service
and
i
ca
nt
afford
to
let
you
divorce
me
i
did
nt
expect
it
what
then
i
know
nothing
except
that
i
m
not
coming
back
just
because
of
and
a
great
deal
else
the
cat
like
smile
had
come
back
and
prevented
her
from
reading
what
he
was
thinking
do
you
want
me
to
divorce
you
clare
shrugged
you
have
no
reason
so
you
would
naturally
say
and
mean
now
look
here
clare
this
is
all
absurd
and
quite
unworthy
of
any
one
with
your
sense
and
knowledge
of
things
you
ca
nt
be
a
perpetual
grass
widow
you
did
nt
dislike
the
life
out
there
things
that
ca
nt
be
done
to
me
and
you
have
done
them
i
ve
said
that
they
sha
nt
be
done
again
and
i
ve
said
that
i
ca
nt
trust
you
this
is
going
round
the
mulberry
bush
are
you
going
to
live
on
your
people
no
i
ve
got
a
job
oh
what
secretary
to
our
new
member
you
ll
be
sick
of
that
in
no
time
i
do
nt
think
so
he
stood
staring
at
her
without
his
smile
for
a
moment
she
could
read
his
thoughts
for
his
face
had
the
expression
which
preludes
sex
suddenly
he
said
i
wo
nt
stand
for
another
man
having
you
it
was
a
comfort
to
have
seen
for
once
the
bottom
of
his
mind
she
did
not
answer
did
you
hear
me
yes
i
meant
it
i
could
see
that
i
wish
i
had
been
he
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
and
came
to
a
stand
dead
in
front
of
her
look
at
me
i
m
not
going
back
without
you
i
m
staying
at
the
bristol
be
sensible
there
s
a
darling
and
come
to
me
there
we
ll
start
again
i
ll
be
ever
so
nice
to
you
her
control
gave
way
and
she
cried
out
oh
for
god
s
sake
understand
you
killed
all
the
feeling
i
had
for
you
o
one
more
river
his
eyes
dilated
and
then
narrowed
his
lips
became
a
line
he
looked
like
a
horse
breaker
and
understand
me
he
said
very
low
you
either
come
back
to
me
or
i
divorce
you
i
wo
nt
leave
ou
here
to
kick
your
heels
i
m
sure
you
ll
have
the
approval
of
every
judicious
husband
the
smile
reappeared
on
his
lips
for
to
have
a
kiss
and
before
she
could
stop
him
he
had
fastened
his
lips
on
hers
she
tore
herself
away
and
pressed
the
bell
he
went
quickly
to
the
door
flu
revoir
he
said
and
went
out
clare
wiped
her
lips
she
felt
bewildered
and
exhausted
and
quite
ignorant
whether
to
him
or
to
her
the
day
had
gone
she
stood
leaning
her
forehead
on
her
hands
over
the
fire
and
became
aware
that
sir
lawrence
had
come
back
and
was
considerately
saying
nothing
awfully
sorry
uncle
i
shall
he
in
my
digs
next
week
have
a
cigarette
my
dear
clare
took
the
cigarette
and
inhaled
its
comfort
her
uncle
had
seated
himself
and
she
was
conscious
of
the
quizzical
expression
of
his
eyebrows
conference
had
its
usual
success
clare
nodded
the
elusive
formula
the
fact
is
human
beings
are
never
satisfied
with
what
they
do
nt
want
however
cleverly
it
s
put
is
it
so
far
as
i
m
concerned
pity
there
are
always
two
parties
for
writing
the
pamphlets
that
is
to
say
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
a
free
fuck
in
one
of
the
egyptian
rooms
if
i
succeeded
in
bringing
a
client
i
was
to
get
my
commission
just
like
kepi
got
his
in
the
old
days
one
night
i
brought
van
norden
he
was
going
to
let
me
earn
a
little
money
by
enjoying
himself
upstairs
but
when
the
madame
learned
that
he
was
a
newspaperman
she
would
nt
hear
of
champagne
again
and
a
free
fuck
i
got
nothing
out
of
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
to
write
the
story
for
him
because
he
could
nt
think
how
to
get
round
the
subject
without
mentioning
the
kind
of
place
it
was
one
thing
after
another
like
that
i
was
getting
fucked
good
and
proper
the
worst
job
of
all
was
a
thesis
i
undertook
to
write
for
a
deaf
and
dumb
psychologist
a
treatise
on
the
care
of
crippled
children
my
head
was
full
of
diseases
and
braces
and
workbenches
and
fresh
air
theories
it
took
about
six
weeks
off
and
on
and
then
to
rub
it
in
i
had
to
proofread
the
goddamned
thing
it
was
in
french
such
a
french
as
i
ve
never
in
my
life
seen
or
heard
but
it
brought
me
in
a
good
breakfast
every
day
an
american
breakfast
with
orange
juice
oatmeal
cream
coffee
now
and
then
ham
and
eggs
for
a
change
it
was
the
only
period
decent
breakfast
thanks
to
the
crippled
children
of
rockaway
beach
the
east
side
and
all
the
coves
and
inlets
bordering
on
these
sore
points
then
one
day
i
fell
in
with
a
photographer
he
was
making
a
collection
of
the
slimy
joints
of
paris
for
some
degenerate
in
munich
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
would
pose
for
him
with
my
pants
down
and
in
other
ways
i
thought
of
those
skinny
little
runts
who
look
like
bellhops
and
messenger
boys
that
one
sees
on
pornographic
post
cards
in
little
bookshop
windows
occasionally
the
mysterious
phantoms
who
inhabit
the
rue
de
la
lune
and
other
malodorous
quarters
of
the
city
i
did
nt
like
very
much
the
idea
of
advertising
my
physiog
in
the
company
of
these
elite
but
since
i
was
assured
that
the
photographs
were
for
a
strictly
private
collection
and
since
it
was
destined
for
munich
i
gave
my
consent
when
you
re
not
in
your
home
town
you
can
permit
yourself
little
liberties
particularly
for
such
a
worthy
motive
as
earning
your
so
squeamish
come
to
think
of
it
even
in
new
york
there
were
nights
when
i
was
so
damned
desperate
back
there
that
i
had
to
go
out
right
in
my
own
neighborhood
and
panhandle
we
did
nt
go
to
the
show
places
familiar
to
the
tourists
but
to
the
little
joints
where
the
atmosphere
was
more
congenial
where
we
could
play
a
game
of
cards
in
the
afternoon
before
getting
down
to
work
he
was
a
good
companion
the
photographer
he
knew
the
city
inside
out
the
walls
particularly
he
talked
to
me
about
goethe
often
and
the
days
of
the
hohenstaufen
and
the
massacre
of
the
jews
during
the
reign
of
the
black
death
interesting
subjects
and
always
related
in
some
obscure
way
to
the
things
he
was
doing
he
had
ideas
for
scenarios
too
astounding
ideas
but
nobody
had
the
courage
to
execute
them
the
sight
of
a
horse
split
open
like
a
saloon
door
would
inspire
him
to
talk
of
dante
or
leonardo
da
vinci
or
jump
into
a
cab
and
rush
me
to
the
trocadero
museum
in
order
to
point
out
a
skull
or
a
mummy
that
had
fascinated
him
we
explored
the
th
the
th
the
th
and
the
th
arrondissements
thoroughly
our
favorite
resting
places
were
lugubrious
little
spots
such
as
the
place
nationale
place
des
peupliers
place
de
la
contrescarpe
place
paul
verlaine
many
of
these
places
were
already
familiar
to
mc
but
all
of
them
i
now
saw
in
a
different
light
owing
to
the
rare
flavor
of
his
conversation
if
today
i
should
happen
to
stroll
down
the
rue
du
chateau
des
rentiers
for
example
inhaling
the
fetid
stench
of
the
hospital
beds
with
which
the
th
arrondissementreeks
my
nostrils
would
undoubtedly
expand
with
pleasure
because
compounded
with
that
odor
of
stale
piss
and
formaldehyde
there
would
be
the
odors
of
our
imaginative
voyages
through
the
charnel
house
of
europe
which
the
black
death
had
created
through
him
i
got
to
know
a
spiritual
minded
individual
named
kruger
who
was
a
sculptor
and
painter
kruger
took
a
shine
impossible
to
get
away
from
him
once
he
discovered
that
i
was
willing
to
listen
to
his
esoteric
ideas
there
are
people
in
this
world
for
whom
the
word
esoteric
seems
to
act
as
a
divine
ichor
like
settled
for
herr
peeperkorn
of
the
magic
mountain
kruger
was
one
of
those
saints
who
have
gone
wrong
a
masochist
an
anal
type
whose
law
is
scrupulousness
rectitude
and
conscientiousness
who
on
an
off
day
would
knock
a
man
s
teeth
down
his
throat
without
a
qualm
he
seemed
to
think
i
was
ripe
to
move
on
to
another
plane
a
higher
plane
as
he
put
it
i
was
ready
to
move
on
to
any
plane
he
designated
provided
that
one
did
nt
eat
less
or
drink
less
he
chewed
my
head
off
about
the
threadsoul
the
causal
body
ablation
the
upanishads
plotinus
krishnamurti
the
karmic
vestiture
of
the
soul
the
nirvanic
consciousness
all
that
flapdoodle
which
plague
sometimes
he
would
go
into
a
trance
and
talk
about
his
previous
incarnations
how
he
imagined
them
to
be
at
least
or
he
would
relate
his
dreams
which
so
far
as
i
could
see
were
thoroughly
insipid
prosaic
hardly
worth
even
the
attention
of
a
freudian
but
for
him
there
were
vast
esoteric
marvels
hidden
in
their
depths
which
i
had
to
aid
him
to
decipher
he
had
turned
himself
inside
out
like
mercy
and
not
casting
the
first
stone
it
s
a
mistake
it
s
doing
to
others
what
you
hope
they
will
do
to
you
if
at
any
time
you
decide
to
take
there
are
no
duties
no
standards
no
responsibilities
left
i
think
that
we
were
better
off
when
a
man
was
expected
to
do
right
and
people
were
shocked
if
he
did
nt
today
a
man
seems
to
be
expected
to
do
wrong
and
it
s
considered
rather
ingenuous
to
be
shocked
well
i
do
nt
know
about
all
that
eric
cadbury
said
but
it
sounds
good
it
seems
to
me
the
case
is
whether
doc
bull
ought
to
be
allowed
to
get
away
with
taking
his
salary
and
not
doing
his
job
i
do
nt
know
who
expects
what
but
unless
you
re
a
tammany
democrat
in
new
york
city
i
guess
you
more
or
less
expect
to
be
out
of
a
job
if
they
catch
you
not
doing
it
in
any
big
way
i
think
you
ll
find
the
ayes
have
it
herbert
matthew
herring
said
now
as
you
say
there
s
a
good
chance
that
we
ca
nt
successfully
indict
way
what
can
we
do
about
persuading
the
county
health
officer
to
remove
him
eric
cadbury
his
eyes
puckered
up
shrewdly
said
hold
on
that
s
the
wrong
end
of
the
stick
if
you
want
to
get
at
him
you
d
better
get
at
the
eighteen
hundred
a
year
the
school
committee
pays
him
to
be
medical
examiner
we
ll
get
at
that
matthew
herring
said
it
so
happens
that
he
has
a
certain
support
on
the
school
commit
tee
i
do
nt
plan
to
treat
with
it
because
it
would
simply
boil
down
to
some
sort
of
political
deal
with
the
democrats
as
long
as
mr
harris
controls
the
democratic
policies
any
decent
or
honest
relationship
is
obviously
impossible
i
want
to
get
at
it
another
way
go
on
matthew
said
mr
banning
i
m
not
consistent
enough
to
object
now
for
some
reason
i
do
nt
mind
cutting
half
a
man
s
throat
it
s
what
you
want
herbert
matthew
herring
said
is
not
to
get
blood
on
your
hands
i
m
afraid
i
mean
because
you
do
nt
like
blood
not
because
you
intend
to
fool
anybody
now
doctor
lefferts
has
always
tacitly
supported
doctor
bull
and
he
will
support
him
to
the
last
ditch
it
s
just
a
professional
matter
making
common
cause
against
the
laymen
what
we
have
to
look
for
is
the
last
ditch
and
continue
the
discussion
there
yes
lucile
made
some
experiments
she
discovered
that
there
was
nt
a
great
deal
to
be
done
well
the
strength
of
doctor
lefferts
position
lies
in
the
fact
that
a
complaint
or
so
carries
no
weight
you
can
shrug
it
off
you
imply
that
every
one
is
perfectly
satisfied
except
a
few
cranks
nothing
can
satisfy
the
medical
profession
understands
that
it
s
been
suffering
from
a
few
cranks
for
centuries
but
i
think
if
you
could
show
that
every
one
in
throwing
doctor
bull
overboard
now
walter
mr
bates
jerked
his
finger
away
from
the
scalloped
shell
i
m
listening
he
said
quickly
what
would
you
think
of
calling
a
town
meeting
say
next
saturday
that
s
the
fourteenth
i
want
to
have
sev
eral
resolutions
presented
for
adoption
to
the
general
effect
that
doctor
bull
has
been
grossly
negligent
and
incompetent
and
is
unfit
to
hold
his
office
if
we
could
get
two
or
three
hundred
signatures
and
send
the
resolutions
along
with
a
petition
signed
by
all
the
town
officers
to
doctor
lefferts
i
think
lefferts
would
remove
him
i
do
nt
doubt
he
would
eric
cadbury
admitted
but
how
about
the
school
committee
that
s
a
matter
for
the
board
of
education
the
district
superintendent
would
be
within
his
rights
and
i
know
him
well
enough
to
be
able
to
say
he
would
exercise
his
rights
in
objecting
to
the
employment
of
any
unfit
person
dismissed
from
a
medical
office
for
carelessness
and
incompetence
would
certainly
come
in
the
class
of
unfit
persons
what
the
school
committee
agreed
on
or
did
nt
agree
on
would
nt
matter
doctor
bull
would
simply
be
removed
from
the
field
of
discussion
say
that
s
pretty
neat
eric
cadbury
said
any
objections
herbert
i
have
none
walter
bates
said
uneasily
yes
but
do
nt
you
think
maybe
we
ought
to
wait
until
later
i
mean
you
mean
said
mr
banning
that
doctor
bull
is
the
only
doctor
in
town
probably
he
is
better
than
none
so
let
s
be
sure
we
have
some
one
else
before
we
annoy
him
too
greatly
i
m
not
very
happy
about
this
matthew
the
state
health
department
would
step
in
if
necessary
matthew
herring
said
there
s
no
reason
to
worry
about
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
ve
spoken
to
doctor
verney
in
to
help
at
least
temporarily
and
he
gave
me
the
name
of
a
doctor
moses
in
torrington
i
did
nt
explain
the
situation
to
him
but
it
seems
that
there
d
be
no
difficulty
i
do
nt
mean
to
imply
that
any
of
this
is
going
to
make
any
one
very
happy
herbert
i
d
suggest
that
you
sacrifice
your
happiness
in
the
common
cause
you
score
admitted
mr
banning
smiling
briefly
you
are
nt
planning
to
go
all
the
way
home
for
luncheon
are
you
better
stay
here
i
m
expecting
doctor
verney
he
s
been
busy
helping
doctor
bull
with
the
inoculations
well
we
ll
be
going
eric
cadbury
said
i
m
sure
you
re
with
us
mr
banning
i
ca
nt
be
anywhere
else
it
seems
yes
of
course
you
have
my
support
for
what
it
s
worth
how
s
geraldine
today
walter
she
s
pretty
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
unexpectedly
i
mean
if
it
would
do
any
good
it
seems
kind
of
late
somehow
that
s
what
takes
the
heart
out
of
you
the
hills
to
the
river
and
spent
the
hours
there
and
these
sundays
there
were
nine
of
them
were
all
perfect
save
one
in
the
calm
morning
of
this
day
while
night
was
still
a
faint
fog
in
cove
and
glade
they
were
going
down
antelope
creek
they
left
the
road
and
turned
into
a
river
lane
and
climbed
a
hill
and
upon
looking
back
they
saw
a
man
filling
his
tank
from
the
creek
he
was
a
farmer
and
he
was
hauling
water
to
his
beasts
who
care
but
when
he
looked
at
neloa
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
curiously
alive
and
with
unerring
penetration
born
of
loneliness
and
self
searching
he
read
in
her
eyes
in
something
strangely
shadowed
there
a
warm
alert
interest
in
this
man
his
world
darkened
as
if
the
sun
of
his
happiness
had
passed
into
a
cloud
he
grasped
her
shoulders
and
looked
at
her
eyes
but
what
he
had
seen
there
was
gone
and
then
she
amazed
him
by
saying
i
know
who
he
is
who
who
is
asked
vridar
beginning
to
feelt
she
inclined
her
head
to
the
distant
man
heked
at
her
and
at
the
man
at
one
and
then
at
thecher
and
he
wondered
what
her
words
meant
and
the
man
was
now
looking
at
them
well
who
is
he
francis
henderson
oh
you
do
nt
say
well
who
s
francis
hen
rson
he
lives
over
there
she
man
now
waved
to
neloa
and
she
returnedgreeting
and
jealousy
rose
in
vridar
in
a
vomit
of
rage
it
choked
him
and
for
a
few
moments
left
him
speechless
he
stared
at
neloa
sick
with
doubt
in
perceiving
now
that
he
was
furious
she
changed
suddenly
in
the
manner
of
a
playing
child
that
is
baked
something
strange
entered
her
eyes
and
c
smile
left
her
mouth
let
s
go
on
she
said
no
vridar
said
he
was
determined
to
settle
is
matter
now
how
long
you
known
him
oh
about
a
year
you
been
out
with
him
his
face
was
so
morally
earnest
that
she
shrank
and
looked
scared
yes
she
said
i
low
many
times
only
once
only
once
when
was
that
oh
she
sighed
about
two
months
ago
how
long
before
before
you
came
up
weeks
she
was
annoyed
her
voice
trembled
now
and
there
was
dark
resentment
in
her
eyes
do
you
love
him
do
nt
be
silly
she
said
and
her
eyes
for
a
moment
were
like
fire
vridar
had
never
seen
this
neloa
before
he
was
touching
depths
that
he
had
suspected
but
had
never
found
he
drew
a
long
breath
feeling
that
he
was
silly
beyond
all
doubt
she
had
gone
with
him
once
she
had
waved
to
him
in
greeting
but
these
surely
were
no
matters
to
get
furious
about
he
took
her
arm
and
they
walked
again
she
was
pensive
and
sullen
now
if
he
pressed
her
arm
she
gave
no
response
and
he
wished
deeply
that
he
had
not
been
such
a
fool
i
m
sorry
he
said
he
looked
round
trying
to
meet
her
eyes
there
was
an
angry
dying
flush
in
her
cheeks
there
was
something
hard
and
glittering
in
her
stare
i
love
you
so
you
were
mean
she
said
all
right
anything
but
let
s
not
spoil
our
sunday
neloa
please
she
did
not
sigh
or
in
any
way
betray
her
thought
her
face
was
still
brooding
and
dark
he
stopped
and
drew
her
resisting
to
his
arms
and
she
put
her
hands
up
and
strove
to
push
him
away
neloa
please
i
m
awful
sorry
honest
please
do
nt
spoil
our
day
she
looked
at
him
and
he
didpnot
like
what
he
saw
in
her
eyes
he
had
seen
it
in
her
father
s
eyes
he
had
never
discovered
what
it
meant
neloa
he
cried
becoming
frantic
what
she
asked
and
looked
far
away
neloa
do
nt
you
love
me
now
she
hesitated
a
long
while
neloa
do
nt
you
i
guess
so
she
said
then
please
neloa
please
smile
no
yes
please
i
said
no
he
drew
her
to
him
again
and
she
did
not
resist
now
he
kissed
her
lips
and
eyes
smile
he
said
i
ll
kiss
you
until
you
smile
she
looked
at
him
and
very
slowly
she
smiled
the
darkness
left
her
eyes
andere
came
in
its
stead
a
whimsical
humor
that
he
loved
now
we
re
all
right
he
said
neloa
are
nt
we
but
not
for
hours
did
he
recover
the
lyric
sweetness
of
their
former
days
something
troubled
her
her
gayness
never
bright
or
spontaneous
touched
her
but
lightly
now
and
her
eyes
again
and
again
were
shadowed
and
still
but
he
reposed
in
her
largely
because
his
need
was
so
great
the
simplicity
and
the
trust
that
were
the
heart
of
his
life
and
another
incident
also
trifling
it
seemed
to
him
on
reflection
he
saw
her
only
on
the
sundays
of
these
weeks
but
on
the
mormon
holiday
the
twenty
fourth
of
july
he
mounted
his
pony
and
rode
forth
telling
himself
with
enormous
glee
that
he
would
surprise
her
when
he
came
within
sight
of
her
home
he
stopped
he
saw
neloa
in
the
yard
and
she
saw
him
too
it
seemed
because
at
once
she
dodged
round
a
building
and
entered
the
house
he
rode
down
the
lane
and
through
the
gate
after
greeting
her
parents
who
stood
in
the
yard
and
looked
at
him
as
they
always
did
rather
curiously
he
threw
the
reins
over
a
post
and
went
to
the
door
is
neloa
inside
he
asked
yes
said
tim
doole
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
strode
in
neloa
was
lying
on
a
bed
she
seemed
to
be
asleep
but
he
knew
she
was
not
nevertheless
when
he
spoke
to
her
she
did
not
answer
and
when
he
went
over
and
sat
on
he
said
you
re
not
asleep
she
affected
to
wake
and
to
be
astonished
she
stared
at
him
warm
velvet
seat
feeling
the
difficulties
before
her
if
she
was
to
keep
her
memory
of
perfection
forever
secure
and
undiminished
a
strapping
young
fellow
in
coveralls
came
toward
the
car
with
his
blond
hair
glinting
oh
you
folks
are
together
he
nodded
toward
the
oil
station
his
grin
with
the
flash
of
white
teeth
in
the
tanned
grease
smudged
face
had
an
easy
friendly
understanding
and
acceptance
margot
saw
bruce
s
firm
large
figure
as
he
leaned
with
one
elbow
on
the
counter
having
an
earnest
masculine
confabulation
with
the
oil
station
man
over
a
spread
out
map
and
the
pride
of
their
being
together
was
almost
more
than
she
could
endure
the
young
fellow
thumped
a
tire
he
was
sticking
around
because
he
admired
her
but
admiration
came
easy
now
that
she
no
longer
needed
it
not
had
this
car
very
long
have
you
margot
smiled
and
shook
her
head
in
her
brown
tweed
suit
and
light
felt
hat
and
the
scuffed
comfortable
easy
grace
of
her
laced
prince
of
wales
shoes
she
had
a
flattering
consciousness
of
herself
as
an
impressively
urban
figure
out
here
in
the
anonymous
countryside
i
saw
it
was
a
new
car
it
sure
lot
of
service
too
he
nodded
and
tapped
the
hood
in
appreciation
new
york
looks
like
you
folks
are
a
good
ways
from
home
going
out
to
the
coast
just
driving
sure
well
that
s
the
way
to
do
it
he
grinned
at
her
again
and
went
off
margot
could
see
the
gestures
of
the
two
men
inside
the
building
their
movements
had
a
pleasant
earthy
slowness
behind
the
sunny
glare
of
the
large
front
window
with
a
subtle
smile
of
feminine
contentment
margot
sat
back
to
wait
and
let
them
settle
the
question
of
the
roads
between
themselves
now
with
her
head
resting
against
the
soft
upholstery
and
her
bare
hands
folded
she
could
feel
the
sense
of
anonymous
country
leisure
widening
around
her
in
the
sunshine
a
good
ways
from
home
the
young
fellow
had
said
new
york
seemed
more
incredibly
far
away
to
margot
than
it
must
seem
to
him
only
that
speeding
stream
of
noisily
place
with
any
memory
of
the
city
and
even
the
cars
were
more
widely
spaced
than
they
had
been
she
thought
of
new
york
standing
incredibly
on
its
island
like
some
separate
walled
city
tall
and
feudal
and
feverishly
modern
existing
in
and
for
itself
a
crazy
pattern
of
streets
and
buildings
and
rushing
people
caught
in
the
thundering
network
of
trains
above
and
below
the
life
was
a
fevered
half
mad
half
splendid
dream
existing
within
the
dream
on
its
own
terms
of
terrible
immediacy
people
had
to
believe
in
it
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
existence
get
outside
and
it
was
incredible
margot
felt
the
slow
beginning
sweetness
of
a
kind
of
reconciliation
to
the
land
the
rough
dry
ground
smelled
good
a
tuneless
music
thrilled
along
the
telephone
wires
now
it
seemed
that
a
great
space
that
was
more
than
just
miles
of
country
lay
between
her
and
all
the
life
she
had
known
up
until
now
she
looked
at
bruce
standing
big
easy
and
absorbed
all
over
again
the
wonder
of
the
richness
with
which
his
love
had
endowed
her
adding
to
her
what
he
was
filling
out
the
empty
places
of
her
own
being
all
that
had
been
rudimentary
and
fragmentary
in
her
experience
was
miraculously
fulfilled
even
her
silly
old
notions
about
dr
redmond
at
home
about
having
an
affair
with
a
married
man
the
need
for
someone
big
and
competent
in
a
worldly
way
that
perhaps
she
had
got
from
her
old
admiration
of
frank
and
sybil
and
her
dissatisfaction
with
the
folks
the
desire
for
the
shock
and
delight
of
what
was
different
from
herself
that
had
first
been
aroused
when
she
had
seen
jesse
and
dorothy
exchanging
their
bridal
kiss
at
this
moment
margot
s
life
seemed
to
her
an
illuminated
landscape
in
which
all
the
lines
were
in
perfect
focus
bruce
reached
out
and
put
his
forefinger
on
a
spot
on
the
map
there
was
something
personal
in
that
little
gesture
something
that
she
recognized
as
bruce
something
dominating
of
hot
possession
it
frightened
her
threatening
her
ideal
conception
of
love
which
dictated
that
it
must
end
when
it
was
over
her
fear
seemed
suddenly
to
strike
her
with
a
distant
vicious
hatred
of
the
shadowy
figure
of
the
wife
who
must
have
seen
that
very
movement
who
knew
the
brief
accurately
judging
squint
with
which
bruce
sized
up
a
hill
before
they
came
to
it
the
way
in
which
he
accomplished
everything
with
that
satisfyingly
competent
minimum
of
movement
she
wanted
to
blast
the
woman
into
forgetfulness
to
scorn
her
out
of
existence
with
a
piercing
overflow
of
jealousy
margot
seized
bruce
s
heavy
driving
glove
that
he
had
thrust
into
a
pocket
of
the
upholstery
and
pressed
it
up
against
her
face
but
an
hour
of
yesterday
was
something
that
only
she
herself
and
bruce
would
ever
know
margot
felt
that
it
had
annulled
everything
that
went
before
it
the
men
whom
she
had
known
before
she
knew
bruce
seemed
to
have
been
washed
out
of
existence
was
now
it
was
this
moment
sunny
and
still
in
the
great
slow
drift
of
time
and
she
was
living
in
it
bruce
came
out
still
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
map
he
spread
it
open
against
the
wheel
margot
fidgeted
in
her
seat
she
felt
a
qualm
of
the
minutely
vigilant
fear
which
still
had
to
keep
its
strained
hold
beneath
the
surface
of
her
happiness
she
sat
scarcely
breathing
if
they
had
already
had
the
best
of
their
love
and
bruce
was
beginning
to
forget
about
her
then
it
had
to
be
and
to
try
to
do
anything
would
be
only
a
violation
bruce
s
right
hand
slipped
down
from
the
wheel
and
groped
softly
and
blindly
for
hers
she
felt
the
even
clasp
everything
swung
into
focus
again
of
the
crew
were
dividing
their
time
between
the
catching
of
eels
and
the
exchange
of
hoarse
pleasantries
with
the
occupants
of
small
boats
engaged
in
the
sale
of
onions
checked
shirts
flatfish
apple
brandy
red
wine
lace
and
mussels
with
reluctance
they
abandoned
their
fishing
removed
the
hatch
and
fell
to
swaying
bales
on
deck
in
preparation
for
the
afternoon
s
unloading
marvin
having
put
them
to
work
inspected
the
galley
and
the
forecastle
examined
the
guns
with
a
mind
to
having
them
scraped
and
repainted
then
still
with
the
thought
cabin
to
look
for
spots
that
would
be
better
for
a
brushful
the
cabin
was
divided
into
two
sections
and
it
was
the
smaller
of
these
that
corunna
still
occupied
at
its
door
marvin
hesitated
but
only
for
a
moment
there
seemed
to
him
when
he
entered
to
be
something
of
corunna
about
this
small
white
room
with
its
standing
bedplace
and
its
wide
lockers
an
air
of
sturdiness
and
crispness
drawn
over
the
bedplace
was
a
patchwork
quilt
that
almost
glittered
in
the
brilliance
of
its
colors
and
folded
neatly
on
it
lay
her
needlework
that
worsted
work
of
art
representing
the
holy
family
gazing
with
suspicion
at
the
towers
of
jerusalem
marvin
touching
it
gingerly
with
his
forefinger
smiled
a
little
from
it
there
seemed
to
rise
a
faint
fragrance
of
sweet
grass
and
mallow
such
as
had
come
to
him
so
often
from
the
arundel
meadows
on
summer
nights
he
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
and
around
at
the
white
panels
of
this
neat
small
cabin
then
moved
to
the
a
chinese
courting
mirror
over
it
and
a
swinging
whale
oil
lamp
of
pewter
and
copper
with
small
paintings
of
her
mother
and
father
on
either
side
the
painting
of
her
mother
marvin
thought
would
be
corunna
to
the
life
if
in
place
of
the
low
black
dress
edged
at
the
neck
with
wooden
seeming
lace
the
portrait
showed
her
in
a
stained
and
darned
chinese
jacket
with
a
collar
that
came
high
up
around
her
throat
and
fastened
with
three
jade
buttons
he
slipped
the
oval
frame
from
its
hook
through
the
tightly
drawn
black
hair
gleamed
a
white
ear
tip
the
lips
seemed
to
tremble
on
the
verge
of
a
smile
in
the
smooth
column
of
the
throat
as
marvin
studied
it
there
was
almost
the
beating
of
a
pulse
he
touched
the
pictured
throat
gently
with
his
finger
the
scent
of
sweet
grass
and
mallow
came
to
him
again
and
the
face
at
which
he
looked
softened
and
became
charming
as
had
corunna
s
on
that
night
off
rio
he
lifted
he
guiltily
raised
his
eyes
to
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
reflected
also
in
the
mirror
was
the
stern
window
and
through
the
mirrored
window
he
saw
far
down
the
estuary
a
tall
black
schooner
beating
up
on
the
rising
tide
from
the
channel
close
hauled
on
the
larboard
tack
he
quickly
hung
the
picture
in
its
place
turned
to
the
window
and
examined
the
rig
and
cut
of
the
distant
vessel
despite
the
briskness
of
the
southwest
breeze
she
rode
stiff
in
the
water
heeling
over
so
little
that
no
part
of
her
copper
showed
if
indeed
there
was
copper
on
her
she
was
marvin
felt
too
large
for
a
smuggler
and
he
knew
as
well
that
there
was
scarce
a
smuggler
in
either
france
or
england
but
use
a
either
a
lugger
or
a
cutter
in
his
trade
in
preference
to
a
schooner
she
might
he
told
himself
be
a
french
privateer
but
it
was
doubtful
since
her
top
hamper
was
lacking
in
delicacy
to
his
mind
distance
he
could
see
from
the
spread
of
her
ratlines
that
she
carried
more
shrouds
and
backstays
than
diron
and
argandeau
would
consider
needful
and
it
was
plain
that
she
was
rigged
for
strength
rather
than
for
great
speed
furthermore
she
showed
no
colors
which
seemed
to
him
unusual
for
a
vessel
entering
a
home
port
after
a
cruise
vaguely
uneasy
but
more
curious
than
uneasy
he
took
corunna
s
telescope
from
the
rack
beside
her
bedplace
and
went
on
deck
where
a
score
of
bales
had
risen
from
the
hold
to
clutter
the
amidships
section
increasingly
uneasy
he
mounted
to
the
mizzen
top
and
focused
the
glass
on
the
schooner
which
had
come
about
on
the
far
side
of
the
estuary
she
was
pointing
downstream
from
the
olive
branch
but
from
the
set
of
the
tide
it
appeared
to
marvin
that
when
the
stranger
next
came
about
she
would
be
abreast
of
the
barque
through
the
glass
he
could
see
guns
on
her
deck
which
was
nothing
strange
and
her
ports
the
guns
so
that
she
looked
peaceable
enough
he
was
a
fool
he
told
himself
to
be
disturbed
over
a
harmless
merchantman
running
home
nc
doubt
with
rum
and
sugar
from
martinico
and
with
that
he
polished
the
lenses
of
the
glass
with
a
fold
of
his
shirt
and
stared
even
harder
at
her
from
far
behind
him
he
heard
a
hail
a
boat
he
saw
was
bobbing
toward
the
olive
branch
from
the
direction
of
morlaix
a
boat
with
three
men
in
it
as
he
looked
the
man
in
the
stern
sheets
rose
to
his
feet
pointing
and
waving
toward
the
oncoming
schooner
and
hailed
again
marvin
saw
with
a
faint
trembling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
that
the
man
was
argandeau
what
it
was
that
he
shouted
marvin
could
not
hear
nor
did
he
need
to
hear
phis
thoughts
churned
in
his
head
like
wheels
spinning
in
butter
if
i
can
pile
her
up
on
shore
he
thought
she
but
do
nt
have
time
i
m
making
it
easier
to
lose
her
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
the
schooner
to
marvin
the
mile
wide
estuary
seemed
to
have
shrunk
in
size
the
white
cottages
on
the
far
shore
so
distant
until
now
must
he
thought
have
drawn
near
to
stare
critically
at
him
the
schooner
pushing
the
bottom
of
page
that
it
is
wiser
to
take
voltaire
s
advice
by
cultivating
her
garden
and
bringing
up
her
pickaninnies
than
to
spend
her
life
imagining
she
can
find
a
complete
explanation
of
the
universe
by
laying
about
her
with
a
knobkerry
and
what
smirt
do
you
infer
from
that
i
find
in
that
sentence
all
highest
something
very
like
a
formal
palinode
that
after
laying
about
him
for
some
and
forty
years
with
his
own
knobkerry
with
the
shillalah
of
a
peculiarly
fine
intelligence
at
least
one
free
thinker
did
not
ever
light
on
a
complete
explanation
of
any
universe
which
was
populated
by
both
his
admirers
and
your
admirers
i
infer
in
brief
from
this
sentence
that
a
free
thinker
think
he
never
so
freely
and
for
no
matter
how
many
decades
may
come
to
notice
that
he
does
not
know
every
smirt
thing
not
even
at
the
comparative
maturity
of
his
later
seventies
not
even
after
some
forty
years
of
explaining
everything
with
entire
lucidity
and
i
believe
that
every
free
thinker
is
called
upon
by
and
by
to
face
if
but
obliquely
if
only
for
an
instant
this
surprising
outcome
the
all
highest
smiled
he
declared
in
half
chuckling
protest
come
now
smirt
that
appears
a
great
deal
to
deduce
from
one
sentence
yet
there
may
be
something
in
what
you
say
and
with
your
permission
i
will
try
another
one
of
those
excellent
smirt
continued
this
is
a
state
of
mind
which
is
reached
sooner
or
later
by
the
best
informed
no
one
of
us
understands
everything
i
myself
for
example
do
not
know
what
de
witt
clinton
is
thinking
about
so
intently
on
this
united
states
internal
revenue
cigarette
stamp
i
do
not
know
why
the
clock
on
the
front
page
of
the
herald
tribune
is
set
at
twelve
minutes
after
six
nor
why
the
king
of
hearts
and
the
jack
of
clubs
are
the
only
male
court
cards
not
to
have
a
mustache
nor
why
a
barber
s
pole
should
always
revolve
its
three
colored
spiral
downwards
what
lightness
what
clan
i
have
often
reflected
sir
would
be
gained
did
this
pole
revolve
more
aspiringly
upwards
with
the
appropriate
optimism
of
its
owner
s
imaginings
in
regard
to
the
benefits
of
shampoos
and
of
singeing
and
of
hair
tonics
these
are
indeed
deep
mysteries
smirt
but
we
were
not
talking
about
shampoos
nor
do
i
perceive
what
hair
tonics
have
to
do
which
i
might
mention
is
still
selling
excellently
i
was
about
to
observe
all
highest
that
every
at
all
rational
free
thinker
must
come
by
and
by
to
questi
the
main
article
of
his
own
faith
as
it
was
defined
by
mr
gilbert
chesterton
in
the
remote
days
when
mr
chesterton
had
genius
that
because
something
has
satisfied
generations
of
men
it
must
be
untrue
with
a
little
more
experience
sir
one
begins
to
suspect
that
not
even
god
can
be
disposed
of
by
having
at
him
with
a
knobkerry
under
such
treatment
god
vanishes
it
is
true
but
it
seems
equally
true
that
god
may
just
possibly
not
find
in
that
special
form
of
address
any
reason
for
taking
the
addresser
into
his
complete
confidence
after
glancing
every
whither
from
under
his
shaggy
white
brows
and
after
making
sure
nobody
was
listening
the
all
highest
spoke
in
a
confidential
lowered
voice
saying
i
admit
simply
between
ourselves
smirt
that
i
do
not
find
assault
and
battery
an
endearing
smirt
the
all
highest
confides
and
i
promise
you
all
highest
smirt
replied
reassuringly
that
i
shall
never
approach
you
in
this
fashion
i
confess
to
a
little
dubiety
whensoever
anybody
takes
the
bleak
trouble
to
point
out
that
through
no
human
logic
can
be
justified
your
existence
sir
it
occurs
to
me
i
mean
that
before
advancing
this
two
edged
argument
one
would
be
called
upon
first
to
justify
in
logic
one
s
own
existence
and
i
have
yet
to
meet
the
man
who
could
do
this
come
now
said
the
old
gentleman
as
pleased
as
in
the
cliche
is
punch
but
that
is
handsomely
said
you
speak
well
smirt
with
a
broad
mindedness
which
i
do
not
often
encounter
among
modern
writers
such
speaking
deserves
a
reward
so
to
you
smirt
i
will
gladly
explain
everything
thereupon
the
all
highest
explained
everything
he
explained
first
about
barbers
poles
and
about
the
king
of
hearts
but
without
committing
himself
of
clubs
and
about
the
herald
tribune
clock
and
about
de
witt
clinton
then
the
all
highest
went
on
to
explain
his
conduct
of
the
universe
and
smirt
listened
with
ever
growing
dismay
it
does
not
please
you
smirt
to
know
that
which
no
mortal
man
has
known
before
you
oh
as
to
that
all
highest
i
appreciate
your
confidence
i
am
honored
sir
i
assure
you
nor
is
it
quite
my
province
perhaps
to
dictate
to
you
in
these
cosmic
affairs
nevertheless
smirt
do
you
speak
your
mind
freely
for
an
instant
smirt
looked
appraisingly
at
the
gray
cloudland
which
spread
every
whither
about
them
all
seemed
most
satisfactorily
chaotic
and
yet
as
smirt
now
knew
there
was
no
chaos
anywhere
it
was
a
defect
over
which
smirt
perforce
shook
his
head
thereafter
smirt
answered
with
urbane
self
restraint
i
can
but
say
sir
that
your
methods
are
out
of
date
the
entire
system
is
an
anachronism
and
canons
of
civilized
art
i
had
feared
the
all
highest
replied
in
an
apologetic
way
that
my
methods
could
hardly
hope
for
your
approval
i
have
read
your
books
of
course
with
vast
admiration
and
some
unavoidable
envy
you
and
i
smirt
are
creative
artists
who
belong
to
different
schools
you
should
allow
for
that
fact
before
dismissing
my
work
as
of
no
merit
at
all
but
this
work
of
yours
all
highest
as
you
have
confessed
to
me
is
government
it
has
a
formal
plan
it
is
rational
it
involves
the
long
ago
exploded
notion
of
a
personal
creator
all
climbed
down
to
the
carpet
edward
said
giving
the
hammock
a
swing
with
his
foot
against
the
floor
that
was
because
i
knew
that
what
he
was
talking
about
was
his
big
self
then
mamma
whispered
to
you
to
go
take
the
general
s
hand
he
was
the
most
popular
hero
in
the
united
states
but
you
would
nt
so
you
came
and
sat
by
me
on
the
corner
sofa
you
said
he
smelled
like
cake
he
kept
vanilla
beans
in
his
armoire
to
scent
his
linen
but
we
did
nt
know
that
i
sat
by
you
and
felt
very
sadzo
so
red
the
rose
because
i
thought
a
hero
could
eat
up
all
the
cake
if
he
wanted
to
if
we
d
always
done
the
way
mamma
wanted
us
to
we
d
have
been
angels
by
now
buddie
do
you
think

dull

stopped
the

with
his
loot
plague
take
it
what
do
you
mean
simple
plague
take
it

mr
edward
mcgehee
i
am
always
wondering
why
he
wo
nt
just
pack
off
these
old
psalm
singers
out
of
the
house
what
she
referred
to
was
the
way
they
had
at
montrose
of
giving
shelter
e
ery
winter
to
two
or
three
invalids
from
the
north
recommended
to
hugh
mcgehee
by
some
minister
or
other
in
the
church
two
rooms
in
the
south
wing
were
reserved
for
this
charitable
practice
the
two
now
were
mr
munger
from
wisconsin
and
mr
triplet
from
providence
lucy
went
on
father
d
let
mr
munger
bring
his
medicine
bottles
to
the
table
if
mamma
had
nt
put
her
foot
down
and
yet
look
at
the
sense
papa
s
got
what
he
says
about
people
like
mr
munger
s
ancestors
what
does
he
say
says
it
s
not
so
much
that
these
people
are
not
well
born
they
do
nt

nt
like
it
edward
said
laughing
it

not
that
you

trying
to
descend
from
alfred
the
great
papa
says
what
you
want
is
to
be
connected
with
something
larger
than
yourself
but
it
s
no
use
telling
mr
munger
if
you
re
mr
munger
you
want
to
be
self
made
certainly
then
you
re
the
first
to
get
there
t
would
be
rude
with
a
bang
said
lucy
to
tell
mr
munger
just
where
he
s
got
you

buddie
papa

certainlygot
sense

of
the
conversation
of
the
three
northerners
about
slavery
and
secession
god
would
punish
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
south
they
said
except
that
miss
whipple
did
not
think
darkies
should
be
slaves
she
thought
they
ought
to
be
all
taken
out
and
shot
you
ask
for
a
glass
of
water
miss
whipple
said
you
may
get
it
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
you
may
never
get
it
at
all
what
i
wish

lucy
continued
i
could
bray
the
way
i
used
to
you

the
time

whipple
told
papa
on
me
because
i
asked
her
why

nt
say
mc
gee

same
though
i
like
our
old
donkey
pike
better
i
like
her
more
than

do
the
theologues
lucy
s
voice
suddenly
changed
as
he
put
her
hand
through
his
arm
edward
are
you
really
going
to
enlist
he
turned
and
looked
into
her
eyes
quietly
then
kissed
her
brow
i
know
you
are
right
i
know
you
are
right
because
you
are
good
she
said
as
if
to
her
own
thoughts
presently
as
they
talked
lucy
began
to
complain
of
how
everybody
talked
of
secession
and
the
war
to
suit
themselves
but
her
mother
interrupted
by
coming
to
say
there
were
guests
who
wanted
her
to
sing
judge
and
mrs
winchester
and
colonel
harrod
were
in
the
parlor
io
so
red
the
rose
mamma
i

lucy
said
frowning

until
monsieur
la
tour
has
taught
me
a
little
at
least
colonel

praising

acteurs
lucy
said
turning
to
edward
monsieur
la
tour

for
stupid
actors
god

stupid
spectators
i
know
it
s
considered
a
most
elegant
tendency
to
run
into
the
french
but
my
child
had
better
give
up
french
if
it
s
goingto
make
her
so
tart
her
mother
said
stroking
the
brown
head

old
colonel

but
i
did
nt
propose

honey
i
know
i
m
sorry
lucinda
said
rising
but
not
touching
her
mother
as
they
moved
toward
the
long
window
that
would
take
them
through
the
library
to
the
parlor
i
ll
try
gladly
i
do
nt
know
what
s
come
over
me
lately
mamma
sometimes
i
think
i
m
the
sort
will
live
on
and
on
till
they
have
to
put
out
poison
for
me
the
bottom
of
the
well
judge
winchester
has
an
ear
for
music
when
edward
heard
lucy
singing
a
few
moments
later
he
understood
that
he
could
see
deeper
into
her
nature
than
his
mother
could
as
he
heard
now
the
low
rich
voice
moving
through
the
song
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
and
sat
motionless
listening
solitary
and
eager
both
his
father
and
mother
loved
lucy
and
admired
her
night
he
got
warmed
up
and
talked
by
the
hour
it
was
either
rupert
prince
he
talked
about
or
else
the
old
prince
people
who
had
done
big
things
in
their
day
he
had
nt
talked
so
much
in
years
it
was
because
his
nephew
was
there
with
him
now
and
he
did
nt
want
him
to
give
up
the
idea
of
getting
ahead
in
life
and
for
night
after
night
till
all
hours
if
he
did
nt
talk
it
might
be
the
boy
would
sit
back
and
not
try
to
get
ahead
at
all
just
as
he
had
done
himself
just
as
his
own
brother
had
done
his
nephew
was
spending
altogether
too
much
time
down
in
the
cove
with
his
lobster
traps
in
his
opinion
if
he
d
had
his
way
the
boy
never
would
have
touched
one
of
the
things
will
had
rigged
up
a
boat
out
of
kilter
for
years
he
had
taken
to
lobstering
and
tinkering
with
boats
too
easily
it
was
bad
it
was
his
father
coming
out
in
him
all
over
uncle
frank
had
to
do
something
he
was
afraid
of
what
was
ahead
he
d
fight
the
father
in
him
with
the
grandfather
and
great
grandfather
with
his
own
cousin
rupert
he
d
wake
the
boy
up
if
talking
could
do
it
so
he
talked
to
will
far
into
the
night
till
morning
more
than
once
the
birds
would
for
uncle
frank
every
word
he
said
about
the
ambitious
old
princes
was
like
something
said
against
himself
he
had
sat
back
and
taken
it
easy
that
was
nt
what
the
old
fellows
had
done
not
by
a
long
shot
he
did
nt
have
something
the
old
princes
had
in
them
gumption
get
up
and
go
stick
to
itiveness
some
modern
folks
called
it
guts
there
were
different
names
for
it
they
all
meant
the
same
thing
whatever
it
was
it
had
died
in
him
it
had
died
in
his
own
brother
dan
daniel
did
nt
know
it
had
and
he
kept
on
doing
something
every
minute
of
his
time
all
day
and
all
the
part
of
the
night
he
was
awake
he
had
more
work
than
you
could
shake
a
stick
at
but
it
was
nt
the
work
that
got
him
ahead
not
the
right
kind
did
nt
get
him
anywhere
he
was
dead
and
done
for
perhaps
will
did
nt
have
that
thing
maybe
it
had
died
in
young
uncle
frank
would
see
if
he
had
it
in
him
he
d
find
it
out

a
winter

down
to
his
boat
one
morning
and
found
it
frozen
into
the
bay

he
cut
away
the
ice
around
it
and
pulled
it
out
on
the
beach
to
wait
till
the
ice
broke
up
again
it
did
nt
break
up
so
at
last
he
hauled
it
up
on
the
bank
and
covered
it
with
fir
boughs
every
morning
the
edge
of
the
still
part
of

farther

towards
the
skyline

a
boat
at

landing
and
took
in

last
of
his
traps
it
was
a
tough
job
but
he
finished
it
one
day
in
early
january
when
the
night
and
the
white
new
shore
to
menhaden
had
gone
out
so
far
that
the
ocean
looked
like
just
a
narrow
wicked
dark
blue
edging
away
out
on
the
sky
even
from
high
up
the
hill
they
said
down
at
the
post
office

frozen

near
the
house
before
the
week

heard
down
at
the
store
that
his
father
had
been
there
and
gone
he
had
a
drag
made
out
of
peeled
spruce
boughs
and
he
had
loaded
her
down
with
a
big
supply
of
provisions
will
went
down
to
the
wharf
when
nobody
was
looking
his
father

tracks
were
there
all
right
it
was
just
after
sunset
the
light
was
clearer
than
day
had
been
the
tracks
went
straight
out
into
the
evening
glow
and
disappeared
in
the
haze
he
would
have
given
anything
to
follow
the
tracks
out
there
to
the
island
he
pile
until
the
evening
glow
was
gone
and
the
blazing
winter
stars
had
begun
to
come
out
that
night

ears
of
popcorn

up
in
the

it
had
been
hanging
there
by
its
braided
husks
lord
knew
how
many
years
but
it
popped
all
right
she
made
a
bowl
of
popcorn
for
will
and
uncle

that
was
the
night
of
the
big
snowstorm
a
wall
of
dry
powdery
snow
miles
high
was
moving
offshore
with
the
sound
of
a
thousand
seething
kettles
it
had
begun
at
noontime
it
went
on
steadily
without
a
let
up
by
dusk
the
white
earth
had
risen
up
almost
to
the
windowsills
of
the
house
uncle
frank
and
will
sat
by
the
hearth
fire
and
ate
the
popcorn
and
uncle
frank
told
about
the
night
the
ariadne
had
been
lost
just
another
such
a
night
as
this
not
ten
miles
from
here
on
the
whaleboat
south
ledges

always
five
hundred
tons
she
was
the
pride
of

then
they
had
always
remembered
it
in
the
family
samuel
had
sworn
it
tasted
like
its
name
he
had
opened
up
one
chest
of
it
i
do
nt
see
how
i
could
have
missed
them
on
thebridge
i
never
did
before
what
s
he
going
to
do
he
s
getting
george
to
put
a
padlock
on
the
piano
andrissa
s
to
take
lessons
at
miss
ada
joy
s
from
now
on
then
you
wo
nt
ever
get
a
chance
at
it
again
i
guess
not
he
sighed
heavily
anyway
not
till
i
m
grown
up
and
go
away
from
here
it
s
meaner
than
mean
i
kicked
at
the
clapboards
till
my
toes
tingled
we
were
silent
there
together
for
a
long
time
the
western
sky
the
dark
points
of
the
spruces
gulls
were
letting
the
sunset
take
them
home
to
the
outer
islands
and
the
white
washed
tower
of
whale
back
light
stood
out
to
sea
like
a
far
candle
maybe
i
said
he
would
nt
lock
it
up
if
we
all
went
and
said
we
were
sorry
and
we
would
nt
do
it
again
but
i
would
he
shook
his
dark
head
first
chance
i
got
i
d
give
up
going
to
the
launching
i
promised
in
sudden
recklessness
if
t
would
do
any
good
it
would
nt
he
began
to
drum
on
the
window
sill
it
was
a
way
he
had
making
up
tunes
that
only
he
knew
and
understood
i
guess
we
have
to
wait
till
we
grow
up
to
do
things
we
want
to
i
told
him
i
know
he
agreed
but
it
s
a
long
way
off
well
nat
remember
what
old
lady
phibben
said
when
she
looked
at
your
hands
i
reminded
him
she
said
you
d
be
spreading
them
out
in
glory
someday
it
was
funny
that
part
about
the
white
horses
was
nt
it
he
looked
thoughtful
father
s
are
all
bays
and
sorrel
you
watch
out
same
s
she
said
to
i
cautioned
just
then
a
door
banged
somewhere
below
us
and
steps
sounded
on
the
brick
walk
that
meant
supper
was
over
and
it
would
be
bettertime
out
of
mind
for
me
not
to
linger
still
i
hated
to
go
and
i
had
nt
said
what
i
had
meant
to
it
was
different
talking
to
nat
like
this
just
the
two
of
us
by
ourselves
without
rissa
to
break
in
nat
i
tried
again
and
the
words
came
out
in
a
sudden
burst
it
was
easier
now
that
i
could
hardly
see
his
face
for
the
fading
light
i
ll
i
do
nt
once
i
had
got
them
out
i
felt
unaccountably
shy
and
foolish
so
i
let
myself
down
to
the
ell
roof
and
made
off
withoutwaiting
for
any
answer
chapter
vhow
shall
i
write
of
those
early
fall
mornings
how
shall
i
tell
of
the
peculiar
glaze
that
came
upon
every
berry
and
leaf
and
grass
blade
or
how
the
sea
was
bright
beyond
all
believing
and
crickets
beating
out
their
shrill
pulses
in
the
burnt
brown
grass
it
was
as
if
some
inner
hint
of
frost
quickened
every
living
thing
to
put
forth
its
best
of
color
and
fruit
and
song
we
three
children
felt
it
stirring
in
our
veins
though
we
had
no
means
to
show
it
except
our
overflowing
high
spirits
that
was
my
first
sight
of
september
by
this
northern
coast
and
though
i
have
seen
so
many
autumns
flare
since
then
never
yet
have
i
been
able
to
believe
in
the
glory
my
eyes
were
beholding
day
after
day
we
watched
the
dark
wedges
of
wild
geese
fly
south
and
marveled
at
deep
with
frosty
warning
how
do
they
know
i
asked
rissa
and
nat
the
first
time
i
saw
the
dark
wings
and
long
shifting
triangles
pass
overhead
how
do
they
know
when
it
s
time
and
where
to
go
they
must
have
little
compasses
inside
them
nat
told
me
that
s
where
they
have
it
easier
than
people
yes
rissa
said
but
they
are
nt
smart
enough
to
tell
the
decoy
ducks
from
real
ones
george
has
got
his
out
already
and
he
s
going
to
put
them
down
by
the
creek
soon
does
he
shoot
them
i
was
horrified
as
i
had
been
before
about
the
seals
oh
yes
she
nodded
father
says
there
s
nothing
he
likes
so
much
as
a
roast
wild
duck
but
nat
and
i
wo
nt
ever
touch
a
mouthful
we
could
nt
nat
said
making
a
face
time
out
of
mind
s
agreed
i
think
it
s
dreadful
settingout
wooden
ones
that
look
like
their
mates
to
trap
them
and
shoot
them
down
i
hope
they
fool
george
and
get
away
but
for
all
our
wishes
george
shot
plenty
that
fall
i
can
remember
the
sight
of
the
first
one
he
brought
in
as
it
lay
on
the
kitchen
table
i
did
not
want
to
look
at
it
but
horror
and
curiosity
drew
me
there
in
spite
of
myself
it
was
so
different
from
the
taut
living
birds
i
had
seen
taking
the
blue
only
a
little
while
before
this
one
lay
heavy
and
limp
a
heap
of
feathers
that
showed
shifting
colors
as
i
blew
on
the
soft
breast
and
head
the
wings
were
lax
and
long
and
the
feet
strong
and
webbed
yet
delicate
in
all
their
creasings
blood
had
dripped
and
dried
on
the
proud
beak
and
the
open
eyes
though
they
were
glazed
in
death
still
kept
a
kind
of
wild
surprise
i
could
nt
help
thinking
of
the
by
and
as
i
did
so
i
turned
and
ran
crying
from
the
kitchen
mother
was
put
out
later
when
i
would
nt
help
her
pluck
it
now
do
nt
you
go
and
get
notions
she
scolded
it
s
all
very
well
for
nat
and
rissa
to
get
finicky
but
you
ca
nt
where
would
i
be
if
i
took
on
so
over
every
dead
bird
i
had
to
cook
but
she
could
nt
make
me
touch
a
feather
i
think
she
was
glad
that
the
fall
term
of
school
would
begin
for
me
in
having
corley
did
nt
you
well
they
are
that
s
why
he
fallen
asleep
while
on
duty
is
in
town
really
they
ve
been
together
almost
constantly
sonia
was
saying
to
dr
norwood
you
and
patricia
and
they
had
arranged
to
see
each
other
this
afternoon
at
must
have
had
a
wonderful
time
this
afternoon
she
came
in
simply
beaming
old
college
friends
who
kept
him
so
long
that
elise
who
and
dr
norwood
purringly
pleased
and
self
conscious
is
rather
impulsive
thought
he
had
forgotten
so
she
as
a
cat
caught
in
the
cream
had
replied
indeed
with
was
out
when
he
arrived
they
have
nt
seen
each
other
such
unsuccess
at
casualness
that
he
had
hastened
to
add
since
not
alone
i
mean
and
i
observe
that
there
in
a
confidential
tone
it
was
a
great
day
for
me
sonia
is
i
asked
her
sonia
was
continuing
teasingly
how
she
danger
of
a
slight
frost
tonight
cannily
assisted
mr
liked
the
new
university
library
you
were
to
have
taken
sinclair
as
dr
norwood
at
that
unpropitious
moment
her
there
you
remember
and
she
looked
a
bit
dazed
for
turned
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
his
hostess
we
a
minute
and
then
said
oh
that
it
s
quite
wonderful
occasionally
have
them
nt
it
i
mean
we
did
nt
get
there
drove
up
to
lake
middle
of
may
he
raised
his
bushy
brows
to
dr
norwood
grove
instead
everything
so
beautiful
marvelous
who
felt
obliged
to
confess
he
d
never
noticed
andy
i
told
you
the
right
woman
would
show
up
some
so
that
accounted
for
what
was
going
on
at
the
other
end
day
did
nt
i
she
persisted
when
his
reply
had
been
of
the
table
mr
corley
was
proving
by
his
gaiety
that
so
slightly
delayed
by
a
sip
of
consomme
dr
norwood
far
as
he
was
concerned
there
was
peace
on
earth
and
good
grinned
amiably
nodded
an
indulgent
affirmation
and
will
among
men
nor
did
any
constraint
exist
between
him
self
and
a
fellow
creature
and
miss
graham
not
to
be
outdone
by
this
geniality
was
demonstrating
a
guileless
gladness
that
would
have
made
a
surly
cynic
of
pollyanna
elise
had
it
appeared
been
just
now
in
receipt
really
was
an
awful
blarney
and
the
table
gradually
drawn
into
it
was
making
appreciative
little
noises
in
confirmation
of
this
tribute
which
she
well
deserved
for
she
had
indeed
sung
beautifully
and
it
was
no
more
than
fair
mrs
crandall
thought
that
elise
should
have
the
entire
stage
to
herself
while
she
took
her
bow
she
accepted
the
applause
very
prettily
and
began
re
plying
to
queries
the
dean
s
first
who
wanted
to
know
something
about
life
in
little
leeds
and
simpson
s
who
hoped
she
would
give
them
the
high
lights
on
her
recent
spectacular
debut
in
louisville
perhaps
it
was
the
pro
prietorial
complacency
of
mr
corley
s
expression
that
determined
elise
s
decision
to
share
her
honors
with
her
valued
friend
nathan
parker
who
she
gratefully
con
ceded
was
responsible
for
her
success
and
without
whose
timely
assistance
she
might
have
gone
on
for
life
unrecog
nized
she
spoke
his
name
softly
caressingly
tell
them
about
him
dear
urged
mrs
she
added
intimately
and
with
promisinglittle
nods
to
sonia
whose
eyes
she
had
happened
to
pick
up
at
the
moment
well
to
make
a
long
story
of
it
began
elise
girlishly
ingenuous
nathan
parker
mysteriously
dropped
in
at
leeds
late
last
fall
on
no
particular
errand
accompanied
by
a
valuable
red
setter
i
say
piped
mr
talbot
s
oxonian
treble
dashed
if
that
is
nt
odd
was
nt
that
the
chap
s
name
sir
you
said
would
return
to
claim
a
dog
he
d
left
here
yesterday
he
must
have
done
so
while
i
was
out
dean
harcourt
seemed
unimpressed
by
this
coincidence
returning
his
attention
immediately
to
miss
graham
im
plying
with
a
nod
that
her
narrative
had
the
right
of
way
simpson
was
observed
to
be
grinningly
mumbling
something
into
phyllis
s
ear
which
brought
a
quick
flush
to
her
cheeks
and
an
entreating
glance
toward
sonia
whose
alert
eyes
registered
a
knowledgeable
interest
but
by
jove
of
simpson
s
you
must
have
seen
him
miss
dexter
and
the
dog
too
whatever
became
of
him
the
dog
i
mean
better
tell
him
growled
simpson
so
miss
graham
can
proceed
it
s
his
british
instinct
once
he
gets
hold
of
an
idea
you
might
as
well
help
him
work
it
out
for
there
s
no
peace
until
it
s
no
secret
said
phyllis
evenly
the
dog
insisted
ongoing
along
with
me
when
i
left
and
we
met
mr
parker
outside
then
that
ca
nt
possibly
be
my
mr
parker
commented
elise
decisively
though
it
is
a
fact
that
nathan
parker
is
in
town
i
hope
to
see
him
tomorrow
but
i
happen
to
know
that
sylvia
would
nt
walk
away
with
anyone
sylvia
exclaimed
several
voices
in
various
pitches
of
incredulity
yes
and
a
one
man
dog
if
there
ever
was
such
an
animal
if
sylvia
nt
i
m
sure
it
would
not
be
a
girl
she
hates
women
i
saw
her
nearly
every
day
for
months
and
she
never
thawed
out
not
the
least
bit
mrs
crandall
thought
she
observed
a
little
smile
playing
about
phyllis
s
eyes
which
were
raised
to
meet
sonia
s
and
sonia
looking
into
them
was
replying
with
a
slow
sly
wink
this
whole
affair
was
becoming
more
complicated
every
minute
that
point
being
cleared
up
then
the
dean
was
re
marking
quietly
mr
nathan
parker
arrived
in
leeds
and
and
lived
at
my
uncle
clay
brock
s
hotel
continued
elise
dryly
the
interruptions
seeming
to
have
dampened
her
enthusiasm
naturally
we
met
and
well
she
hesitated
lowered
her
eyes
shyly
and
groped
her
way
that
s
about
all
there
is
to
it
nat
took
an
interest
in
my
voice
and
arranged
everything
for
my
recital
in
louisville
and
my
grandfather
liked
him
so
jeff
says
her
man
had
been
dead
ten
years
she
could
have
married
again
any
time
but
she
said
she
d
wait
till
her
boys
stepped
off
and
they
need
nt
hurry
on
her
account
she
thought
a
master
sight
of
her
boys
but
some
of
the
church
folks
felt
she
was
leadin
em
wrong
and
they
talked
to
her
about
it
she
told
them
that
if
it
was
right
to
have
and
she
was
goin
to
see
that
her
boys
did
nt
lose
their
chance
ned
paused
to
put
up
a
broom
and
looked
out
of
the
door
tom
jeff
ll
tell
you
the
rest
of
it
ai
nt
this
a
fine
day
for
goin
to
the
river
but
britt
would
nt
let
him
off
you
tell
it
now
do
nt
leave
us
hangin
up
it
do
nt
go
good
rafe
took
the
cramps
or
something
and
was
drowned
all
of
a
sudden
his
mother
fainted
and
was
hours
comin
to
then
she
got
up
and
made
a
big
funeral
for
him
mortgaged
the
place
for
it
car
and
everything
got
the
finest
casket
in
dunmow
and
filled
the
church
with
flowers
paid
a
preacher
with
a
big
name
to
come
up
from
raleigh
he
was
a
man
they
said
who
could
bury
the
devil
and
persuade
god
to
take
him
to
heaven
mrs
starbo
was
afraid
of
the
when
she
answered
them
like
she
did
and
they
d
talked
a
lot
about
her
jollyfyin
with
the
boys
it
might
have
gone
all
right
but
they
got
madder
than
ever
when
she
called
the
big
preacher
in
they
made
up
a
delegation
of
the
best
people
to
meet
him
and
let
him
know
how
it
was
they
told
him
this
wicked
young
man
had
been
called
by
god
as
a
warning
to
all
the
other
young
people
who
were
rushing
to
destruction
if
he
really
wanted
to
do
god
s
work
he
d
preach
a
sermon
that
the
young
people
would
never
forget
and
the
mother
hearin
it
yes
dad
they
told
him
they
d
get
him
to
come
back
and
hold
their
union
revival
in
the
fall
and
they
had
a
lot
of
good
citizens
who
would
see
that
he
was
paid
what
he
ought
to
get
for
his
work
they
told
him
he
need
nt
mind
hurtin
the
mother
s
feelin
s
cause
that
was
the
wrong
and
bring
her
back
to
god
if
a
boy
could
live
like
rafe
starbo
and
then
get
the
biggest
funeral
that
ever
was
in
the
country
except
old
senator
renfrow
s
the
church
might
as
well
go
out
of
business
they
put
it
a
little
different
to
him
i
reckon
but
that
s
what
they
meant
and
the
preacher
said
leave
it
to
him
he
d
take
care
of
it
ishma
felt
that
she
could
nt
listen
any
longer
knowing
what
was
coming
but
britt
must
have
the
end
of
it
tom
jeff
said
it
was
a
terrible
sermon
he
said
it
made
even
the
old
christians
that
already
had
their
haloes
ordered
shake
in
their
seats
he
opened
hell
right
there
in
the
middle
of
the
church
and
put
rafe
starbo
into
it
with
all
the
flowers
and
ribbons
and
fine
casket
he
could
talk
tom
jeff
said
the
girls
faces
were
all
smeared
with
tears
and
their
hats
fallin
off
the
boys
mother
s
face
was
a
pale
remonstrance
oh
how
could
they
would
nobody
stop
him
that
poor
mother
and
it
drove
her
crazy
not
like
you
think
she
looked
mad
at
first
like
she
was
goin
to
fly
at
the
preacher
and
kill
him
but
when
he
went
onshe
got
still
and
white
and
at
last
she
began
to
believe
him
and
fell
in
a
faint
worse
than
the
one
she
had
when
rafe
was
drowned
she
did
nt
know
anything
till
next
morning
the
preacher
stayed
over
cause
he
said
she
d
wake
up
converted
and
want
to
see
him
and
she
did
just
like
he
said
she
sent
for
him
and
he
sat
by
her
and
told
her
she
was
saved
that
god
had
worked
this
wonderful
plan
to
save
souls
and
it
was
up
to
her
now
to
see
that
her
other
boy
went
right
and
help
all
the
young
people
in
the
community
and
that
s
why
poor
old
ern
has
to
go
jeff
says
ishma
was
too
angry
to
cry
and
she
sits
there
by
the
windowlooking
at
his
grave
all
the
time
except
when
she
s
asleep
and
sometimes
she
sleeps
all
night
by
the
window
when
she
s
got
her
eyes
on
his
grave
she
can
feel
more
like
he
s
there
and
not
in
hell
it
seems
to
help
her
a
little
she
sits
there
with
her
bible
in
her
lap
starin
out
at
the
grave
she
had
his
body
taken
up
and
his
grave
made
on
the
hill
where
she
could
look
at
it
his
mother
had
risen
i
m
going
to
see
her
i
m
going
right
now
ned
caught
her
hands
no
do
nt
mother
you
ca
nt
do
a
thing
for
her
i
saw
her
when
she
looks
at
you
your
blood
runs
cold
and
you
ca
nt
say
a
thing
you
get
away
as
quick
as
you
can
and
wish
there
really
was
it
forever
and
ever
do
nt
go
today
mother
we
re
going
to
the
bridge
you
promised
she
assented
i
ll
not
go
to
see
her
today
but
soon
she
moved
to
the
door
as
if
about
to
run
from
something
let
s
go
into
the
garden
but
when
they
were
out
she
left
britt
and
ned
and
went
on
through
the
orchard
then
up
the
little
rise
of
land
to
where
she
could
see
the
rolling
green
rye
the
dark
stirring
woods
the
fields
beyond
the
fringe
of
river
and
get
back
her
wide
escaping
world
it
s
hard
on
old
ern
britt
said
soberly
to
ned
they
lost
asked
him
to
go
i
heard
her
he
had
nt
wanted
to
go
but
he
had
gone
he
had
nt
wanted
to
drink
whisky
but
he
had
drunk
it
when
they
dared
him
yet
he
was
always
like
that
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
his
mother
had
whipped
him
for
playing
with
toby
waters
he
had
stood
it
without
a
whimper
and
as
soon
as
it
was
and
over
the
fields
to
the
pigsty
that
was
what
father
called
ralph
s
need
to
defend
his
personality
his
whole
childhood
father
said
had
been
warped
by
forces
he
did
not
understand
though
he
felt
they
were
destructive
but
perhaps
grandmother
was
right
when
she
insisted
that
she
did
nt
hold
with
such
newfangled
ideas
and
willful
children
should
be
made
to
obey
then
without
effort
as
soon
as
she
had
stopped
trying
to
think
things
out
clearly
ada
began
to
live
over
all
that
had
happened
or
had
not
happened
to
turn
eager
expectancy
into
vague
disappointment
a
few
hours
before
in
the
evening
life
had
been
simple
and
straight
and
now
at
midnight
it
was
ruffled
and
complicated
and
obscured
by
this
smoky
vapor
of
apprehension
and
she
had
wanted
life
to
be
simple
she
had
asked
nothing
more
than
a
certain
security
for
her
life
for
her
love
for
her
happiness
they
were
on
the
back
seat
in
the
big
wagon
charlie
draper
and
willie
be
waiting
for
them
on
the
rowans
porch
when
they
started
down
the
rocky
road
the
single
heart
ralph
put
his
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
in
the
darkness
she
remembered
the
warm
pressure
of
his
mouth
on
hers
and
she
remembered
too
the
roll
of
the
wheels
turning
within
and
without
and
the
yellow
gleam
from
the
wagon
lamp
flitting
over
the
tufts
of
grass
and
weeds
which
stood
out
illuminated
each
blade
or
leaf
separate
and
distinct
on
the
edge
of
obscurity
later
moonlight
would
pour
down
over
the
hills
into
the
valleys
but
while
they
drove
on
past
the
churchyard
into
the
village
they
were
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
it
was
a
tender
darkness
soft
warm
clinging
not
like
this
burned
out
silver
light
which
seemed
to
drain
the
world
and
her
own
mind
of
emotion
i
had
hoped
we
were
going
alone
he
murmured
as
she
lived
the
evening
over
again
she
laughed
from
sheer
delight
it
was
your
go
with
janet
is
it
true
that
some
of
the
boys
went
up
to
lightning
ridge
to
buy
moonshine
he
nodded
who
told
you
that
it
was
exactly
like
janet
i
do
nt
care
so
long
as
you
were
nt
one
of
them
she
replied
ignoring
his
question
the
arm
she
leaned
against
hardened
slightly
a
man
ca
nt
be
a
killjoy
he
answered
that
is
what
you
and
your
father
can
never
understand
it
is
easy
to
be
noble
in
the
woods
but
among
other
people
it
makes
you
a
kill
joy
his
tone
had
roughened
and
in
some
strange
way
the
roughness
increased
his
power
over
her
she
felt
ecstasy
stabbing
through
her
flesh
into
her
heart
piercing
every
cell
of
her
body
with
tiny
splinters
of
flame
why
why
she
could
nt
tell
she
did
nt
know
it
was
nothing
that
he
had
vein
of
ironsaid
only
the
eager
seeking
of
his
lips
and
the
ruffled
thrilling
charm
of
his
mouth
his
eyes
his
smile
his
imperative
tone
and
gestures
seemed
to
envelop
her
and
crush
out
resistance
yes
it
was
true
you
could
not
live
in
the
world
and
be
a
killjoy
how
she
loved
him
what
a
miracle
love
can
make
of
life
nothing
else
mattered
not
janet
not
moonshine
whisky
not
being
alone
in
a
crowd
then
as
they
stopped
before
the
rowans
gate
she
whispered
i
hope
you
will
be
nice
to
janet
she
could
feel
and
see
too
when
a
light
flashed
from
the
porch
that
he
was
smiling
oh
no
you
do
nt
he
retorted
you
do
nt
really
before
she
had
time
to
answer
janet
and
bessie
were
calling
to
them
as
they
ran
down
the
walk
and
the
three
boys
jumped
out
of
the
wagon
and
flung
open
the
gate
charlie
held
up
a
lantern
and
the
light
danced
over
janet
on
her
neck
she
was
so
lovely
that
ada
caught
her
breath
as
she
looked
at
her
oh
is
nt
she
beautiful
does
nt
her
dress
suit
her
to
her
astonishment
ralph
was
not
looking
he
had
turned
away
and
was
fumbling
with
the
reins
that
had
dropped
from
the
wagon
even
when
they
had
all
crowded
into
the
wagon
and
were
driving
up
the
street
ralph
did
not
turn
his
eyes
from
the
broad
backs
of
the
grays
he
did
not
speak
until
janet
leaned
over
and
touched
his
arm
then
he
looked
at
her
and
looked
away
again
before
he
replied
to
some
trivial
question
she
possessed
some
power
ada
felt
that
ralph
despised
and
resisted
but
could
neither
ignore
nor
deny
a
boy
brought
up
so
severely
would
always
retain
some
secret
allegiance
to
duty
grandmother
said
no
matter
how
far
he
wandered
even
if
his
senses
fell
into
the
single
heart
sin
his
conscience
would
always
remind
him
that
it
was
not
pleasure
but
sin
to
be
rooted
more
in
aversion
than
in
attraction
ada
wondered
whether
aunt
meggie
had
meant
this
when
she
called
janet
a
born
trouble
maker
somewhere
in
the
fields
a
hound
was
howling
the
small
darkened
light
still
shone
like
a
vindictive
eye
in
mrs
waters
s
hovel
was
the
woman
ill
or
in
want
perhaps
toby
was
sick
tomorrow
she
must
tell
grandmother
or
aunt
meggie
aunt
meggie
had
told
her
not
to
bother
about
mother
s
salt
rising
bread
which
had
to
be
put
down
at
four
o
clock
for
a
third
rising
no
matter
how
early
she
went
downstairs
grandmother
who
never
slept
a
wink
after
the
first
crack
of
day
was
hopelessly
in
her
power
he
hungered
for
a
great
clean
freedom
but
he
was
a
man
in
jail
pouring
whisky
upon
his
curse
harboring
plots
for
his
own
destruction
fetching
up
night
after
night
at
the
same
dead
end
only
once
during
all
his
months
here
did
he
try
to
break
free
he
drove
with
bill
and
madge
and
another
girl
into
the
country
bill
and
vridar
watched
them
leave
the
road
and
crawl
through
a
fence
and
disappear
behind
a
grove
of
trees
then
he
turned
to
maxine
allen
a
sour
girl
with
red
hair
and
put
his
arms
around
her
but
she
was
like
a
woman
of
lead
when
he
touched
her
breast
though
she
swung
to
him
in
fury
and
slapped
his
face
and
for
a
little
while
he
was
too
astonished
to
move
what
the
hell
s
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
you
leave
me
alone
do
nt
you
dare
touch
me
what
are
you
out
here
for
do
nt
you
touch
me
he
grasped
her
arms
and
shook
her
you
idiot
he
cried
furiously
the
girl
moved
to
escape
but
he
broke
her
across
his
lap
and
she
was
strangely
quiet
as
he
held
her
face
to
moonlight
it
was
a
face
almost
distorted
with
passion
do
nt
she
said
i
m
not
that
kind
of
i
do
nt
like
you
i
would
nt
do
anything
with
you
her
quiet
scorn
infuriated
him
he
shook
her
again
and
she
wailed
with
violent
hands
he
shuttled
her
back
and
forth
and
from
side
to
side
and
she
did
not
resist
now
she
was
limp
and
helpless
and
he
knew
that
she
liked
to
be
manhandled
but
he
did
not
understand
and
when
overcome
again
by
amazement
he
stopped
to
meditate
she
swung
and
struck
his
face
she
kicked
wildly
at
his
legs
and
yanked
his
hair
what
s
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
we
are
betrayedhe
crushed
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
car
and
then
dragged
her
up
his
hands
like
steel
on
her
naked
arms
and
again
she
was
limp
against
him
and
her
mouth
kissed
his
throat
but
the
moment
he
paused
in
his
violence
in
his
experimental
attempt
to
rend
her
flesh
and
break
her
limbs
she
was
at
him
again
her
hands
like
wild
things
in
his
face
left
him
speechlessand
he
crawled
out
of
the
car
and
stared
at
the
girl
her
mouth
was
strangely
savage
and
so
were
her
eyes
and
what
sort
of
person
she
was
he
could
not
imagine
he
left
her
sitting
here
and
walked
back
to
town
and
the
more
he
learned
during
these
months
the
more
he
was
lost
in
bewilderment
the
riddle
of
life
was
darker
moving
week
after
week
among
the
outcasts
studying
them
eager
to
know
what
lay
in
their
hearts
he
saw
them
as
animals
feeding
their
appetites
and
exploiting
one
another
and
this
city
he
reflected
was
like
other
cities
and
these
people
the
respectable
and
the
outcasts
were
like
people
everywhere
they
were
lost
in
an
undecipherable
grammar
of
struggle
and
greed
there
was
no
grandeur
here
no
idealism
like
acid
upon
the
dross
no
chastity
that
was
not
cowardice
no
pride
that
was
not
arrogant
and
mean
and
between
the
two
groups
the
respectable
who
stood
in
sunlight
and
little
difference
he
had
seen
harlots
give
to
beggars
he
had
seen
bill
rummon
moist
of
eye
quavering
of
tongue
rebuke
a
lout
who
had
taunted
shorty
duff
he
had
seen
lawyers
perjure
themselves
and
their
clients
and
he
had
seen
a
churchman
steal
and
he
had
seen
a
bootlegger
help
an
old
woman
across
the
street
and
he
himself
had
felt
at
times
a
dark
murderous
lusting
or
hatred
of
the
male
for
the
male
or
wonder
childlike
and
suffering
for
the
lewd
and
unclean
meanings
in
the
meaningless
or
a
wish
deep
and
dark
in
its
sickness
to
give
his
life
to
make
the
world
good
in
books
human
beings
were
not
as
he
found
them
now
in
books
right
was
right
and
wrong
waswe
are
betrayed
swrong
the
hero
was
a
splendid
fellow
with
his
thoughts
always
in
the
upper
half
of
his
torso
and
the
villain
was
a
monstrous
wickedness
who
came
to
a
bad
end
and
he
was
sick
of
his
life
here
but
there
him
to
pastures
where
growth
was
clean
this
needed
a
power
beyond
his
own
will
in
a
night
of
august
and
in
a
terrible
day
that
followed
that
power
came
xviibill
rummon
came
to
him
at
midnight
he
wanted
to
go
to
pocatello
he
said
and
when
vridar
went
to
his
taxi
he
saw
that
madge
eppert
was
already
there
you
going
too
he
asked
sure
i
m
going
she
said
vridar
roared
out
upon
the
highway
and
this
midnight
ride
in
a
blinding
downpour
was
the
most
reckless
of
all
his
journeys
in
a
car
he
could
barely
see
through
the
glass
the
road
was
a
faintly
luminous
streak
of
light
but
he
pushed
the
gas
lever
clear
to
the
floor
and
the
car
under
him
was
a
mad
thing
roaring
through
the
storm
in
a
little
while
he
saw
the
wan
lights
of
blackfoot
like
matches
in
a
fog
and
then
in
a
moment
of
terror
he
saw
that
the
highway
swung
in
a
right
stop
and
his
speed
was
too
great
for
the
turn
he
went
straight
ahead
with
terrific
power
and
there
was
a
sound
of
flying
stone
and
of
sand
in
a
whirlwind
he
and
rummon
got
out
in
downpour
the
car
had
driven
into
a
great
pile
of
sand
and
gravel
and
had
buried
itself
to
the
steel
frame
and
every
wheel
was
spinning
and
after
they
had
spent
two
hours
digging
out
of
this
mound
vridar
lost
the
highway
and
plowed
through
the
mud
of
a
country
lane
came
to
a
halt
on
a
high
bank
with
the
car
rocking
under
him
got
out
to
explore
and
fell
headlong
she
was
smart
with
the
smartness
of
a
woman
who
had
been
around
in
the
world
and
had
suffered
somewhat
from
the
contact
yet
it
was
her
body
that
remained
her
chief
asset
the
tightness
of
the
gown
and
the
way
the
light
reflected
from
the
metal
cloth
accentuated
the
mounds
of
her
breasts
and
reminded
him
that
it
was
this
body
dancing
in
the
front
row
of
a
musical
comedy
chorus
that
had
attracted
him
he
was
aware
of
it
now
well
she
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
and
he
realized
that
she
was
watching
him
with
a
tolerant
half
amused
gaze
he
colored
slightly
but
spoke
doggedly
of
the
idea
which
was
again
foremost
in
his
mind
why
not
call
it
off
a
divorce
will
hestor
murdock
stiffened
slightly
i
was
enjoying
myself
she
said
irritably
and
her
eyes
were
sulky
you
pick
a
nice
time
to
bring
that
up
the
way
it
is
you
may
not
always
be
so
well
satisfied
it
will
be
time
enough
then
she
started
to
get
up
murdock
reached
out
and
without
pushing
kept
her
from
rising
he
said
wait
she
did
not
force
the
issue
instead
she
settled
herself
again
puffed
lazily
at
her
cigarette
and
watched
him
through
the
blue
haze
that
hung
between
them
to
hestor
kent
murdock
was
a
paradox
he
was
hard
yet
mixed
with
this
hardness
was
a
certain
refinement
of
feeling
that
she
could
not
understand
he
was
intelligent
well
educated
yet
he
was
a
newspaper
photographer
and
he
liked
his
job
she
hated
him
yet
she
liked
him
even
now
he
was
attractive
to
her
good
looking
with
a
knack
of
wearing
clothes
well
he
had
a
masculine
vitality
that
had
found
a
responsive
chord
in
her
from
the
first
their
marriage
had
been
a
mistake
but
she
did
not
regret
it
what
was
that
she
could
not
hold
him
not
that
it
mattered
she
was
better
off
now
much
better
off
his
weekly
payments
added
to
what
she
made
with
her
radio
program
enabled
her
to
live
as
she
had
dreamed
of
living
in
her
burlesque
days
and
she
had
told
herself
this
before
this
marriage
was
only
an
experiment
an
expedient
rather
she
had
known
girls
in
the
chorus
who
had
married
well
profitably
such
had
been
her
intention
to
wait
until
she
could
be
sure
of
the
financial
success
of
such
a
venture
if
she
could
have
the
thrill
of
it
at
the
same
time
so
much
the
better
but
given
the
security
she
could
find
other
outlets
for
a
nature
high
strung
with
passion
circumstances
changed
her
plans
decisively
when
love
song
opened
in
boston
an
immediate
marriage
had
no
place
in
hestor
s
thoughts
but
when
it
closed
on
saturday
night
after
a
week
s
try
out
and
the
company
disbanded
she
had
seized
the
only
chance
cigarette
to
her
mouth
she
did
not
seize
it
she
made
that
chance
she
had
met
kent
murdock
at
a
party
after
the
opening
performance
on
the
preceding
monday
she
liked
him
and
she
encouraged
him
during
that
week
he
had
taken
her
out
nearly
every
night
after
the
performance
yet
she
had
no
false
ideas
about
his
interest
he
wanted
a
good
time
he
had
sufficient
money
to
spend
she
made
herself
good
company
but
she
had
experienced
that
sort
of
thing
before
when
the
show
moved
on
the
affair
would
be
forgotten
only
this
time
the
show
would
not
move
on
and
at
the
time
she
had
her
rent
paid
in
new
york
for
a
month
and
little
else
the
show
business
was
in
the
doldrums
there
were
no
angels
no
suitable
offers
of
marriage
in
sight
she
remembered
that
saturday
night
the
show
closed
they
d
had
supper
after
the
performance
and
gone
on
to
a
speak
easy
she
had
taken
the
reins
from
her
affection
a
little
she
remembered
and
it
had
been
she
who
suggested
they
get
married
after
she
was
sure
that
the
half
dozen
drinks
and
her
methods
had
made
him
forget
any
resolve
or
inhibition
about
her
he
may
have
had
sober
his
voice
checked
her
thoughts
abruptly
i
m
perfectly
willing
to
keep
on
paying
you
as
alimony
hestor
murdock
ground
out
her
cigarette
in
an
ashtray
what
she
drawled
is
the
reason
for
the
rush
rush
murdock
scowled
wrinkles
into
the
bridge
of
his
nose
we
ve
been
separated
over
a
year
i
ve
asked
you
before
i
know
but
casually
maybe
you
ve
lined
up
number
two
murdock
waited
a
moment
before
he
answered
when
he
continued
his
voice
was
level
there
s
no
one
else
the
point
is
i
want
to
know
where
i
stand
we
made
a
mess
of
things
we
both
may
want
another
chance
some
irritation
rising
again
as
she
reflected
how
she
could
not
hold
him
the
marriage
was
an
expedient
yes
but
with
murdock
because
his
virile
hardness
had
attracted
her
she
had
looked
upon
the
venture
with
some
excitement
it
was
to
be
a
thrill
and
into
marriage
she
had
brought
a
magnificent
body
a
well
sexed
nature
and
nothing
at
all
of
the
giveand
take
attitude
to
her
it
was
a
physical
sexual
thing
that
and
nothing
more
murdock
had
failed
her
there
she
knew
that
he
looked
with
only
partly
concealed
disdain
upon
her
repeated
demands
and
she
hated
him
for
it
for
the
last
month
of
their
life
together
he
had
not
slept
with
her
and
there
was
no
other
woman
at
the
time
well
she
tightened
her
lips
and
moved
erect
on
the
davenport
let
him
squirm
she
was
in
no
hurry
she
could
be
free
of
him
soon
enough
if
it
became
necessary
meanwhile
she
found
that
her
married
status
helped
her
with
other
men
more
attentive
murdock
knew
he
was
losing
his
plea
he
had
long
since
accepted
his
part
in
the
fiasco
he
did
not
blame
her
for
the
failure
he
had
never
been
quite
sure
who
about
i
was
only
saying
what
bill
said
to
me
danny
said
naively
he
did
only
let
me
get
my
hands
on
him
he
did
the
grandmother
shouted
in
blind
anger
brother
that
is
a
bad
thing
to
say
you
must
not
talk
like
that
the
aunt
said
ooh
let
me
get
these
hands
on
him
i
ll
cut
his
eyes
out
with
a
butcher
knife
the
grandmother
said
well
bill
he
told
me
that
men
pee
into
women
and
that
makes
babies
and
down
on
la
salle
street
a
policeman
found
a
lot
of
boys
doing
that
to
a
little
girl
in
a
barn
and
they
were
all
naked
danny
said
jesus
mary
and
joseph
may
all
your
curses
cripple
him
for
saying
such
things
to
my
grandson
the
grandmother
shrieked
dramatically
sin
and
a
sweet
little
fellow
like
you
must
never
again
say
that
or
your
aunty
and
grandmother
will
have
to
wash
your
mouth
out
with
soap
the
aunt
said
and
while
she
spoke
the
grandmother
rushed
into
her
room
grabbed
the
holy
water
fount
from
her
wall
returned
and
sprinkled
holy
water
around
is
it
a
sin
aunty
margaret
it
s
an
awful
sin
and
it
would
make
you
burn
in
hell
promise
your
aunty
you
ll
never
again
think
or
talk
like
that
i
will
i
was
nt
saying
it
myself
i
was
only
telling
you
what
bill
told
me
and
asking
you
he

i
ll
slit
his

with

the

and

around
the
kitchen

the
grandmother
interrupted
we
got
to
get
the
boy
off
to
school
yes
because

have
catechism
first
and
miss
devlin
says

chop

one
with
a
hatchet
him
saying
things
not
meant
for
the
ears
of
a
baby
the
grandmother
said
as
if
in
prayer
danny
marched
out
of
school
in
his
regular
place
in
line
thinking
how
at
home
they
would
blame
bill
and
tell
uncle
a
i
and
uncle
al
would
sock
bill
and
bill
would
be
sore
at
him
then
and
gee
he
had
nt
meant
to
tell
them
what
he
did
the
words
had
just
slipped
out
of
all
and
now
gosh
how
would
he
be
able
to
make
bill
believe
that
he
had
nt
been
a
snitcher
the
children
marched
out
of
the
small
fenced
in
schoolyard
and
the
line
dispersed
at
the
gate
leading
onto
fiftieth
street
at
the
alley
as
danny
crossed
the
alley
beside
the
schoolyard
there
were
kids
all
around
him
walking
running
talking
shouting
wrestling
artie
lenehan
a
plump
boy
of
seven
who
always
threw
spitballs
and
made
trouble
in
the
schoolroom
came
up
to
him
sissy

artie
said
standing
in
the
center
of
a
gang
of
kids
who
laughed
at
danny
danny
got
mad
he
closed
his
eyes
and
blindly
ripped
into
artie
punching
kicking
scratching
he
fell
forward
with
his
eyes
closed
when
he
opened
them
he
was
on
top
of
artie
screaming
scratching
shouting
for
artie
to
take
back
what
he
had
said
and
artie
was
yelling
murder
and
shouting
that
he
never
would
danny
was
dragged
off
artie
by
a
bigger
kid
he
did
nt
know

m
going
to
tell
my
mother

you
artie
screamed
his
face
scratched
and
bleeding
you
ca
nt
talk
about
my
mother
bad
danny
sobbed
quivering
and
nervous
as
artie
ran
away
still
shouting
danny
walked
home
alone
his
body
shaken
with
sobs
not
knowing
even
if
he
was
walking
the
right
way
he
if
he
was
doing
it
in
his
sleep
walking
up
three
flights
of
stairway
he
tried
not
to
cry
his
grandmother
was
at
the
door
and
she
kissed
him
as
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
son
my
son
you
re
dinner
is
ready
where
were
you
he
walked
ahead
of
her
to
the
kitchen
and
when
she
followed
him
into
it
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
red
from
crying
and
that
his
clothes
were
mussed
son
are
you
hurt
are
you
sick
who
hit
you
no
mudder
a
boy
called
me
a
sissy
the
little
devil
who
is
he
tell
me
and
i
ll
tear
his
mother
s
hair
out
of
her
head
could
see
the
trees
of
the
tank
grove
separate
from
the
buildings
lying
this
side
of
it
it
looked
perfectly
still
there
what
if
they
were
gone
he
began
to
run
a
few
steps
but
he
was
too
tired
and
hungry
to
do
it
long
at
last
he
reached
the
tracks
and
started
up
the
near
embankment
the
low
cindery
hill
his
misery
rose
into
his
mouth
and
he
could
not
help
the
sore
pity
of
his
return
to
the
scene
of
fright
and
torture
sobbing
blindly
he
stumbled
over
the
tracks
down
the
other
side
and
into
the
grove
clearing
where
he
stood
waiting
for
them
to
speak
cried
tom
his
face
was
rivered
with
dried
dusty
marks
of
weeping
but
he
waved
and
grinned
at
danny
oscar
sat
on
the
log
fat
was
asleep
against
a
tree
over
at
the
edge
of
the
grove
you
re
just
in
time
said
oscar
your
friend
here
has
been
lonesome
he
has
been
crying
for
you
i
ca
nt
see
why
i
have
nt
done
anything
have
i
now
he
smiled
narrowly
at
tom
as
if
to
influence
him
to
agreement
no
you
have
nt
oh
i
have
nt
eh
said
oscar
you
do
nt
call
that
anything
well
i
ll
give
you
something
to
remember
no
no
wait
yes
it
was
something
it
was
awful
mister
do
nt
do
nt
do
nt
tom
whimpered
on
his
breath
and
rubbed
his
left
arm
where
it
still
hurt
from
oscar
s
twistings
all
give
it
to
me
danny
opened
his
shirt
and
pulled
forth
the
knotted
handkerchief
he
held
it
out
oscar
took
it
it
was
silent
and
apprehensive
while
oscar
opened
the
handkerchief
and
counted
the
money
he
actually
had
nt
expected
so
much
he
frowned
and
spat
to
hide
his
satisfaction
it
was
going
to
be
fun
with
this
money
when
they
got
to
the
next
town
he
and
fat
only
fat
need
nt
have
a
dime
of
it
the
old
sow
belly
he
looked
sharply
up
thinking
to
dismiss
the
boys
now
that
they
had
served
him
but
he
thought
and
they
could
see
his
thought
run
back
of
his
whitish
narrow
eyes
the
thick
mouthed
discussion
he
made
silently
with
himself
they
drew
together
and
watched
with
pinched
and
staring
faces
certain
that
new
horrors
were
being
planned
he
thought
if
i
let
them
go
they
will
get
somebody
after
me
and
this
money
that
kid
stole
this
money
they
d
find
out
on
the
night
freight
he
looked
up
and
said
you
think
that
s
enough
money
do
you
well
i
ll
show
you
different
you
re
going
to
work
for
me
when
can
we
go
when
i
m
good
and
ready
see
and
if
either
of
you
say
a
word
any
time
about
me
or
what
you
did
today
i
ll
come
back
and
i
ll
kick
the
hell
out
of
you
here
i
ll
take
the
both
of
you
somewhere
where
nobody
ever
ll
hear
of
you
again
and
i
ll
show
you
what
s
what
fat
stirred
and
awoke
a
little
and
murmured
that
he
d
like
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
oscar
swore
obscenely
at
him
then
he
set
the
boys
busy
washing
his
socks
in
the
pool
in
the
ditch
where
he
had
discovered
them
so
long
ago
this
morning
he
made
them
wash
everything
he
had
in
his
roll
of
possessions
the
them
hold
his
clothes
there
to
dry
the
smoke
wavered
and
fanned
into
their
faces
and
into
their
clothes
as
the
dusk
began
to
glimmer
across
the
light
their
spirits
fell
sorely
and
they
felt
abandoned
and
lost
fat
awoke
and
added
twigs
and
leaves
to
the
fire
and
shivered
toward
the
flame
chilled
in
his
shapeless
soul
he
hummed
a
little
tune
he
seemed
to
welcome
evening
and
the
firelight
and
sight
of
the
children
puttering
at
their
woeful
tasks
oscar
sat
sprawled
hugely
against
the
log
dreaming
at
the
wild
party
he
was
going
to
have
on
his
money
when
he
got
somewhere
as
his
spirits
rose
he
felt
hot
blooded
and
his
face
turned
dark
with
flush
and
his
pale
eyes
reddened
and
watered
and
he
told
over
to
himself
what
he
would
do
when
he
got
a
woman
again
and
what
he
had
done
in
the
past
and
what
women
had
made
known
to
him
of
himself
and
of
how
that
knowledge
of
his
power
his
hugeness
his
might
was
what
he
had
and
have
proved
to
him
over
and
over
again
else
he
dimly
feel
himself
defeated
a
creature
powerless
and
wild
yai
hee
he
suddenly
yelled
and
stirred
his
rump
and
his
great
legs
with
lust
he
jumped
up
and
picked
the
boys
away
from
the
fire
where
they
were
waving
his
two
shirts
he
knocked
their
heads
together
and
crushed
their
arms
in
his
grasps
then
he
saw
fat
leaning
over
to
gather
a
few
more
fagots
for
the
fire
and
he
made
a
running
skip
and
kicked
him
and
tumbled
him
to
the
ground
and
now
he
was
calmer
a
little
appeased
he
came
back
and
told
the
boys
they
were
to
be
free
after
the
night
freight
pulled
out
fat
and
i
are
taking
freight
tonight
when
we
re
gone
we
re
gone
you
can
go
home
then
i
ll
be
on
my
way
the
boys
nodded
and
shivered
they
had
very
little
to
think
about
anything
yes
sir
on
my
way
and
am
town
yai
hee
fat
came
into
the
firelight
that
now
fluttered
in
the
increasing
dark
he
was
silent
and
he
was
hurt
but
he
made
no
protest
he
added
his
scrapings
of
bark
and
twig
to
the
fire
and
sighed
heavily
sitting
down
a
little
away
and
alone
the
boys
did
nt
stir
until
the
relief
engine
that
would
take
the
night
freight
out
came
idling
up
the
track
and
crossing
the
horizon
in
their
vision
where
evening
lingered
in
the
lower
sky
and
night
already
the
mental
wreck
you
might
think
when
he
s
sober
oh
yes
he
is
frequently
he
can
sell
big
machinery
steam
shovels
and
things
and
he
does
it
well
he
would
nt
hold
his
job
at
all
if
he
did
nt
produce
so
there
you
are
unlimited
opportunity
a
motive
that
to
his
inflamed
mind
could
easily
be
enough
to
make
him
commit
murder
and
on
top
of
that
proof
that
he
was
there
at
the
time
carrying
a
weapon
what
more
could
you
possibly
ask
for
a
good
i
could
ask
for
a
great
deal
more
the
professor
leaned
back
and
placed
the
finger
tips
of
his
right
hand
firmly
and
precisely
on
the
finger
prints
of
his
left
and
then
he
talked
with
just
as
much
firmness
and
precision
you
re
trying
to
make
it
far
too
simple
my
dear
you
leave
too
many
things
unanswered
i
grant
you
that
this
tale
of
spurrier
s
is
most
interesting
and
sheds
light
in
some
dark
corners
but
it
does
nt
give
us
a
bit
of
proof
on
the
identity
of
the
murderer
spurrier
might
have
seen
a
dozen
men
with
everything
from
automatics
to
sawed
off
blunderbusses
in
their
hands
but
it
would
nt
mean
that
there
was
nt
a
thirteenth
man
around
somewhere
who
did
the
dirty
work
let
s
assume
for
a
minute
that
it
was
barton
on
the
stairs
with
a
gun
in
his
right
hand
which
i
do
nt
believe
to
be
true
then
according
to
your
theory
he
would
have
waited
a
floor
before
proceeding
that
right
i
suppose
so
said
harriett
then
what
then
barton
would
have
continued
on
to
the
seventh
floor
entered
this
office
shot
mr
grayson
dropped
the
gun
to
the
floor
walked
out
and
gone
about
his
affairs
is
that
what
you
want
me
to
believe
yes
what
about
it
what
makes
it
so
hard
to
swallow
it
just
wo
nt
do
that
s
all
well
then
let
s
have
your
version
my
dear
girl
i
have
no
version
all
i
say
is
that
alexander
barton
is
no
more
of
a
murderer
than
he
is
a
prohibitionist
barton
was
thoroughly
tight
that
night
matt
said
his
men
were
almost
knocked
down
by
his
breath
when
they
found
him
later
in
his
office
now
drunken
men
do
nt
stand
with
one
foot
in
the
air
as
spurrier
said
he
saw
they
do
nt
stand
no
man
alive
whether
drunk
or
sober
ever
holds
a
gun
ready
for
action
in
his
right
hand
if
he
s
left
handed
spurrier
seemed
to
be
rather
definite
that
it
was
the
right
hand
and
alexander
barton
is
left
handed
or
had
nt
you
noticed
how
do
you
know
he
s
left
handed
demanded
harriett
she
was
not
going
to
forsake
her
brain
child
without
a
struggle
i
ll
give
you
three
guesses
harry
how
would
i
know
it
how
for
instance
can
i
tell
that
you
are
very
pretty
and
brown
haired
and
just
tall
enough
to
come
up
to
the
bottom
of
my
ear
which
means
i
suppose
said
she
that
you
have
talked
with
barton
if
so
why
beat
around
the
bush
so
and
especially
why
get
so
personal
wells
shrugged
and
waved
his
hands
expressively
i
like
getting
personal
with
you
i
hope
you
do
nt
mind
it
does
things
to
me
but
seriously
yes
i
have
talked
with
barton
at
his
home
i
thought
he
d
be
more
at
ease
there
than
here
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
ve
talked
with
a
good
many
people
george
clark
for
instance
and
mary
janowski
the
charwoman
and
the
policeman
who
was
on
duty
around
here
that
night
and
any
number
of
others
i
ve
pried
and
peered
into
the
most
intimate
souls
of
various
good
citizens
and
what
have
i
to
show
for
it
nothing
not
even
one
decent
grade
b
slightly
shopworn
clue
tough
is
nt
it
for
a
whole
day
s
work
then
said
harriett
suddenly
repentant
you
did
nt
desert
the
cause
yesterday
after
all
did
you
no
harry
i
did
nt
did
you
think
i
had
i
i
did
nt
know
what
to
think
mr
wells
the
front
name
in
case
shortened
to
cliff
by
impertinent
people
do
you
think
you
could
remember
it
or
should
i
write
it
down
for
you
do
you
have
these
attacks
often
only
about
once
in
a
lifetime
let
s
hear
you
say
it
we
re
getting
too
far
from
the
reservation
said
harriett
briskly
let
s
turn
back
you
said
i
was
trying
to
make
this
case
too
simple
why
do
you
say
that
because
it
is
nt
simple
at
all
harry
consider
these
points
why
should
mr
grayson
be
killed
so
soon
after
changing
his
will
is
it
a
mere
coincidence
or
is
it
something
else
what
was
he
watching
for
the
night
he
was
killed
it
must
have
been
something
outside
the
building
or
he
would
nt
have
needed
the
opera
glasses
but
it
must
also
have
been
something
fairly
close
or
he
would
have
needed
stronger
glasses
who
killed
john
blann
was
the
murder
of
john
or
was
it
another
coincidence
maybe
of
course
it
was
neither
it
may
have
been
a
necessity
brought
about
by
whatever
blann
happened
to
discover
that
night
but
then
what
did
blann
discover
you
see
i
m
asking
a
good
many
questions
do
you
think
alexander
barton
could
answer
any
of
them
do
you
still
think
he
s
a
murderer
as
well
as
a
drunkard
harriett
considered
then
no
i
do
nt
he
he
s
not
the
man
now
you
re
being
reasonable
harry
said
wells
filling
and
lighting
his
pipe
thoughtfully
then
he
said
but
i
have
another
question
for
you
this
is
one
that
worries
me
a
good
deal
you
will
remember
from
grayson
s
manuscript
that
it
worried
mattingly
for
a
while
too
but
then
he
seems
to
have
forgotten
it
the
question
is
why
was
bond
grayson
a
half
a
piece
it
is
nt
that
she
said
but
it
s
so
much
nicer
in
the
fifty
cent
seats
high
up
in
the
stadium
you
mean
way
up
there
on
those
stone
seats
she
nodded
it
s
not
as
comfortable
as
the
ones
downstairs
she
said
but
they
re
not
as
uncomfortable
as
they
look
and
it
s
really
much
more
well
sort
of
private
but
it
does
nt
matter
if
you
have
these
already
why
just
a
moment
i
said
i
took
the
tickets
out
of
my
pocket
gutter
oh
she
said
you
should
nt
why
not
i
said
remembering
to
kick
myself
i
do
nt
like
that
kind
of
cheap
flash
no
sense
in
sitting
out
in
the
open
like
an
actor
on
a
stage
with
the
whole
world
staring
at
you
i
should
ve
had
more
sense
than
to
buy
those
tickets
anyway
come
on
we
ll
get
a
couple
of
those
other
tickets
there
was
quite
a
crowd
going
in
when
i
stopped
to
buy
two
of
the
cheaper
tickets
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
there
were
that
many
people
in
the
world
who
were
willing
to
spend
money
to
sit
on
stone
steps
and
listen
to
music
well
and
i
guess
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
d
be
one
of
them
either
let
s
go
over
toward
this
end
she
said
leading
me
toward
the
left
we
can
climb
up
to
the
top
row
there
and
it
wo
nt
down
and
toward
the
right
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
this
place
do
nt
you
i
said
oh
i
come
here
pretty
often
she
said
alone
i
asked
she
blushed
and
i
was
sorry
i
d
asked
sometimes
she
said
awkwardly
sometimes
with
some
other
girls
or
some
hold
it
a
second
i
said
i
want
to
get
a
couple
of
these
i
bought
two
straw
mats
from
a
boy
that
was
selling
them
and
we
continued
to
climb
the
wide
cement
steps
you
do
nt
really
need
them
she
said
it
s
just
as
comfortablesitting
on
the
stone
i
suppose
i
said
but
i
could
nt
imagine
her
sitting
on
anything
so
hard
and
not
hurting
herself
seriously
this
ought
to
be
about
right
she
said
finally
and
i
spread
the
mats
on
the
cement
step
and
we
sat
the
right
of
us
it
was
getting
dark
quickly
but
there
was
still
enough
light
to
see
the
tiers
arranged
like
the
rays
from
a
flashlight
and
how
crowded
they
were
down
below
at
the
focus
of
the
rays
was
the
orchestra
with
the
men
tuning
their
instruments
the
sky
was
blue
with
a
few
stars
beginning
to
show
and
a
handful
of
clouds
moving
across
it
slowly
i
had
nt
looked
at
the
sky
for
a
month
somehow
you
get
out
of
the
habit
downtown
it
s
nice
is
nt
it
she
said
i
nodded
and
looked
around
at
the
people
near
us
most
of
them
were
couples
of
about
our
own
age
they
were
sitting
very
close
to
one
another
and
were
whispering
and
holding
hands
and
laughing
for
all
the
world
as
though
they
were
alone
up
there
and
none
of
them
paid
any
attention
to
the
others
i
considered
it
a
good
sign
they
had
sense
just
as
the
music
started
she
turned
to
me
suddenly
you
but
i
forgot
in
all
the
excitement
about
the
tickets
what
was
it
you
meant
when
you
said
to
me
on
the
phone
before
do
nt
ever
say
that
or
something
like
that
it
was
pretty
dark
now
and
the
only
lights
were
down
in
the
center
of
the
stadium
with
the
orchestra
oh
i
guess
i
did
nt
mean
anything
i
said
let
s
just
forget
it
that
marked
another
first
in
my
life
for
once
i
was
afraid
to
say
something
to
a
dame
but
you
must
have
she
said
looking
at
me
i
could
tell
by
the
way
you
said
it
all
of
a
sudden
well
i
ll
tell
you
i
said
i
do
nt
know
if
i
can
exactly
tell
you
what
i
mean
and
then
again
i
added
maybe
you
wo
nt
like
it
so
suppose
we
skip
the
whole
thing
please
she
said
i
d
rather
you
told
me
it
was
the
first
time
she
d
called
me
by
my
given
name
and
the
way
she
said
it
made
the
skin
and
the
little
hairs
on
the
side
of
my
jaw
stand
up
and
tingle
well
at
least
i
could
say
she
had
better
manners
than
babushkin
well
it
s
like
this
i
said
maybe
i
do
nt
know
you
long
enough
to
go
around
telling
you
these
things
but
hell
the
way
i
figure
i
figure
it
s
important
so
do
nt
get
sore
or
anything
like
that
okay
i
promise
she
said
smiling
and
i
was
sure
she
meant
it
all
right
i
said
now
do
nt
ask
me
for
explanations
or
anything
like
that
because
i
ca
nt
give
them
to
you
all
i
know
is
there
s
something
about
you
let
s
say
about
the
way
they
put
your
you
sit
and
walk
and
even
talk
i
heard
it
on
the
phone
to
night
there
s
something
there
that
s
sort
of
soft
and
well
i
guess
honest
is
the
best
word
anyway
that
s
the
general
idea
see
and
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
my
mother
and
any
girl
that
can
do
that
i
mean
remind
me
of
my
mother
must
be
pretty
good
you
follow
me
she
nodded
a
little
quickly
without
looking
at
me
now
i
continued
this
is
where
it
gets
a
little
thick
but
it
s
the
best
i
can
do
in
the
way
of
an
explanation
i
mean
if
you
only
let
yourself
alone
if
you
only
act
natural
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
you
re
all
right
you
ca
nt
go
wrong
anything
you
say
or
do
any
huh
you
ve
gagged
him
that
s
the
way
it
goes
sometimes
but
to
an
explosive
suggestion
from
brissenden
the
inspector
objected
not
a
chance
look
at
his
mouth
he
d
wear
out
a
squad
he
did
wear
out
sherwood
he
did
no
more
talking
the
attorney
fired
questions
at
him
tried
to
browbeat
him
reasoned
with
him
but
cramer
was
right
de
roode
had
been
gagged
he
said
arrest
me
or
said
nothing
not
even
bothering
to
shake
his
head
finally
the
attorney
told
the
trooper
take
him
out
and
have
one
of
the
men
keep
him
de
roode
you
re
being
held
as
a
material
witness
do
nt
let
anybody
talk
to
him
send
chisholm
in
brissenden
watched
them
go
and
then
growled
be
alive
now
and
we
would
have
got
it
out
of
him
today
i
say
that
talbot
ought
to
take
that
bird
down
to
the
barracks
and
work
on
him
i
want
it
on
record
that
i
say
that
okay
sherwood
gulped
his
cup
of
coffee
now
lukewarm
i
m
not
trying
to
make
a
record
i
m
trying
to
stop
this
damn
massacre
he
poured
hot
coffee
and
sipped
at
that
he
can
take
him
later
if
it
looks
that
way
first
let
s
see
what
we
ve
got
what
we
have
nt
got
is
motive
and
we
ca
nt
get
a
line
on
any
why
in
the
name
of
god
would
de
roode
want
to
murder
p
l
storrs
or
foltz
or
even
chisholm
we
have
a
motive
for
ranth
but
where
would
zimmerman
fit
into
that
and
if
de
roode
did
hear
zimmerman
lock
the
door
how
did
ranth
get
in
the
room
if
de
roode
did
it
himself
why
did
he
and
why
did
he
kill
zimmerman
and
why
the
devil
did
he
kill
storrs
and
if
the
two
jobs
were
done
by
different
people
who
were
they
and
why
did
they
do
it
sherwood
glared
at
dol
what
about
it
miss
bonner
how
are
the
ideas
coming
you
wanted
to
know
why
i
sent
for
de
roode
because
he
heard
zimmerman
lock
his
door
how
do
you
like
that
but
dol
had
no
opportunity
to
tell
how
she
liked
it
len
chisholm
came
in
from
the
standpoint
of
elegance
he
was
a
wreck
dol
looking
at
him
thought
they
might
at
least
have
brushed
some
of
the
cigarette
ashes
off
of
him
his
tie
was
on
one
side
his
shirt
needed
tucking
in
and
his
face
was
either
comic
or
heroic
as
it
might
move
you
with
a
desperate
dignity
he
ignored
the
men
and
squinted
at
dol
oh
so
there
there
you
are
meant
it
for
a
friendly
question
dol
said
nothing
he
frowned
at
her
gave
her
up
and
turned
to
the
men
my
god
are
you
fellows
still
here
he
pointed
an
accusing
finger
not
too
steady
at
cramer
who
was
in
the
chair
maguire
of
bridgeport
had
occupied
twelve
hours
before
you
ve
been
monkeying
with
your
nose
it
s
not
the
same
nose
at
all
o
you
know
cyrano
de
bergerac
let
s
hear
you
say
it
cyrano
de
bergerac
he
abruptly
shifted
to
sherwood
mind
if
i
sit
down
cramer
grunted
in
disgust
you
might
as
well
ask
questions
of
a
weegie
board
is
this
the
one
your
man
found
knocking
on
zimmerman
s
door
yeah
and
the
one
who
saw
storrs
asleep
on
the
bench
saturday
afternoon
huh
he
gets
around
cramer
chewed
on
his
cigar
and
watched
len
s
elaborate
performance
of
lowering
himself
into
a
he
s
good
if
you
let
him
sleep
it
off
he
ll
claim
he
ca
nt
remember
anything
if
you
duck
him
he
ll
have
a
fit
sherwood
stared
at
len
look
here
chisholm
do
you
know
what
your
name
is
certainly
len
smiled
at
him
indulgently
do
you
how
drunk
are
you
well
len
s
brow
wrinkled
i
ll
tell
you
i
m
too
drunk
to
drive
a
car
i
ve
got
too
much
sense
but
i
m
not
too
drunk
to
know
where
i
am
i
know
exactly
where
i
am
that
s
fine
sherwood
sounded
encouraging
then
you
probably
know
where
you
ve
been
too
for
instance
when
you
went
to
zimmerman
s
room
what
did
you
do
in
there
len
shook
his
head
emphatically
you
must
mean
my
room
you
re
mixed
up
you
must
mean
what
did
i
mean
zimmerman
s
room
the
one
around
the
corner
from
yours
in
the
other
hall
more
than
two
hours
ago
you
went
there
in
the
dark
and
knocked
on
the
door
remember
and
the
trooper
came
up
and
spoke
to
you
and
you
told
him
you
thought
it
was
miss
bonner
s
room
and
before
the
trooper
came
you
turned
the
knob
of
that
door
to
open
it
that
s
why
you
ought
to
be
able
to
remember
whether
the
door
was
locked
just
concentrate
on
that
was
the
door
locked
len
looked
cunning
and
superior
he
waved
a
hand
i
see
what
you
re
doing
you
re
trying
to
get
me
top
compromise
miss
bonner
it
s
a
fallacy
if
miss
bonner
s
door
was
locked
how
would
zimmerman
get
in
he
frowned
that
s
not
what
i
mean
i
mean
how
would
i
get
in
and
i
did
nt
get
in
that
s
why
i
say
you
must
mean
my
room
i
sure
you
did
but
that
door
you
were
knocking
on
when
you
tried
to
open
it
was
it
locked
len
shook
his
head
you
do
nt
understand
anything
there
would
nt
be
any
use
trying
to
open
a
door
if
it
was
locked
it
would
nt
do
you
any
good
okay
sherwood
sighed
he
leaned
forward
and
demanded
abruptly
what
did
you
have
against
zimmerman
why
did
you
hate
him
hate
who
steve
zimmerman
oh
him
len
nodded
that
runt
why
did
you
hate
him
i
do
nt
know
i
never
stop
to
think
why
when
i
hate
anybody
washed
their
hands
of
the
affair
here
and
there
was
to
be
seen
the
wry
grimace
the
sightless
eye
of
a
man
who
knew
that
in
an
instant
he
would
be
killed
they
went
up
slowly
reached
the
height
again
dead
yankees
lay
thick
but
others
had
sprung
up
to
take
their
places
the
newcomers
fired
with
ease
and
fury
running
down
the
slope
the
confederates
doggedly
sustained
the
fire
and
were
pushing
on
when
a
battery
was
seen
just
moving
into
position
where
the
ridge
turned
the
arrogant
gunners
leaped
from
the
still
bouncing
carriages
slid
to
their
places
and
began
sending
round
after
round
of
grape
into
the
surging
mass
of
besiegers
men
fell
thickly
those
who
were
left
turned
and
ran
at
top
speed
for
the
foot
of
the
slope
they
passed
the
oak
where
they
had
been
rallied
for
the
second
charge
pushed
pell
mell
through
briar
thickets
and
undergrowth
to
fall
sobbing
with
exhaustion
on
the
ground
the
captain
was
there
leaning
against
a
tree
drawing
rasping
breaths
as
the
men
rolled
apprehensive
eyes
toward
him
he
jerked
himself
to
his
feet
went
forward
to
salute
the
colonel
who
just
then
galloped
up
those
men
who
were
lying
near
heard
the
colloquy
between
the
two
heard
the
young
captain
sob
out
disgustedly
the
colonel
s
order
general
hill
says
to
hold
this
position
and
await
fresh
troops
general
deshler
s
heart
were
torn
from
his
body
by
a
shell
that
came
ripping
out
of
the
woods
at
noon
george
rowan
was
with
him
when
it
happened
the
tenth
texas
arrived
on
the
ground
they
were
to
occupy
at
ten
o
clock
it
was
a
wooded
ridge
two
hundred
yards
from
the
yankee
breastworks
colonel
mills
had
dismounted
and
was
running
alongside
of
his
men
when
they
came
up
to
the
crest
semple
s
battery
at
the
left
of
the
ridge
was
still
firing
then
mills
swore
savagely
when
he
saw
the
gunners
limber
up
and
lash
their
horses
to
ride
away
they
want
us
to
hold
it
without
artillery
boys
well
we
god
damn
will
a
shell
bursting
ten
feet
below
threw
up
a
black
geyser
that
covered
him
from
his
men
s
sight
he
emerged
wiping
his
face
free
of
cinders
and
ordered
the
men
to
fall
back
a
little
and
fire
lying
down
then
he
went
down
the
hill
still
swearing
to
see
if
he
could
get
douglas
battery
up
the
was
just
within
range
of
canister
but
the
grape
was
the
worst
under
it
men
dodged
backward
and
forward
like
jack
in
the
boxes
or
plastered
themselves
to
the
hill
so
tight
that
only
the
upward
reaching
of
the
arm
told
the
living
from
the
dead
toward
noon
the
texans
supply
of
ammunition
ran
low
george
was
lying
behind
a
stump
trying
to
pick
off
a
yankee
gunner
when
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
mills
told
him
to
go
find
general
deshler
and
tell
him
the
ammunition
was
giving
out
george
plunged
down
the
hillside
through
a
cloud
of
hot
smoke
just
in
time
to
see
his
little
mare
break
her
tether
and
go
snorting
off
he
cut
a
horse
loose
from
a
captured
gun
mounted
and
using
part
of
a
rope
trace
as
his
riding
whip
rode
off
in
search
of
deshler
the
young
brigadier
was
sitting
his
horse
beside
a
clump
of
sumac
bushes
two
of
his
staff
officers
were
with
him
hearne
was
telling
the
general
that
the
place
was
too
exposed
when
the
ridge
as
rowan
was
giving
the
message
it
was
perhaps
the
sight
of
a
man
who
suddenly
fell
sidewise
from
behind
a
stump
spread
eagling
as
he
fell
that
decided
him
not
to
ask
a
staff
officer
to
risk
his
life
up
there
he
had
half
turned
to
hearne
when
he
shook
his
head
and
murmuring
something
george
thought
it
was
ca
nt
send
that
boy
rode
off
at
a
gallop
he
went
so
fast
that
george
on
his
winded
horse
had
trouble
in
keeping
up
with
him
it
was
hotter
now
than
it
had
been
a
few
minutes
ago
and
mills
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
place
where
he
had
left
him
or
was
it
that
the
place
itself
had
changed
with
the
black
geysers
springing
up
everywhere
keeping
the
very
ground
under
your
feet
in
motion
the
fire
and
brimstone
aunt
charlotte
s
preacher
talked
so
much
about
he
thought
and
he
dodged
his
horse
desperately
through
the
smoke
trying
not
to
lose
sight
of
deshler
deshler
s
big
back
was
oak
a
few
feet
away
george
s
horse
danced
and
george
swayed
involuntarily
far
to
the
right
when
he
came
up
deshler
was
out
of
the
saddle
and
flat
on
the
ground
george
looked
down
saw
the
red
sponge
that
had
been
deshler
s
chest
he
got
off
his
horse
put
his
hands
to
his
face
and
cried
out
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
men
came
running
with
stretchers
mills
was
standing
there
as
they
carried
deshler
s
body
off
he
would
not
look
his
face
was
black
as
a
fiend
s
with
powder
and
he
kept
shouting
to
men
who
were
so
far
up
the
hill
that
they
could
not
hear
him
ammunition
out
get
up
and
bay
net
em
then
rowan
tethered
his
horse
to
a
sapling
and
followed
mills
back
into
the
fight
the
men
were
down
to
their
last
round
now
george
ran
about
over
the
field
gathering
up
cartridge
boxes
from
the
dead
and
wounded
he
had
just
taken
a
pistol
from
a
dead
yankee
when
and
saw
ned
allard
in
a
hand
to
hand
struggle
with
a
yankee
george
ran
a
few
steps
forward
then
stopped
he
passed
a
hand
before
his
forehead
to
clear
his
sight
ned
s
arm
was
locked
around
the
yankee
s
body
but
above
that
arm
george
could
see
blue
cloth
he
levelled
the
pistol
barrel
took
careful
aim
the
hammer
clicked
george
threw
the
the
hold
the
hallorans
had
on
mrs
garr
was
other
than
blood
perhaps
that
was
why
they
came
to
her
for
money
but
the
lectures
had
been
very
auntly
she
had
nt
sounded
as
if
she
were
being
blackmailed
the
others
mr
grant
mr
grant
was
the
wallers
mrs
tewman
they
were
all
in
their
forties
or
early
fifties
they
were
all
the
right
age
it
took
me
back
to
the
beginning
again
they
could
all
be
suspected
and
again
mr
kistler
seemed
the
least
likely
judging
by
the
results
i
d
had
when
i
d
thought
that
before
i
was
probably
due
to
find
out
he
had
been
born
in
mrs
garr
s
house
or
that
mrs
garr
had
ruined
his
father
the
problem
of
who
had
killed
mrs
garr
had
seemed
fairly
simple
before
a
prowler
caught
in
his
prowling
had
been
such
an
obvious
explanation
but
how
complicated
this
business
of
mrs
garr
s
past
made
it
now
the
possibilities
were
almost
endless
i
d
read
enough
detective
stories
to
know
it
was
always
the
least
likely
person
who
went
in
for
murder
that
made
mr
kistler
it
well
i
did
nt
care
if
he
was
it
a
man
who
amused
himself
as
mr
kistler
did
a
chaser
a
sleeper
around
and
i
d
amusing
that
time
he
i
quit
smiling
to
bite
into
my
thoughts
again
if
mr
kistler
s
story
about
friday
night
was
true
then
he
had
an
alibi
for
the
time
when
mrs
garr
probably
came
back
to
the
house
but
he
was
an
extremely
worthless
character
if
his
story
was
nt
true
then
he
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
mrs
garr
s
death
hiding
that
ticket
could
nt
mean
much
else
it
would
also
mean
that
for
certain
mrs
garr
had
been
murdered
i
could
nt
think
of
any
way
her
railroad
ticket
could
have
come
into
mr
kistler
s
possession
if
she
had
died
a
natural
death
if
he
had
murdered
her
then
his
story
about
the
girl
was
nt
true
just
a
faked
up
alibi
made
awful
to
sound
more
convincing
and
then
i
would
nt
have
so
much
reason
to
think
his
character
worthless
he
might
have
had
a
lovely
motive
such
as
revenging
a
sister
i
caught
myself
hoping
he
had
murdered
mrs
garr
decided
i
d
give
it
up
forever
i
gave
up
puzzling
over
mrs
garr
for
the
time
being
anyway
i
went
to
bed
i
was
glad
there
was
a
policeman
in
the
house
just
before
i
dropped
asleep
i
opened
one
eye
i
d
suddenly
thought
who
the
other
officer
must
be
and
why
he
d
ducked
he
did
nt
want
me
to
see
him
i
was
being
shadowed
the
telephone
s
ringing
and
mrs
tewman
in
the
hall
yelling
mr
kistler
mr
kistler
he
do
nt
answer
she
shouted
into
the
phone
she
added
crossly
after
an
interval
all
right
i
ll
knock
probably
i
thought
sleepily
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
knew
where
mr
kistler
was
unless
the
lean
faced
policeman
was
still
on
duty
no
mr
kistler
would
not
answer
the
knock
on
his
door
what
did
it
matter
who
called
him
yes
it
might
i
realized
it
was
up
to
me
to
be
noble
i
wrapped
my
negligee
around
me
in
the
yellow
sunshine
and
went
out
into
the
hall
sure
enough
the
policeman
who
knew
mr
kistler
s
whereabouts
was
gone
we
had
a
new
guard
this
one
sat
on
the
davenport
because
he
probably
could
nt
get
into
the
chair
he
was
a
fat
lump
he
did
nt
say
a
word
he
was
just
there
staring
with
his
round
blue
eyes
we
were
having
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
look
over
the
gilling
city
police
force
mrs
tewman
upstairs
was
pounding
on
a
door
i
picked
up
the
dangling
receiver
hello
this
is
mrs
dacres
i
oh

a
young
man

voice
replied
cordially

the
nerve

holding

a

memorial
day
excursion

chicago
that
s
the
ticket
mrs
garr
was
going
to
use
to
go
to
chicago
on
but
could
nt
find
it
was
a
little
hard
for
mr
kistler
to
explain
oh
for
tripes
sake
where
does
he
say
he
got
it
mr
kistler
s
darling
little
story
is
that
a
girl
gave
it
to
him
one
of
the
girls
you
and
he
were
out
with
a
week
say
maybe
she
did
say
the
girl

was
with

one
too
they

passing
em
around
the
table
they
said
say

when
he
comes
down
wednesday
and
thursday
mornings
say
sometimes
he
does
nt
have
to
come
down
he
is
here
i
did
nt
realize
mr
kistler
went
in
so
heavily
for
labor
he
d
always
spoken
of
his
work
as
a
joke
but
he
would
at
least
at
last
cousin
john
raised
his
hand
for
silence
it
is
the
devout
and
burning
wish
of
every
patriot
that
this
cruel
emergency
may
pass
he
paused
and
surveyed
the
crowd
amid
whose
silence
a
hoof
on
the
cobblestones
could
have
been
heard
a
block
away
his
mouth
widened
almost
into
a
smile
and
he
nodded
his
head
slowly
and
repeatedly
at
last
under
the
spell
of
the
expert
demagogue
there
was
laughter
in
the
pranks
which
was
taken
up
by
the
crowd
who
suddenly
broke
into
cheers
again
cousin
john
gestured
half
bowing
for
silence
now
my
friends
i
come
to
the
greatest
pleasure
of
all
i
have
the
signal
honor
to
present
to
you
your
neighbor
kinsman
and
friend
he
will
be
known
henceforth
until
the
honor
of
further
promotion
as
colonel
montgomery
corse
commander
of
the
seventeenth
virginia
there
was
more
cheering
as
cousin
john
stepped
back
and
colonel
corse
moved
forward
with
a
long
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
he
stood
calm
and
firmly
on
his
head
he
raised
the
paper
and
began
to
read
i
turned
my
back
on
the
platform
the
better
to
manage
the
horses
looking
between
them
i
saw
in
the
crowd
back
against
the
wall
of
the
corner
house
the
impassive
face
of
brother
george
surveying
the
scene
that
our
first
allegiance
is
due
to
virginia
that
we
will
obey
her
commands
and
abide
by
her
fortunes
that
in
her
defense
against
all
assailants
whatsoever
we
are
ready
to
risk
life
and
all
that
renders
life
desirable
to
this
we
pledge
the
faith
of
soldiers
and
the
sacred
affection
of
sons
the
silence
in
which
the
crowd
had
received
the
colonel
s
speech
continued
when
it
broke
i
was
brought
sharply
out
of
the
superior
reality
that
george
s
face
had
created
for
me
i
had
heard
again
his
anguish
in
the
shadowy
back
parlor
they
think
of
nothing
but
marriage
and
death
and
the
honor
of
virginia
you
will
understand
of
course
that
the
honor
of
virginia
meant
something
to
me
yet
words
that
would
ordinarily
have
moved
me
as
it
had
moved
the
crowd
to
shouts
and
tears
had
been
far
away
and
i
knew
what
it
was
to
be
apart
from
the
emotions
that
all
men
shared
i
suppose
i
came
nearer
there
in
the
street
holding
his
mare
to
seeing
the
world
through
george
posey
s
eyes
than
i
had
ever
come
before
before
the
cheering
began
i
fancied
i
had
caught
his
eye
and
a
gleam
of
this
communion
flashed
to
me
before
i
knew
it
the
officers
were
taking
their
horses
from
me
cousin
john
flushed
with
his
exertion
said
lead
her
down
to
the
marshall
house
george
ll
get
her
there
when
i
turned
round
to
start
the
fierce
yells
struck
me
the
crowd
and
the
soldiers
had
melted
as
i
slowly
made
way
for
the
big
mare
in
the
direction
of
king
street
when
i
came
to
the
marshall
house
the
crowd
was
thinning
away
i
tied
queen
susie
at
the
hitching
rack
around
on
the
where
i
expected
to
find
brother
george
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
hesitated
before
i
could
decide
to
enter
i
had
been
forbidden
to
go
into
taverns
but
i
remembered
it
was
sunday
the
bar
would
be
closed
and
i
had
a
definite
mission
gadsby
s
i
think
was
considered
a
more
genteel
place
but
one
of
the
early
gadsbys
had
been
a
speculator
that
is
a
negro
trader
and
papa
was
dead
set
against
the
very
name
mr
jackson
the
proprietor
of
the
marshall
house
was
an
excellent
man
i
walked
through
the
front
door
into
the
dim
little
office
there
were
some
strange
men
leaning
upon
the
desk
behind
which
on
the
wall
was
a
rack
upon
which
a
few
keys
hung
from
wooden
pegs
against
the
opposite
wall
stood
a
row
of
big
unpainted
chairs
flanked
at
each
end
by
large
hr
ass
cuspidors
most
of
the
chairs
were
occupied
by
men
silently
smoking
cigars
i
walked
up
to
the
desk
said
mr
jackson
gave
me
a
polite
glance
followed
by
recognition
lacy
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
waited
for
the
rest
of
what
he
would
surely
say
but
got
instead
only
an
urbane
stare
i
am
looking
for
mr
posey
sir
i
expect
he
ll
be
in
here
in
a
minute
he
turned
away
but
he
too
had
felt
his
omission
and
he
looked
at
me
again
he
had
a
strong
shrewd
face
partly
concealed
by
a
wide
black
mustache
son
he
said
i
hope
that
your
father
is
well
he
paused
i
have
nt
seen
him
all
this
past
week
i
feel
that
people
are
entitled
to
differences
of
opinion
he
said
it
coldly
and
turned
again
to
the
men
by
god
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
if
yankee
soldiers
enter
this
town
they
ll
be
greeted
by
two
four
pounders
from
my
back
yard
i
ve
got
em
in
one
of
the
chairs
quickly
folded
his
newspaper
and
walked
out
of
the
hotel
all
eyes
followed
him
too
hot
for
him
one
of
the
strange
men
said
i
heard
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
in
the
back
of
the
room
it
was
george
he
smiled
at
me
without
speaking
walked
to
the
desk
and
laid
a
key
upon
it
five
dollars
sir
said
mr
jackson
george
took
five
silver
dollars
out
of
his
trousers
pocket
and
stacked
them
neatly
upon
the
desk
he
had
evidently
been
in
alexandria
for
nearly
a
week
but
he
had
not
come
near
us
what
had
he
been
doing
he
came
to
me
at
the
end
of
the
desk
semmes
wants
you
to
go
over
and
visit
us
in
georgetown
lacy
he
said
i
said
nothing
your
pa
sent
him
a
message
i
was
bewildered
school
ai
nt
over
yet
brother
george
i
said
the
front
door
opened
john
entered
there
was
no
greeting
except
that
george
nodded
to
this
it
would
worry
her
dreadfully
if
i
m
late
she
ll
wonder
she
might
ask
where
i
ve
been
i
ll
call
you
in
the
morning
from
the
office
i
mean
wiping
her
eyes
cicily
had
smiled
at
this
novice
in
deception
who
was
her
grey
haired
father
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
wanted
him
to
go
albert
at
that
moment
might
be
walking
up
from
the
station
if
he
found
them
together
like
mumsy
he
d
wonder
and
her
father
s
discretion
might
be
strained
to
the
breaking
point
their
future
relations
if
they
were
to
seem
amicable
depended
on
the
assumption
that
the
latter
was
left
alone
she
remembered
that
bertie
had
seen
his
grandfather
she
must
tell
him
not
to
mention
it
she
found
him
eating
his
cereal
and
his
apple
sauce
in
the
pantry
for
he
still
had
supper
early
spread
on
a
tray
under
cover
of
the
whirr
of
vesta
s
eggbeater
in
the
kitchen
she
whispered
conspiratorially
it
s
a
secret
from
daddy
a
surprise
you
must
nt
tell
him
the
innocent
faith
of
her
little
accomplice
pricked
cicily
s
conscience
like
christmas
he
suggested
his
dark
eyes
dancing
it
seemed
shameful
and
sordid
to
make
use
of
a
child
she
walked
back
into
the
living
room
thinking
how
little
her
own
deceit
troubled
her
and
remembering
the
days
when
a
thought
concealed
from
albert
had
seemed
a
major
disloyalty
presently
she
heard
his
latchkey
in
the
door
cicily
he
called
as
soon
as
he
d
opened
it
i
m
here
in
the
living
room
she
wondered
if
he
d
notice
the
traces
of
her
entered
the
room
not
yet
she
said
falsely
then
as
his
face
fell
has
anything
happened
oh
no
not
at
all
fox
is
drawing
up
the
papers
he
moved
a
little
nearer
why
sweet
have
you
been
crying
denial
would
be
absurd
so
she
took
refuge
in
severity
i
have
plenty
to
cry
about
he
gazed
at
her
helplessly
across
the
gulf
of
their
estrangement
why
do
you
torment
yourself
how
she
asked
harshly
he
shrugged
and
turned
away
from
her
unwilling
apparently
to
be
led
into
a
quarrel
he
sat
down
in
the
armchair
and
opened
the
evening
paper
its
pages
crackled
in
the
silence
before
he
answered
her
question
very
unnecessarily
by
tormenting
me
before
noon
the
next
day
her
father
called
her
on
the
telephone
i
ve
talked
with
fox
he
said
briefly
and
wired
to
alden
he
ll
send
you
the
money
in
fact
said
cicily
with
equal
brevity
she
hoped
that
her
father
would
tell
her
no
more
his
words
had
implied
that
fox
had
been
convincing
but
she
did
nt
want
to
know
if
he
d
mentioned
harold
doty
you
re
sure
you
do
nt
want
me
to
have
a
word
with
albert
he
asked
very
briskly
avoiding
emotion
i
d
like
to
he
added
oh
no
dad
please
very
well
he
accepted
it
how
are
you
feeling
much
better
really
did
mumsy
suspect
anything
i
think
that
she
knew
i
had
something
on
my
mind
about
me
i
do
nt
think
so
we
ll
keep
her
in
darkness
stygian
said
cicily
thanks
a
lot
dad
good
bye
the
very
next
morning
before
breakfast
was
over
the
check
arrived
from
uncle
alden
air
mail
special
delivery
accompanied
by
a
letter
expressing
shocked
disapproval
cicily
endorsed
it
before
albert
left
of
green
paper
with
her
name
and
her
husband
s
written
on
the
back
of
it
in
her
small
square
handwriting
could
avert
disaster
she
had
to
force
herself
to
realize
that
it
signified
a
transference
of
property
of
very
considerable
value
as
she
handed
it
to
albert
she
had
no
sense
of
loss
but
he
in
accepting
it
seemed
to
realize
everything
the
humblest
gratitude
shone
in
his
eyes
do
nt
make
a
speech
said
cicily
hastily
and
then
they
both
laughed
i
t
was
very
assuaging
to
laugh
again
with
albert
cicily
immediately
felt
more
at
ease
that
laughter
marked
a
moment
when
fit
seemed
quite
possible
that
they
might
achieve
a
relationship
that
was
friendly
and
affectionate
and
nothing
more
disturbing
and
even
maintain
it
albert
did
nothing
to
shatter
this
illusion
he
seemed
ready
at
last
to
accept
her
as
a
friend
a
friend
and
a
partner
to
be
kept
scrupulously
informed
of
the
events
that
followed
that
very
evening
he
and
reported
his
departure
for
his
native
waukesha
he
had
brought
home
a
check
for
three
thousand
dollars
and
ventured
a
smile
as
he
said
here
s
your
change
what
about
fox
s
bill
cicily
asked
anxiously
i
ll
settle
that
myself
he
was
eager
to
assure
her
it
s
not
very
large
finally
one
evening
when
the
children
were
busy
with
their
home
work
in
the
dining
room
and
cicily
sat
by
the
living
room
fire
ivy
left
for
new
york
today
he
informed
her
casually
she
could
not
help
asking
did
you
see
her
off
no
i
had
lunch
with
her
he
volunteered
calmly
again
she
faced
the
fact
that
albert
had
once
emphasized
the
truth
could
be
unpleasant
she
asked
was
that
necessary
her
voice
a
trifle
sharp
he
answered
it
was
kind
she
could
not
deny
that
a
man
owed
his
former
mistress
the
courtesy
of
kindness
but
she
resented
this
glimpse
of
ivy
at
a
little
restaurant
table
and
imagined
their
talk
coloured
by
the
intimacies
that
had
existed
between
them
she
felt
an
aversion
profound
and
instinctive
to
all
irregular
relationships
a
horror
of
the
persistence
of
the
memories
that
must
follow
them
i
m
glad
you
were
kind
she
said
somewhat
stiffly
and
very
untruthfully
then
suddenly
anguish
welled
up
within
her
and
after
a
moment
of
painful
irresolution
she
asked
albert
does
she
still
love
you
with
pitiful
intensity
the
question
surprised
and
a
little
embarrassed
him
well
he
said
awkwardly
not
as
she
did
the
implication
that
she
had
and
with
passion
shook
cicily
almost
as
if
realised
that
frith
will
have
taken
them
to
the
morning
room
she
said
it
must
be
getting
on
for
half
past
twelve
you
know
your
way
now
do
nt
you
yes
mrs
danvers
i
said
and
i
went
down
the
big
stairway
into
the
hall
knowing
she
was
standing
there
above
me
her
eyes
watching
me
i
knew
i
must
go
back
now
to
the
morning
room
and
meet
maxim
s
sister
and
her
husband
i
could
not
hide
in
my
bedroom
now
over
my
daphne
du
maurier
shoulder
and
i
saw
mrs
danvers
still
standing
there
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
like
a
black
sentinel
i
stood
for
a
moment
outside
the
morning
room
with
my
hand
on
the
door
listening
to
the
hum
of
voices
maxim
had
returned
then
while
i
had
been
upstairs
bringing
his
agent
with
him
i
supposed
for
it
sounded
to
me
as
if
the
room
was
full
of
people
i
was
aware
of
the
same
feeling
of
sick
uncertainty
i
had
experienced
so
often
as
a
child
when
summoned
to
shake
hands
with
visitors
and
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
i
blundered
in
to
be
met
at
once
it
seemed
with
a
sea
of
faces
and
a
general
silence
here
she
is
at
last
said
maxim
where
have
you
been
hiding
we
were
thinking
of
sending
out
a
search
party
here
is
beatrice
and
this
is
giles
and
this
is
frank
crawley
look
out
you
nearly
trod
on
the
dog
handsome
very
much
like
maxim
about
the
eyes
and
jaw
but
not
as
smart
as
i
had
expected
much
tweedier
the
sort
of
person
who
would
nurse
dogs
through
distemper
know
about
horses
shoot
well
she
did
not
kiss
me
she
shook
hands
very
firmly
looking
me
straight
in
the
eyes
and
then
she
turned
to
maxim
quite
different
from
what
i
expected
does
nt
answer
to
your
description
at
all
everyone
laughed
and
i
joined
in
not
quite
certain
if
the
laugh
was
against
me
or
not
wondering
secretly
what
it
was
she
had
expected
and
what
had
been
maxim
s
description
and
this
is
giles
said
maxim
prodding
my
arm
and
giles
stretched
out
an
enormous
paw
and
wrung
my
hand
squeezing
the
fingers
limp
genial
eyes
smiling
from
behind
horn
rimmed
glasses
frank
crawley
said
maxim
and
i
turned
to
the
agent
a
colourless
rather
thin
man
with
a
prominent
adam
s
apple
in
i
wondered
why
but
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
that
because
frith
had
come
in
and
was
offering
me
sherry
and
beatrice
was
talking
to
me
again
maxim
tells
me
you
only
got
back
last
night
i
had
not
realised
that
or
of
course
we
would
never
have
thrust
ourselves
upon
you
so
soon
well
what
do
you
think
of
manderley
i
ve
scarcely
seen
anything
of
it
yet
i
answered
it
s
beautiful
of
course
she
was
looking
me
up
and
down
as
i
had
expected
but
in
a
direct
straightforward
fashion
not
maliciously
like
mrs
danvers
not
with
unfriendliness
she
had
a
right
to
judge
me
she
was
rebecca
maxim
s
sister
and
maxim
himself
came
to
my
side
now
putting
his
arm
through
mine
giving
me
confidence
you
re
looking
better
old
man
she
said
to
him
her
head
on
one
side
considering
him
you
ve
lost
ve
got
you
to
thank
for
that
nodding
at
me
i
m
always
very
fit
said
maxim
shortly
never
had
anything
wrong
with
me
in
my
life
you
imagine
everyone
ill
who
does
nt
look
as
fat
as
giles
bosh
said
beatrice
you
know
perfectly
well
you
were
a
perfect
wreck
six
months
ago
gave
me
the
fright
of
my
life
when
i
came
and
saw
you
i
thought
you
were
in
for
a
breakdown
giles
bear
me
out
did
nt
maxim
look
perfectly
ghastly
last
time
we
came
over
and
did
nt
i
say
he
was
heading
for
a
breakdown
well
i
must
say
old
chap
you
re
looking
a
different
person
said
giles
very
good
thing
you
went
away
does
nt
he
look
well
crawley
i
could
tell
by
the
tightening
of
maxim
s
muscles
under
my
arm
that
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
temper
for
some
reason
this
talk
about
even
and
i
thought
it
tactless
of
beatrice
to
harp
upon
it
in
this
way
making
so
big
a
point
of
it
maxim
s
very
sunburnt
i
said
shyly
it
hides
a
multitude
of
sins
you
should
have
seen
him
in
venice
having
breakfast
on
the
balcony
trying
to
get
brown
on
purpose
he
thinks
it
makes
him
better
looking
everyone
laughed
and
mr
crawley
said
it
must
have
been
wonderful
in
venice
mrs
de
winter
this
time
of
the
year
and
yes
i
said
we
had
really
wonderful
weather
only
one
bad
day
was
nt
it
maxim
the
conversation
drawing
away
happily
from
his
health
and
so
to
italy
safest
of
subjects
and
the
blessed
topic
of
fine
weather
conversation
was
easy
now
no
longer
an
effort
maxim
and
giles
and
beatrice
were
discussing
the
running
of
maxim
s
car
and
mr
crawley
was
asking
if
it
was
true
there
were
no
more
do
nt
think
he
would
have
cared
at
all
had
there
been
steamers
at
anchor
in
the
grand
canal
he
was
saying
this
to
help
me
it
was
his
contribution
to
the
little
effort
of
steering
the
talk
away
from
maxim
s
health
and
i
was
grateful
to
him
feeling
him
an
ally
for
all
his
dull
appearance
jasper
wants
exercise
said
beatrice
stirring
the
dog
with
her
daphne
du
maurier
foot
he
s
getting
much
too
fat
and
he
s
barely
two
years
old
what
do
you
feed
him
on
maxim
my
dear
beatrice
he
has
exactly
the
same
routine
as
your
dogs
said
maxim
do
nt
show
off
and
make
out
you
know
more
about
animals
than
i
do
dear
old
boy
how
can
you
pretend
to
know
what
jasper
has
been
and
tell
of
time
knowing
that
he
still
loved
her
as
he
had
loved
nothing
on
earth
but
mary
a
perfect
child
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
he
spoke
because
he
could
no
longer
help
it
miss
lettie
he
heard
himself
saying
as
he
rose
and
stood
beside
her
i
would
be
proud
and
honored
to
have
you
marry
me
it
was
out
at
last
over
her
head
william
s
face
loomed
startled
into
immobility
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
philip
he
demanded
sharply
i
m
asking
her
to
marry
me
william
philip
responded
quietly
just
what
you
heard
me
say
letitia
took
no
notice
of
their
conversation
if
she
heard
it
it
seemed
to
make
no
impression
on
her
jumping
jehosophat
exploded
william
glaring
at
his
cousin
and
falling
back
on
an
expletive
that
he
was
apt
to
use
under
stress
you
ve
had
two
wives
already
he
blurted
out
the
truth
stung
to
a
biting
fury
that
knew
no
pity
very
true
answered
philip
refusing
to
lose
his
temper
too
true
but
need
that
matter
to
her
he
inquired
reasonably
she
is
not
in
love
with
rte
ant
in
love
with
her
he
explained
it
s
the
truth
william
he
added
meeting
his
cousin
s
incredulous
gaze
letitia
stirred
against
william
s
shoulder
and
raising
her
face
she
looked
straight
at
philip
he
said
that
he
thought
he
had
loved
her
once
he
would
nt
deny
it
he
said
that
would
be
like
denying
he
loved
me
now
she
was
silent
but
they
could
see
she
was
repeating
his
words
to
herself
that
she
had
not
finished
what
she
had
to
say
suddenly
she
moved
over
to
philip
and
standing
straight
and
still
in
front
of
him
with
her
hands
clasped
tightly
together
and
tell
of
time
replied
to
the
proposal
that
he
you
tomorrow
she
told
philip
in
a
clear
dead
voice
and
turning
went
rapidly
into
the
house
william
sat
down
abruptly
and
studied
philip
s
face
you
must
be
crazy
he
said
gazing
intently
at
his
cousin
entirely
crazy
but
i
believe
you
are
telling
the
truth
i
never
knew
you
to
do
otherwise
he
admitted
he
was
puzzled
and
irritable
as
people
and
ants
become
when
they
do
not
know
how
to
get
around
obstacles
suddenly
set
up
in
the
path
they
wish
to
follow
philip
stood
with
his
hand
on
one
of
the
posts
supporting
the
steep
overhanging
balcony
he
could
just
catch
the
murmur
of
the
river
flowing
over
the
twisted
cypress
roots
that
deflected
its
current
and
caused
it
ever
so
often
even
to
shift
its
bed
he
felt
old
remote
and
suddenly
extremely
weary
yet
he
was
more
at
peace
than
he
had
been
for
many
a
day
the
die
was
cast
at
any
rate
that
his
desires
would
necessarily
determine
the
outcome
such
a
state
of
mind
would
have
been
impossible
for
povey
a
younger
man
to
summon
of
course
william
went
on
firmly
she
did
nt
mean
it
and
if
she
did
i
would
nt
expect
you
to
take
advantage
of
her
excitement
she
s
upset
now
she
ll
think
differently
in
the
morning
he
stood
up
deeply
perturbed
by
the
turn
his
plans
had
taken
go
on
home
philip
he
said
studying
his
cousin
s
face
we
are
all
tired
and
worked
up
this
ca
nt
he
settled
tonight
you
ll
see
how
foolish
the
whole
thing
is
in
the
morning
go
to
bed
that
s
best
if
you
stay
were
both
apt
to
say
something
we
ll
regret
later
on
without
moving
philip
answered
ii
is
back
was
still
to
william
and
he
spoke
almost
as
if
he
were
dreaming
his
words
and
tell
of
timedropping
from
his
lips
william
i
d
better
go
home
he
assented
they
ll
both
think
better
of
it
overnight
i
expect
povey
ll
be
over
before
daybreak
he
smiled
a
slow
reminiscent
smile
then
he
swung
around
abruptly
facing
his
cousin
with
an
expression
that
william
recognized
in
their
boyhood
when
he
had
noticed
philip
s
eyes
narrow
and
harden
as
t
hey
now
did
he
had
learned
there
was
never
any
use
arguing
further
listen
and
mark
what
i
say
though
william
if
she
is
willing
to
stand
by
what
she
said
nothing
on
god
s
earth
can
prevent
me
from
marrying
her
suddenly
he
put
out
his
hand
and
shook
william
s
spur
frame
vigorously
it
s
absurd
of
course
it
s
absurd
i
know
it
we
re
both
a
couple
of
doddering
old
idiots
they
ll
be
certain
to
make
it
up
tomorrow
good
night
i
ll
take
your
advice
and
go
to
bed
william
sighed
in
relief
almost
he
said
urgently
go
while
you
re
talking
sense
philip
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
homeward
when
had
he
felt
such
lethargy
and
utter
fatigue
as
now
overtook
him
such
dead
and
desperate
certainty
that
there
was
no
longer
any
use
either
to
hope
or
to
grieve
as
he
was
drifting
off
to
sleep
he
remembered
twice
in
his
life
when
he
had
felt
like
this
the
day
mary
died
and
the
clay
he
heard
general
lee
had
surrendered
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
until
the
sun
was
well
up
in
the
sky
his
servant
matt
was
standing
by
his
bed
touching
him
lightly
dar
s
a
young
lady
outside
suh
he
was
saying
apologetically
she
tell
me
she
hatter
see
you
right
straight
away
and
cai
nt
wait
philip
was
instantly
awake
he
reached
out
for
the
cup
of
and
tell
of
time
black
coffee
in
matt
s
other
hand
thinking
at
once
that
some
of
his
patients
had
taken
a
saucer
to
cool
he
hastily
drew
on
his
clothes
it
s
probably
the
miller
child
he
decided
lockjaw
too
i
m
afraid
i
suspected
it
yesterday
he
lifted
his
saddlebags
where
bottles
neatly
labelled
in
latin
rested
in
small
leather
pockets
then
picking
up
his
surgical
case
he
checked
over
its
contents
back
towards
the
library
windows
the
alarm
seemed
to
have
gone
up
inside
the
house
and
this
time
what
did
i
see
i
saw
this
distinguished
venerable
gentleman
again
his
curt
nod
indicated
murray
carefully
juggling
two
thumbographs
guiltily
putting
one
in
his
pocket
and
hastily
putting
the
other
on
the
table
murray
had
been
listening
with
critical
interest
so
so
he
observed
with
an
almost
teutonic
inflection
you
thought
i
was
working
against
you
as
usual
you
understate
the
case
returned
gore
his
face
darkened
so
i
did
not
care
to
tell
where
i
had
been
i
reserved
the
knowledge
of
what
i
had
seen
for
a
shot
in
the
locker
in
case
dirty
work
had
been
attempted
have
you
anything
more
to
add
to
that
no
inspector
i
think
not
the
rest
of
what
i
said
was
true
but
may
i
ask
who
saw
me
knowles
was
standing
at
the
window
of
the
green
room
said
elliot
and
the
other
began
to
whistle
through
his
teeth
then
elliot
s
gaze
moved
from
gore
to
murray
to
welkyn
has
any
of
you
ever
seen
this
before
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
smaller
section
of
newspaper
in
which
the
stained
clasp
knife
had
been
carefully
wrapped
he
opened
it
and
exhibited
the
knife
the
expressions
of
gore
and
welkyn
showed
a
general
blankness
but
murray
sucked
in
his
bearded
cheeks
he
where
did
you
find
this
murray
asked
briskly
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
do
you
recognize
it
h
m
you
have
tested
it
for
fingerprints
no
ah
a
pity
said
murray
growing
brisker
and
brisker
will
you
allow
me
to
touch
it
if
i
handle
it
with
the
greatest
circumspection
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
did
nt
you
young
johnny
he
glanced
at
gore
use
to
have
a
knife
exactly
like
this
did
nt
i
present
it
to
you
in
fact
did
nt
you
carry
it
for
years
i
certainly
did
i
always
carry
a
pocket
knife
admitted
gore
reaching
into
his
pocket
and
producing
an
old
knife
only
slightly
smaller
and
lighter
than
the
one
before
them
but
for
once
interposed
welkyn
slapping
his
hand
on
the
table
for
once
and
all
i
must
insist
on
exercising
the
rights
with
which
you
sir
absurd
and
improper
and
as
your
legal
adviser
i
must
tell
you
to
disregard
them
such
knives
are
as
common
as
blackberries
i
once
had
one
myself
but
what
is
wrong
with
the
question
asked
gore
puzzled
i
owned
a
knife
like
that
it
went
with
the
rest
of
my
clothes
and
effects
in
the
titanic
but
it
seems
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
one
there
could
be
before
anybody
could
stop
him
murray
had
whipped
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
moistened
it
at
his
lips
a
handkerchief
in
the
mouth
is
one
of
the
things
which
always
set
page
s
teeth
on
edge
and
wiped
clean
a
small
section
of
the
blade
about
halfway
down
into
the
cleared
steel
had
been
roughly
cut
letters
forming
the
word
madeline
it
is
yours
johnny
said
murray
comfortably
you
put
this
name
there
one
day
when
i
took
you
through
the
stonecutting
works
at
ilford
madeline
repeated
gore
opening
out
his
cigar
into
the
sodden
trees
but
page
saw
his
face
reflected
momentarily
in
the
gloomy
glass
it
was
a
curious
set
indecipherable
face
unlike
the
one
of
mockery
with
which
gore
usually
pointed
out
the
difference
between
his
moods
and
the
world
s
he
turned
back
but
what
about
the
knife
are
you
suggesting
that
that
poor
tortured
would
be
honest
crook
kept
it
about
him
all
these
years
and
finally
cut
his
throat
with
it
by
the
pool
you
seem
to
have
determined
that
this
is
a
case
of
murder
and
yet
and
yet
he
beat
the
flat
of
his
hand
slowly
on
his
knee
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
gentlemen
said
elliot
it
s
an
absolutely
impossible
crime
he
detailed
to
them
knowles
s
story
the
interest
exhibited
by
both
gore
and
murray
was
in
contrast
to
the
evident
disgust
and
bewilderment
of
welkyn
when
elliot
described
the
finding
of
the
knife
there
was
an
uneasy
movement
through
the
group
gore
reflectively
he
looked
at
murray
magister
this
is
a
matter
after
your
own
heart
i
do
nt
seem
to
know
you
perhaps
we
have
grown
too
far
apart
but
in
the
old
days
you
would
have
hopped
round
the
inspector
full
of
strange
theories
and
bearded
like
the
pard
i
am
no
longer
a
fool
johnny
still
let
us
hear
a
theory
any
theory
so
far
you
are
the
only
one
who
has
been
reticent
about
the
whole
affair
i
second
that
motion
observed
dr
fell
murray
settled
himself
more
comfortably
and
began
to
wag
his
finger
the
exercise
of
pure
logic
he
began
is
often
comparable
to
working
out
immense
sums
in
arithmetic
and
finding
at
the
end
that
we
have
somewhere
forgotten
to
carry
one
or
multiply
by
two
every
one
of
a
thousand
figures
and
factors
may
be
correct
except
that
one
but
the
difference
in
the
answer
to
the
sum
may
be
pure
logic
i
make
a
suggestion
you
know
inspector
that
the
coroner
s
inquest
is
almost
certainly
going
to
call
this
suicide
ca
nt
say
that
sir
not
necessarily
declared
elliot
a
thumbograph
was
stolen
and
then
returned
a
girl
was
nearly
frightened
to
death
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
said
murray
opening
his
eyes
what
verdict
a
coroner
s
jury
will
return
it
is
remotely
possible
that
the
victim
might
have
killed
himself
and
flung
the
knife
away
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
have
been
murdered
but
i
assume
that
it
is
murder
heh
said
dr
fell
rubbing
his
hands
heh
heh
heh
and
the
suggestion
assuming
that
it
is
murder
said
murray
i
suggest
that
the
victim
was
not
in
fact
killed
with
the
knife
you
have
there
i
suggest
that
the
marks
on
his
s
well
make
up
your
mind
to
that
we
better
go
al
said
tom
asked
when

tom
watched
while
they
set
the
heavy
head
gently
down
over
the
head
bolts
and
dropped
it
evenly
have
to
talk
about

an

the
nuts
and
screwed
them
down
as
far
as
he
could
with
his
fingers
me
an
my
wife
come

he
said

but
hell

an

on
an
now
god

where
they
are
been
lookin
an
askin
about

ever
since
he
fitted
his
wrench
to
the
engine
headbolts
and
turned
them
down
evenly
one
turn
to
each
nut
around
and
around
the
series
tom
squatted
down
beside
the
car
and
squinted
his
eyes
up
the
line
of
tents
a
little
stubble
was
beaten
into
the
earth
between
the
tents
no
sir
he
said
ma
ai
nt
gon
na
like
you
goin
off
well
seems
to
me
a
lone
fella
got
more
chance
of
work
it
at
all
two
cars
loaded
with
disconsolate
men
drove
down
into
the
camp
floyd
lifted
his
eyes
but
he
did
nt
ask
them
about
their
luck
their
dusty
faces
were
sad
and
resistant
the
sun
was
sinking
now
and
the
yellow
sunlight
fell
on
the
hooverville
and
on
the
willows
behind
it
the
children
began
to
come
out
of
the
tents
to
wander
about
the
camp
and
from
the
tents
the
women
came
and
built
their
little
fires
the
men
gathered
in
squatting
groups
and
talked
together
a
new
chevrolet
coupe
turned
off
the
highway
and
headed
down
into
the
camp
it
pulled
to
the
center
of
the
camp
tom
said
who
s
this
they
do
nt
belong
here
floyd
said
i
du
n
no
cops
maybe
the
car
door
opened
and
a
man
got
out
and
stood
beside
the
car
his
companion
remained
seated
now
all
the
squatting
men
looked
at
the
newcomers
and
the
conversation
was
still
and
the
women
building
their
fires
closer
with
elaborate
circuitousness
edging
inward
in
long
curves
floyd
put
down
his
wrench
tom
stood
up
al
wiped
his
hands
on
his
trousers
the
three
strolled
toward
the
chevrolet
the
man
who
had
got
out
of
the
car
was
dressed
in
khaki
trousers
and
a
flannel
shirt
he
wore
a
flat
brimmed
stetson
hat
a
sheaf
of
papers
was
held
in
his
shirt
pocket
by
a
little
fence
of
fountain
pens
and
yellow
pencils
and
from
his
hip
pocket
protruded
a
notebook
with
metal
covers
he
moved
to
one
of
the
groups
of
squatting
men
and
they
looked
up
at
him
suspicious
and
quiet
they
watched
him
and
did
not
move
the
whites
of
their
eyes
showed
beneath
the
irises
for
they
did
not
raise
their
heads
to
look
tom
and
ai
and
floyd
strolled
casually
near
the
man
said
you
men
want
to
work
still
they
looked
quietly
suspiciously
and
men
from
all
over
the
camp
moved
near
pone
of
the
squatting
men
spoke
at
last
work
tulare
county
fruit
s
opening
up
need
a
lot
of
pickers
floyd
spoke
up
you
doin
the
hiring
well
i
m
contracting
the
land
the
men
were
in
a
compact
group
now
an
overalled
man
took
off
his
black
hat
and
combed
back
his
long
black
hair
with
his
fingers
what
you
payin
he
asked
well
ca
nt

cents

guess
why
ca
nt
you
tell
you

the
contract

you

true
the
khaki
man
said
but
it
s
keyed
to
the
price

be
a
little
more
might
be
a
little
less
floyd
stepped
out
ahead
he
said
quietly

o
k
i
m
out

for
tulare
county
going
to
need
a
lot
of
men
floyd
turned
to
the
crowd
of
men
they
were
standing
up
now
said
twice
said
the
inspector
severely
how
do
you
suppose
he
felt
when
we
got
your
report
that
his
fourteenth
great
grandson
had
rickets
well
said
doc
mellhorn
i
know
rickets
and
he
had
em
and
you
re
going
to
have
rickets
in
these
youngsters
as
long
as
you
on
the
best
pennsylvania
anthracite
and
look
at
him
now
i
admit
the
success
of
your
treatment
said
the
inspector
but
naturally
well
since
then
we
ve
been
deluged
with
demands
for
anthracite
from
as
far
south
as
sheol
we
ll
have
to
float
a
new
bond
issue
and
what
will
the
taxpayers
say
he
was
just
cutting
his
first
horns
when
he
came
to
us
said
doc
mellhorn
reminiscently
and
they
were
coming
in
crooked
now
i
ask
you
did
you
ever
we
a
straighter
pair
of
course
if
i
d
had
cod
liver
oil
my
gracious
you
ought
to
have
somebody
here
that
c
an
fill
a
prescription
i
ca
nt
do
it
all
the
inspector
shut
his
papers
together
with
a
snap
i
m
sorry
doctor
mellhorn
he
said
but
this
is
final
you
have
no
right
here
in
the
first
place
no
to
al
license
to
practice
a
little
irregular
said
doc
mellhorn
hut
i
m
a
registered
member
of
four
different
medical
associations
you
might
take
that
into
account
and
i
ll
take
any
examination
that
s
required
no
said
the
inspector
violently
no
no
no
you
ca
nt
stay
here
you
ve
got
to
go
away
it
is
nt
possible
doc
mellhorn
drew
a
long
breath
well
he
said
there
was
nt
any
work
for
me
at
the
other
place
and
here
you
wo
nt
let
me
practice
so
what
s
a
man
to
do
the
inspector
was
silent
tell
me
said
doc
mellhorn
presently
suppose
you
do
throw
me
out
what
happens
to
miss
smith
and
paisley
and
the
rest
of
them
oh
what
s
done
is
done
said
the
inspector
impatiently
here
as
well
as
anywhere
else
we
ll
have
to
keep
on
with
the
anthracite
and
the
rest
in
the
future
if
it
s
any
satisfaction
to
you
you
ve
started
something
well
i
guess
smith
and
ferguson
between
them
can
handle
the
practice
said
doc
mellhorn
but
that
s
got
to
be
a
promise
it
s
a
promise
said
the
inspector
then
there
s
mickey
i
mean
asmodeus
said
doc
mellhorn
he
s
a
smart
youngster
smart
as
a
whip
if
he
is
a
hellion
well
you
know
how
a
youngster
gets
well
it
seems
he
wants
to
be
a
doctor
but
i
do
nt
know
what
sort
of
training
he
d
get
he
ll
get
it
said
the
inspector
feverishly
we
ll
found
the
finest
medical
college
you
ever
saw
right
here
in
west
baal
we
ll
build
a
hospital
that
ll
knock
your
eye
out
you
ll
be
satisfied
but
now
if
you
do
nt
mind
all
right
said
doc
but
do
nt
you
want
to
he
said
i
mean
my
instructions
are
we
to
give
you
a
banquet
if
necessary
after
all
the
community
appreciates
thanks
said
doc
mellhorn
with
a
shudder
but
if
i
ve
got
to
go
i
d
rather
get
out
of
town
you
hang
around
and
announce
your
retirement
and
pretty
soon
folks
start
thinking
they
ought
to
give
you
a
testimonial
and
i
never
did
like
testimonials
all
the
same
before
he
left
he
took
a
silver
half
dollar
out
of
mickey
asmodeus
chin
when
he
was
back
on
the
road
again
and
the
lights
of
the
gates
had
faded
into
a
low
ruddy
glow
behind
him
doc
mellhorn
felt
alone
for
the
first
time
he
d
been
lonely
at
times
during
his
life
but
he
d
never
felt
alone
like
this
before
because
as
far
as
he
could
sec
there
was
only
him
and
lizzie
now
now
maybe
if
i
d
talked
to
i
always
was
pigheaded
he
did
nt
pay
much
attention
to
the
way
he
was
driving
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
road
was
nt
quite
the
same
but
he
felt
tired
for
a
wonder
hone
tired
and
beaten
and
he
did
nt
much
care
about
the
road
he
had
nt
felt
tired
since
he
left
earth
but
now
the
loneliness
tired
him
active
always
been
active
he
said
to
himself
i
ca
nt
just
lay
down
on
the
job
but
what
s
a
man
to
do
what
s
a
man
to
do
he
said
i
m
a
doctor
i
ca
nt
work
miracles
then
the
black
fit
came
over
him
and
he
remembered
all
the
times
he
d
been
wrong
and
all
the
people
he
could
nt
do
anything
for
never
was
much
of
a
doctor
i
guess
he
said
maybe
if
i
d
gone
to
vienna
well
the
right
kind
of
man
would
have
gone
how
was
i
to
know
he
d
hemorrhage
but
i
should
have
known
i
ve
diagnosed
walking
typhoid
as
appendicitis
just
the
once
but
that
s
enough
and
i
still
do
nt
know
what
held
me
back
when
i
was
all
ready
to
operate
i
used
to
wake
up
in
a
sweat
six
months
afterward
thinking
i
had
i
could
have
saved
those
premature
twins
if
i
d
known
as
much
then
as
i
do
now
i
guess
that
guy
dafoe
would
have
done
it
anyway
look
at
what
he
had
to
work
with
but
i
did
nt
and
that
finished
the
gorhams
having
children
that
s
a
dandy
doctor
is
nt
it
makes
you
feel
fine
i
could
have
pulled
old
man
halsey
through
and
edna
biggs
and
the
little
lauriat
girl
no
i
could
nt
have
done
it
with
her
that
was
before
insulin
i
could
nt
have
cured
ted
allen
no
i
m
clear
on
that
bates
is
all
right
good
as
they
come
but
i
knew
her
inside
and
out
ought
to
too
she
was
the
biggest
nuisance
that
ever
came
into
the
office
and
if
i
had
nt
mouth
hung
loose
the
cigarette
balanced
on
his
lower
lip
you
think
you
re
smart
and
you
re
so
goddamned
dumb
i
told
him
even
if
you
do
nt
dance
off
up
in
quentin
you
have
such
a
bleak
long
lonely
time
ahead
of
you
his
cigarette
jerked
and
dropped
ash
on
his
vest
i
said
take
the
air
he
growled
suddenly
dust
i
got
enough
chinning
with
you
beat
it
okey
i
stood
up
and
went
over
to
the
tall
oak
desk
and
took
his
two
guns
out
of
my
pockets
laid
them
side
by
side
on
the
blotter
so
that
the
barrels
were
exactly
parallel
i
reached
my
hat
off
the
floor
beside
the
davenport
and
started
for
the
door
brody
yelped
hey
i
turned
and
waited
his
cigarette
was
jiggling
like
a
doll
on
a
coiled
spring
everything
s
smooth
ai
nt
it
he
asked
why
sure
this
is
a
free
country
you
do
nt
have
to
stay
out
of
jail
if
you
do
nt
want
to
that
is
if
you
re
a
citizen
are
you
a
citizen
he
just
stared
at
me
jiggling
the
cigarette
the
blonde
agnes
turned
her
head
slowly
and
stared
at
me
along
the
same
level
their
doubt
and
frustrated
anger
agnes
reached
her
silvery
nails
up
abruptly
and
yanked
a
hair
out
of
her
head
and
broke
it
between
her
fingers
with
a
bitter
jerk
brody
said
tightly
you
re
not
going
to
any
cops
in
other
not
if
it
s
the
sternwoods
you
re
working
for
i
ve
got
too
much
stuff
on
that
family
you
got
your
pictures
and
you
got
your
hush
go
and
peddle
your
papers
make
your
mind
up
i
said
you
told
me
to
dust
i
was
on
my
way
out
you
hollered
at
me
and
i
stopped
and
now
i
m
on
my
way
out
again
is
that
what
you
want
you
ai
nt
got
anything
on
me
brody
said
just
a
couple
of
murders
small
change
in
your
circle
he
did
nt
jump
more
than
an
inch
but
it
looked
like
a
foot
the
white
cornea
showed
all
around
the
tobacco
colored
iris
of
his
eyes
the
in
the
lamplight
blonde
agnes
let
out
a
low
animal
wail
and
buried
her
head
in
a
cushion
on
the
end
of
the
davenport
i
stood
there
and
admired
the
long
line
of
her
thighs
brody
moistened
his
lips
slowly
and
said
sit
down
pal
maybe
i
have
a
little
more
for
you
what
s
that
crack
about
two
murders
mean
i
leaned
against
the
door
where
were
you
last
night
about
seven
thirty
joe
his
mouth
drooped
sulkily
and
he
stared
down
at
the
floor
i
was
watching
a
guy
a
guy
who
had
a
nice
racket
i
figured
he
needed
a
partner
in
geiger
i
was
watching
him
now
and
then
to
see
had
he
any
tough
connections
i
figure
he
has
friends
or
he
do
nt
work
the
racket
as
open
as
he
does
but
they
do
nt
go
to
his
house
only
dames
you
did
nt
watch
hard
enough
i
said
go
on
i
m
s
raining
hard
and
i
m
buttoned
up
in
my
coupe
and
i
do
nt
see
anything
there
s
a
car
in
front
of
geiger
s
and
another
car
a
little
way
up
the
hill
that
s
why
i
stay
down
below
there
s
a
big
buick
parked
down
where
i
am
and
after
a
while
i
go
over
and
take
a
gander
into
it
it
s
registered
to
vivian
pregan
nothing
happens
so
i
scram
that
s
all
i
le
waved
his
cigarette
his
eyes
crawled
up
and
down
my
face
could
be
i
said
know
where
that
buick
is
now
why
would
i
in
the
sheriff
s
garage
it
was
lifted
out
of
twelve
feet
of
water
off
lido
fish
pier
this
a
m
there
was
a
dead
man
in
it
he
had
been
sapped
and
the
car
pointed
out
the
pier
and
the
hand
throttle
pulled
down
brody
was
breathing
hard
one
of
his
feet
tapped
restlessly
jesus
guy
you
ca
nt
why
not
this
buick
was
down
back
of
geiger
s
according
to
you
well
mrs
regan
did
nt
have
it
out
her
chauffeur
a
lad
named
owen
taylor
had
it
out
he
went
over
to
geiger
s
place
to
have
words
with
him
because
owen
taylor
was
sweet
on
carmen
and
he
did
nt
like
the
kind
of
games
geiger
was
playing
with
her
he
let
himself
in
the
back
way
with
a
jimmy
and
a
gun
and
he
caught
geiger
taking
a
photo
of
carmen
without
any
clothes
on
so
his
gun
went
off
as
guns
will
and
geiger
fell
down
dead
and
owen
ran
away
but
not
without
the
photo
negative
geiger
had
just
taken
so
you
ran
after
him
and
took
the
photo
from
him
how
else
would
you
have
got
hold
of
it
brody
licked
his
lips
yeah
he
said
but
that
do
nt
make
me
knock
him
off
sure
i
heard
the
shots
and
saw
this
killer
come
slamming
down
took
out
after
him
he
hit
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
and
went
west
on
sunset
beyond
beverly
hills
he
skidded
off
the
road
and
had
to
stop
and
i
came
up
and
played
copper
he
had
a
gun
but
his
nerve
was
bad
and
i
sapped
him
down
so
i
went
through
his
clothes
and
found
out
who
he
was
and
i
lifted
the
plateholder
just
out
of
curiosity
i
was
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
and
getting
my
neck
wet
when
he
came
out
of
it
all
of
a
sudden
and
knocked
me
off
the
car
he
was
out
of
sight
when
i
picked
myself
up
that
s
the
last
i
saw
of
him
how
did
you
know
it
was
geiger
he
shot
i
asked
gruffly
brody
shrugged
i
figure
it
was
but
i
can
be
wrong
when
i
had
the
plate
developed
and
he
stood
there
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
absentmindedly
pulling
his
greatcoat
around
his
throat
the
tight
composure
he
held
on
himself
fell
away
he
was
a
cruelly
driven
man
he
moved
toward
the
door
and
st
george
spoke
to
him
quietly
at
once
the
restraint
drew
his
face
together
like
a
mask
fitted
on
oh
good
evening
st
george
i
ve
been
trying
to
get
some
information
about
these
accursed
trains
so
i
can
bring
my
wife
and
son
back
from
the
valley
i
think
we
re
going
to
have
some
action
up
there
from
this
man
jackson
when
the
weather
breaks
and
my
wife
s
family
are
in
a
danger
zone
but
i
ca
nt
get
a
thing
out
of
the
virginia
central
i
suppose
you
were
down
watching
them
bring
in
young
wise
st
george
nodded
a
dreadful
thing
jennings
wise
was
a
fine
boy
a
very
promising
one
and
i
do
nt
mean
only
as
an
officer
he
was
one
of
the
best
newspaper
editors
we
had
in
the
state
did
you
know
his
father
no
but
he
was
in
the
office
before
he
took
his
men
to
roanoke
island
begging
benjamin
for
reinforcements
benjamin
talked
and
said
nothing
as
usual
very
suave
and
diplomatic
about
it
all
and
went
back
to
his
madeira
and
havanas
while
the
blues
were
wiped
out
it
was
all
a
very
bad
business
terrible
terrible
there
was
a
pause
can
i
offer
you
a
lift
in
my
carriage
virginius
asked
abruptly
thank
you
virginius
i
had
intended
walking
with
the
escort
but
i
m
chilled
to
the
bone
st
george
passed
through
the
door
which
virginius
kirby
at
the
carriage
virginius
hesitated
then
said
would
you
care
to
come
to
my
home
and
have
a
nightcap
with
me
i
have
one
bottle
left
of
excellent
old
marquis
de
pombal
and
you
ve
never
been
in
my
home
you
know
st
george
understood
at
a
glance
that
the
man
wanted
companionship
i
should
be
delighted
virginius
they
sank
back
in
the
cushions
and
virginius
pulled
about
them
a
thick
laprobe
yes
it
was
a
terrible
business
virginius
went
on
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
roanoke
island
opens
the
way
to
norfolk
and
it
could
have
been
held
i
ve
never
regarded
ex
governor
wise
highly
as
a
military
man
but
apparently
the
blues
and
the
other
troops
did
all
that
was
humanly
possible
i
ca
nt
understand
why
benjamin
did
nothing
what
can
he
do
it
s
not
the
war
department
it
s
the
administration
davis
is
running
everything
and
according
to
him
and
his
ideals
re
defending
our
rights
i
used
to
complain
about
the
way
remminger
ran
the
treasury
department
but
it
s
no
use
he
s
just
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
president
like
benjamin
and
all
the
others
the
place
where
benjamin
would
be
really
useful
is
the
diplomatic
service
he
has
that
type
of
brain
he
s
shrewd
patient
and
devious
he
s
too
devious
for
our
good
i
do
nt
trust
him
no
virginius
i
think
he
s
honest
and
he
would
have
been
a
far
better
man
to
send
to
england
than
mason
if
davis
were
shrewd
he
would
ve
sent
benjamin
to
europe
while
the
yankees
had
mason
and
slidell
in
prison
that
s
when
we
had
england
s
sympathy
do
nt
you
think
we
have
it
now
they
re
debating
recognizing
us
and
they
ll
keep
on
debating
until
they
see
which
side
wins
the
united
states
has
backed
down
and
england
has
saved
interests
and
only
that
but
good
god
they
ve
got
to
have
cotton
that
s
what
everybody
thinks
st
george
snorted
do
nt
you
think
england
would
rather
have
a
few
mills
shut
for
a
while
than
to
make
an
enemy
of
the
united
states
they
re
giving
it
a
long
view
if
they
gave
it
a
long
enough
view
they
d
see
that
would
risk
their
textile
markets
they
re
not
seeing
it
that
long
virginius
lord
john
russell
wants
to
make
a
good
showing
for
queen
victoria
while
he
s
alive
textile
markets
will
be
something
for
other
generations
to
worry
about
no
we
lost
our
chance
with
cotton
when
we
did
nt
borrow
their
gold
with
cotton
security
it
s
too
late
now
with
the
blockade
tightening
the
way
it
is
damn
that
blockade
dumping
ships
full
of
rocks
in
charleston
harbor
are
we
to
go
on
forever
making
speeches
about
our
our
commerce
and
overruns
our
country
the
way
they
re
winning
in
the
west
all
of
tennessee
and
kentucky
will
soon
be
open
to
the
scoundrels
anyway
we
probably
have
a
new
war
secretary
now
public
clamor
will
force
benjamin
to
resign
that
does
nt
get
us
back
all
the
months
we
ve
lost
proving
to
the
world
that
we
re
nonaggressors
while
they
plan
another
on
to
richmond
as
soon
as
spring
comes
no
and
it
does
nt
get
us
back
roanoke
island
and
the
men
we
lost
there
i
met
a
young
man
in
the
blues
on
secession
night
who
i
understand
was
wounded
and
captured
there
leatherbury
his
name
was
you
know
him
leatherbury
oh
yes
i
ve
heard
of
him
very
curious
st
george
waited
the
carriage
drew
to
a
stop
at
the
curb
well
here
we
are
virginius
offered
st
george
the
street
a
flagstone
court
in
front
enclosed
by
a
tall
iron
railed
fence
marble
blocks
on
either
side
of
the
stone
steps
projected
almost
to
the
gate
a
low
light
burned
in
the
hallway
and
st
george
noticed
that
the
brass
on
the
white
door
needed
attention
inside
the
house
was
not
too
warm
and
virginius
hurried
into
the
library
talking
nervously
i
ve
had
to
let
my
butler
and
housemaid
go
the
groom
doubles
in
brass
on
special
occasions
but
i
ca
nt
bother
him
after
a
night
like
this
the
cook
poor
soul
is
worn
out
by
taking
care
of
the
whole
with
large
dark
eyes
that
now
gazed
at
him
worshipfully
eliza
was
a
servant
girl
who
had
migrated
from
england
when
she
saw
brigham
in
nauvoo
she
fell
in
love
with
him
she
had
read
in
the
old
testament
that
persons
sometimes
served
seven
years
for
what
they
wanted
whereupon
she
had
gone
to
brigham
s
mary
ann
angel
known
to
everyone
as
mother
young
and
asked
if
she
could
serve
seven
years
in
her
house
and
then
become
one
of
brigham
s
wives
how
eliza
had
learned
that
plural
marriage
existed
in
nauvoo
brigham
did
not
know
if
she
wanted
to
serve
by
all
means
to
do
so
and
here
she
was
humbly
gazing
at
him
and
with
five
years
of
servitude
ahead
of
her
what
he
said
did
you
come
for
i
want
to
be
near
you
even
if
you
starve
to
death
yes
brother
brigham
well
you
probably
will
after
inspecting
the
company
that
had
moved
in
he
summoned
porter
go
to
nauvoo
and
fetch
the
mail
tell
the
rest
of
the
saints
to
stay
there
until
i
order
them
to
come
tell
dan
wells
that
is
my
command
and
i
want
no
more
damned
foolishness
tell
him
we
re
all
freezing
and
starving
to
death
out
here
i
ll
tell
him
and
make
him
understand
that
i
mean
it
i
will
but
you
know
dan
wells
is
pigheaded
it
was
not
the
pigheadedness
of
dan
wells
the
saints
in
nauvoo
felt
deserted
few
belongings
into
anything
they
could
find
on
wheels
and
were
setting
out
desperately
to
overtake
brigham
porter
said
the
road
from
nauvoo
to
brigham
s
camp
was
lined
with
them
company
by
company
they
were
pushing
forward
through
the
rain
and
the
mud
when
he
learned
that
fifteen
thousand
of
his
people
were
on
the
way
to
overtake
him
or
soon
would
be
brigham
was
speechless
anger
was
his
first
emotion
but
after
a
few
minutes
porter
saw
in
brigham
s
eyes
something
that
was
like
a
mist
of
tears
then
suddenly
and
still
without
having
said
a
word
brigham
turned
away
he
realized
now
what
a
stupendous
task
he
had
on
his
hands
pit
was
the
measure
of
the
man
that
he
did
not
flinch
on
the
contrary
he
moved
with
twice
his
customary
vigor
realizing
that
he
must
push
forward
at
once
before
the
oncoming
horde
could
overtake
his
camp
for
four
days
with
superhuman
effort
he
went
ahead
but
on
chariton
river
he
was
again
forced
to
halt
that
the
teams
floundered
and
sank
and
some
of
the
smaller
carts
all
but
disappeared
streams
were
so
dangerous
that
when
fording
was
attempted
several
of
the
beasts
were
drowned
for
a
week
brigham
remained
on
the
bank
of
the
chariton
thinking
of
his
problems
and
wondering
how
many
bridges
he
would
have
to
build
he
wanted
a
water
route
but
the
reports
of
lewis
and
clark
and
others
declared
there
was
none
after
a
week
he
had
a
bridge
across
the
chariton
and
pushed
forward
to
locust
river
and
stopped
again
provisionswere
low
every
person
in
camp
looked
emaciated
some
were
too
weakened
for
labor
knowing
that
his
whole
camp
would
die
of
famine
if
he
did
not
act
quickly
he
sent
scouts
in
all
directions
and
porter
returned
with
good
news
thirty
miles
westward
he
said
there
was
fertile
land
adjacent
to
a
beautiful
campsite
this
the
camp
reached
after
wallowing
in
mudholes
for
another
week
for
two
months
it
had
been
on
the
road
and
was
still
less
than
clayton
solemnly
observed
in
his
journal
made
an
average
of
two
and
one
half
miles
a
day
to
brigham
he
said
we
ll
be
ten
years
reaching
the
rocky
mountains
and
he
gazed
at
the
fine
cloth
of
his
trousers
which
water
and
mud
had
ruined
how
long
was
abraham
on
the
road
not
ten
years
i
hope
cheer
up
brother
william
we
ll
be
there
in
five
clayton
gazed
toward
nauvoo
where
his
favorite
wife
was
soon
to
have
a
child
five
years
he
said
you
do
nt
mean
it
i
mean
said
brigham
we
ll
get
there
if
it
takes
us
forever
the
new
site
was
so
beautiful
that
the
saints
called
it
garden
grove
on
all
sides
grassy
and
flowered
hills
rolled
away
in
thousands
of
untilled
acres
right
here
brigham
said
they
would
plow
the
sod
and
plant
crops
and
within
a
week
the
area
had
been
transformed
eight
miles
and
everywhere
ox
teams
drew
plows
through
the
rich
earth
while
other
teams
dragged
harrows
behind
men
who
sowed
seed
from
their
hands
five
thousand
exiles
were
converted
into
an
agricultural
camp
while
hundreds
planted
others
gathered
and
hewed
timbers
and
built
storehouses
and
some
chosen
for
their
skill
with
rifles
went
out
daily
to
hunt
wild
game
women
repaired
garments
nursed
the
sick
and
cooked
the
meals
and
children
scattered
in
search
of
edible
roots
and
wild
fruits
one
man
set
up
a
shop
to
mend
shoes
another
a
forge
and
blacksmith
shop
and
a
third
tanned
deer
hides
and
made
moccasins
and
gloves
no
one
except
the
sick
was
idle
if
a
man
did
not
work
brigham
said
he
would
not
eat
and
his
word
was
absolute
law
almost
daily
he
sat
as
counselor
and
judge
to
hear
tales
of
theft
of
ill
will
of
petty
woes
one
of
the
brothers
said
parley
had
challenged
another
to
a
duel
for
what
a
quarrel
he
wants
vengeance
nobody
fights
duels
in
this
camp
send
him
here
the
challenger
came
sulking
and
obstinate
with
the
light
of
murder
in
his
eyes
what
in
hell
demanded
brigham
are
you
up
to
ca
nt
you
mind
your
own
damned
business
i
do
but
no
man
can
call
me
a
lousy
bastard
and
live
brigham
gazed
at
the
man
he
was
hulking
and
evil
tempered
and
had
an
old
scar
above
his
left
eye
no
man
in
this
camp
can
challenge
another
to
a
duel
you
go
at
once
recommended
the
i
avies
tavern
six
miles
out
of
williamsburg
as
a
small
quiet
place
where
he
could
likely
have
a
good
sleep
and
he
started
late
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
with
this
as
his
objective
but
when
he
pulled
up
before
the
door
at
the
end
of
an
afternoon
of
snow
that
had
changed
to
sleet
and
later
settled
to
a
drizzle
of
rain
his
satisfaction
oozed
away
with
the
cold
drip
from
his
hat
a
drove
of
cattle
stamped
and
lowed
in
a
paddock
behind
the
house
and
when
he
entered
the
small
taproom
seemed
full
of
men
with
cow
dung
on
their
feet
its
acrid
odor
mingled
with
the
stench
of
sweat
and
of
wet
wool
coats
smote
him
in
the
face
he
would
have
gone
out
gain
for
all
the
lateness
of
the
hour
if
the
host
had
not
pushed
through
between
the
tables
lean
freckled
face
we
have
a
crowd
in
here
sure
enough
sir
he
said
in
answer
to
the
expression
in
matthew
s
eyes
but
above
i
have
a
room
with
a
good
bed
and
a
fire
laid
that
old
jim
can
light
in
jig
time
sir
i
f
the
young
gentleman
will
follow
me
your
supper
can
be
brought
up
there
sir
it
s
a
bad
night
sir
he
went
on
as
matthew
hesitated
and
there
s
no
other
inn
between
here
and
the
city
i
ll
have
a
chicken
for
you
if
you
say
the
word
sir
matthew
grinned
for
the
man
was
oddly
importunate
as
if
it
really
mattered
to
him
even
with
a
full
house
whether
one
guest
ent
or
stayed
i
ll
certainly
say
the
word
then
whatever
it
may
be
i
have
a
gorse
outside
can
you
look
after
him
too
yes
sir
i
can
sure
enough
gro
leaning
against
a
corner
of
the
bar
light
the
fire
upstairs
r
the
young
gentleman
and
then
take
care
of
his
horse
the
tree
of
liberty
the
negro
with
a
tug
at
a
grizzled
forelock
started
at
once
up
the
stairs
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
matthew
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
freckled
man
who
wedged
a
passage
for
him
between
the
chairs
above
a
little
hallway
ended
in
an
open
door
through
which
came
a
flickering
light
the
freckled
man
led
the
way
inside
a
room
of
fair
size
which
evidently
ran
the
width
of
the
house
matthew
stared
at
a
large
white
blur
and
made
out
a
bed
curtained
against
the
drafts
beyond
it
was
the
dark
shadow
of
a
chest
of
drawers
and
at
the
far
end
the
pallid
outline
of
a
fan
window
here
on
the
right
old
jim
knelt
on
the
hearth
encouraging
a
tiny
flame
in
a
cavern
of
a
fireplace
with
a
pair
of
bellows
the
freckled
faced
man
bustled
about
lighting
candles
his
apron
still
with
his
air
of
serving
a
potentate
you
have
it
all
to
yourself
up
here
sir
mrs
davies
and
i
have
our
rooms
over
the
kitchen
you
ll
find
the
drovers
leave
at
daylight
and
if
you
just
draw
the
curtains
sir
you
ought
to
get
a
good
nap
of
sleep
after
they
leave
from
the
look
of
your
bed
i
have
it
in
mind
i
might
sleep
the
clock
around
matthew
asserted
you
are
mr
davies
humphrey
davies
sir
and
very
much
at
your
service
odd
the
way
the
fellow
kept
bowing
and
smiling
if
he
went
on
much
longer
matthew
would
feel
out
of
place
in
spite
of
his
green
coat
and
silver
buttons
a
clatter
and
splash
of
horses
hoofs
outside
and
the
sound
of
a
door
below
being
thrown
violently
open
caught
their
ears
and
set
davies
to
bowing
again
if
there
s
nothing
more
sir
davies
coming
sir
called
the
innkeeper
and
with
a
final
bow
he
was
gone
turning
to
the
fireplace
matthew
found
the
negro
had
vanished
as
well
and
without
instructions
for
ranger
s
care
he
caught
up
the
cloak
he
had
laid
aside
and
groped
his
way
along
the
passage
to
the
stairs
he
would
see
to
his
horse
himself
halfway
down
the
stair
he
paused
for
three
strangers
and
davies
effectually
blocked
the
foot
as
matthew
arrived
one
of
the
strangers
pushed
aside
three
mugs
to
make
a
place
for
himself
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
table
to
matthew
s
astonishment
instead
of
roughly
hustling
him
off
his
perch
the
three
drovers
rescued
their
drinks
from
overturning
without
comment
and
crowded
together
uncomfortably
to
give
the
stranger
room
talk
in
the
inn
had
ceased
and
all
the
men
were
staring
at
the
newcomers
but
there
was
no
hint
of
resentment
in
the
stare
the
firelight
fell
full
on
the
man
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
divergent
roots
table
touching
the
indolent
grace
the
pride
in
the
thin
face
the
high
bridged
nose
and
fine
dark
eyes
under
arched
brows
that
lifted
at
the
corners
the
man
looked
like
an
eagle
matthew
thought
his
smile
as
he
spoke
was
charming
firefly
went
lame
four
miles
back
davies
and
we
ve
been
limping
along
for
an
hour
keeping
up
our
spirits
with
thoughts
of
your
room
upstairs
the
innkeeper
s
face
was
a
profile
of
sympathetic
regret
as
matthew
could
see
i
m
sorry
sir
but
it
will
do
very
well
for
one
night
davies
i
ve
sent
xenophon
to
elm
hill
for
another
mount
and
he
ll
be
back
by
morning
if
you
ca
nt
bear
the
thought
of
three
of
us
in
that
bed
of
yours
make
up
a
pallet
on
the
settle
man
only
clear
the
stairway
for
god
s
sake
and
let
us
get
out
of
this
filthy
atmosphere
he
rose
from
the
table
and
with
a
shock
matthew
realized
he
was
he
managed
clumsily
humphrey
davies
was
bowing
protestingly
i
m
sorry
sir
indeed
i
am
it
s
not
the
bed
sir
but
matthew
descended
the
stair
to
lay
a
hand
on
the
paris
that
if
they
came
back
to
juan
would
have
to
know
the
arts
of
love
if
