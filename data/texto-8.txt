from
that
of
their
cultured
ancestors
of
the
nineteenth
than
did
that
of
the
latter
from
the
language
of
washington
and
franklin
while
the
differences
between
the
style
of
dress
and
furniture
of
the
two
epochs
are
not
more
marked
than
i
have
known
fashion
to
make
in
the
time
of
one
generation
chapter
v
when
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
ladies
retired
leaving
dr
leete
and
myself
alone
he
sounded
me
as
to
my
disposition
for
sleep
saying
that
if
i
felt
like
it
my
bed
was
ready
for
me
but
if
i
was
inclined
to
wakefulness
nothing
would
please
him
better
than
to
bear
me
company
i
am
a
late
bird
myself
he
said
and
without
suspicion
of
flattery
i
may
say
that
a
companion
more
interesting
than
yourself
could
scarcely
be
imagined
it
is
decidedly
not
often
that
one
has
a
chance
to
converse
with
had
been
looking
forward
all
the
evening
with
some
dread
to
the
time
when
i
should
be
alone
on
retiring
for
the
night
surrounded
by
these
most
friendly
strangers
stimulated
and
supported
by
their
sympathetic
interest
i
had
been
able
to
keep
my
mental
balance
even
then
however
in
pauses
of
the
conversation
i
had
had
glimpses
vivid
as
lightning
flashes
of
the
horror
of
strangeness
that
was
waiting
to
be
faced
when
i
could
no
longer
command
diversion
i
knew
i
could
not
sleep
that
night
and
as
for
lying
awake
and
thinking
it
argues
no
cowardice
i
am
sure
to
confess
that
i
was
afraid
of
it
when
in
reply
to
my
host
s
question
i
frankly
told
him
this
he
replied
that
it
would
be
strange
if
i
did
not
feel
just
so
but
that
i
need
have
no
anxiety
about
sleeping
whenever
i
wanted
to
go
to
bed
he
would
give
me
a
dose
which
would
insure
me
a
sound
night
s
sleep
without
fail
the
feeling
of
an
old
citizen
before
i
acquire
that
i
replied
i
must
know
a
little
more
about
the
sort
of
boston
i
have
come
back
to
you
told
me
when
we
were
upon
the
house
top
that
though
a
century
only
had
elapsed
since
i
fell
asleep
it
had
been
marked
by
greater
changes
in
the
conditions
of
humanity
than
many
a
previous
millennium
with
the
city
before
me
i
could
well
believe
that
but
i
am
very
curious
to
know
what
some
of
the
changes
have
been
to
make
a
beginning
somewhere
for
the
subject
is
doubtless
a
large
one
what
solution
if
any
have
you
found
for
the
labor
question
it
was
the
sphinx
s
riddle
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
when
i
dropped
out
the
sphinx
was
threatening
to
devour
society
because
the
answer
was
not
forthcoming
it
is
well
worth
sleeping
a
hundred
years
to
learn
what
the
right
answer
was
if
indeed
you
have
found
it
yet
as
no
such
replied
dr
leete
and
there
is
no
way
in
which
it
could
arise
i
suppose
we
may
claim
to
have
solved
it
society
would
indeed
have
fully
deserved
being
devoured
if
it
had
failed
to
answer
a
riddle
so
entirely
simple
in
fact
to
speak
by
the
book
it
was
not
necessary
for
society
to
solve
the
riddle
at
all
it
may
be
said
to
have
solved
itself
the
solution
came
as
the
result
of
a
process
of
industrial
evolution
which
could
not
have
terminated
otherwise
all
that
society
had
to
do
was
to
recognize
and
cooperate
with
that
evolution
when
its
tendency
had
become
unmistakable
i
can
only
say
i
answered
that
at
the
time
i
fell
asleep
no
such
evolution
had
been
recognized
it
was
in
that
you
fell
into
this
sleep
i
think
you
said
yes
may
th
my
companion
regarded
me
musingly
for
some
moments
then
he
observed
and
you
tell
me
that
of
the
crisis
which
society
was
nearing
of
course
i
fully
credit
your
statement
the
singular
blindness
of
your
contemporaries
to
the
signs
of
the
times
is
a
phenomenon
commented
on
by
many
of
our
historians
but
few
facts
of
history
are
more
difficult
for
us
to
realize
so
obvious
and
unmistakable
as
we
look
back
seem
the
indications
which
must
also
have
come
under
your
eyes
of
the
transformation
about
to
come
to
pass
i
should
be
interested
mr
west
if
you
would
give
me
a
little
more
definite
idea
of
the
view
which
you
and
men
of
your
grade
of
intellect
took
of
the
state
and
prospects
of
society
in
you
must
at
least
have
realized
that
the
widespread
industrial
and
social
troubles
and
the
underlying
dissatisfaction
of
all
classes
with
the
inequalities
of
society
and
the
general
misery
of
mankind
were
portents
of
great
changes
of
some
sort
we
did
indeed
fully
realize
that
i
replied
we
felt
that
society
was
dragging
would
drift
nobody
could
say
but
all
feared
the
rocks
nevertheless
said
dr
leete
the
set
of
the
current
was
perfectly
perceptible
if
you
had
but
taken
pains
to
observe
it
and
it
was
not
toward
the
rocks
but
toward
a
deeper
channel
we
had
a
popular
proverb
i
replied
that
hindsight
is
better
than
foresight
the
force
of
which
i
shall
now
no
doubt
appreciate
more
fully
than
ever
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
prospect
was
such
when
i
went
into
that
long
sleep
that
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
had
i
looked
down
from
your
house
top
to
day
on
a
heap
of
charred
and
moss
grown
ruins
instead
of
this
glorious
city
dr
leete
had
listened
to
me
with
close
attention
and
nodded
thoughtfully
as
i
finished
speaking
what
you
have
said
he
observed
will
be
regarded
as
a
most
valuable
vindication
of
storiot
whose
account
of
your
era
has
been
generally
thought
exaggerated
in
minds
that
a
period
of
transition
like
that
should
be
full
of
excitement
and
agitation
was
indeed
to
be
looked
for

chapter
i
the
finding
of
the
copper
cylinder
it
occurred
as
far
back
as
february
it
happened
on
that
day
that
the
yacht
falcon
lay
becalmed
upon
the
ocean
between
the
canaries
and
the
madeira
islands
this
yacht
falcon
was
the
property
of
lord
featherstone
who
being
weary
of
life
in
england
had
taken
a
few
congenial
friends
for
a
winter
s
cruise
in
these
southern
latitudes
they
had
visited
the
azores
the
canaries
and
the
madeira
islands
and
were
now
on
their
way
to
the
mediterranean
the
wind
had
failed
a
deep
calm
had
succeeded
and
everywhere
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
water
was
smooth
and
glassy
the
yacht
rose
and
fell
at
the
impulse
of
the
long
ocean
undulations
and
the
creaking
of
the
spars
sounded
out
a
lazy
accompaniment
to
the
motion
of
the
vessel
all
around
was
a
watery
horizon
except
in
the
one
place
only
toward
the
south
where
far
in
the
distance
the
peak
of
teneriffe
rose
into
the
slow
pitching
of
the
yacht
and
the
dull
creaking
of
the
spars
all
combined
to
lull
into
a
state
of
indolent
repose
the
people
on
board
forward
were
the
crew
some
asleep
others
smoking
others
playing
cards
at
the
stern
were
oxenden
the
intimate
friend
of
featherstone
and
dr
congreve
who
had
come
in
the
double
capacity
of
friend
and
medical
attendant
these
two
like
the
crew
were
in
a
state
of
dull
and
languid
repose
suspended
between
the
two
masts
in
an
indian
hammock
lay
featherstone
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
novel
in
his
hand
which
he
was
pretending
to
read
the
fourth
member
of
the
party
melick
was
seated
near
the
mainmast
folding
some
papers
in
a
peculiar
way
his
occupation
at
length
attracted
the
roving
eyes
of
featherstone
who
poked
forth
his
head
from
his
hammock
and
said
in
a
sleepy
voice
i
say
melick
you
re
the
most
energetic
fellah
i
ever
saw
s
busy
what
are
you
doing
paper
boats
said
melick
in
a
business
like
tone
paper
boats
by
jove
said
featherstone
what
for
i
m
going
to
have
a
regatta
said
melick
anything
to
kill
time
you
know
by
jove
exclaimed
featherstone
again
raising
himself
higher
in
his
hammock
that
s
not
a
bad
idea
a
wegatta
by
jove
glowious
glowious
i
say
oxenden
did
you
hear
that
what
do
you
mean
by
a
regatta
asked
oxenden
lazily
oh
i
mean
a
race
with
these
paper
boats
we
can
bet
on
them
you
know
at
this
featherstone
sat
upright
with
his
legs
dangling
out
of
the
hammock
by
jove
he
exclaimed
again
betting
so
we
can
do
you
know
melick
old
chap
i
think
that
s
a
wegular
piece
of
the
best
boat
but
there
is
nt
any
wind
said
oxenden
well
you
know
that
s
the
fun
of
it
said
melick
who
went
solemnly
on
as
he
spoke
folding
his
paper
boats
that
s
the
fun
of
it
for
you
see
if
there
was
a
wind
we
should
be
going
on
ourselves
and
the
regatta
could
nt
come
off
but
as
it
is
the
water
is
just
right
you
pick
out
your
boat
and
lay
your
bet
on
her
to
race
to
some
given
point
a
given
point
but
how
can
we
find
any
oh
easily
enough
something
or
anything
a
bubble
ll
do
or
we
can
pitch
out
a
bit
of
wood
upon
this
featherstone
descended
from
his
perch
and
came
near
to
examine
the
proceedings
while
the
other
two
eager
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
excitement
soon
joined
him
by
this
time
melick
had
finished
his
paper
boats
of
different
colors
namely
red
green
yellow
and
white
i
ll
put
these
in
the
water
said
melick
and
then
we
can
lay
our
bets
on
them
as
we
choose
but
first
let
us
see
if
there
is
anything
that
can
be
taken
as
a
point
of
arrival
if
there
is
nt
anything
i
can
pitch
out
a
bit
of
wood
in
any
direction
which
may
seem
best
saying
this
he
went
to
the
side
followed
by
the
others
and
all
looked
out
carefully
over
the
water
there
s
a
black
speck
out
there
said
oxenden
so
there
is
said
featherstone
that
ll
do
i
wonder
what
it
is
oh
a
bit
of
timber
said
melick
probably
the
spar
of
some
ship
it
do
nt
look
like
a
spar
said
the
doctor
it
s
only
a
round
spot
like
the
float
of
some
net
said
melick
it
s
one
end
of
it
the
rest
is
under
water
the
spot
thus
chosen
was
a
dark
circular
object
about
a
hundred
yards
away
and
certainly
did
look
very
much
like
the
extremity
of
some
spar
the
rest
of
which
was
under
water
whatever
it
was
however
it
served
well
enough
for
their
present
purpose
and
no
one
took
any
further
interest
in
it
except
as
the
point
toward
which
the
paper
boats
should
run
in
their
eventful
race
melick
now
let
himself
down
over
the
yet
it
does
not
matter
we
love
each
other
we
know
we
do
nt
think
alike
on
doctrinal
points
but
we
love
each
other
she
stopped
a
moment
at
the
lumber
yard
the
ghastly
blackness
of
the
ruin
glared
against
the
snow
covered
hills
and
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
sky
here
and
there
a
puff
of
steam
showed
where
the
melting
snow
on
the
cooler
beams
dripped
on
the
hot
embers
below
some
scattered
groups
of
lumbermen
and
their
forlorn
wives
braved
the
cold
and
stood
talking
the
fire
over
for
after
all
it
was
the
immediate
interest
death
would
not
come
to
them
for
years
perhaps
but
where
were
they
going
to
get
money
for
their
families
during
the
spring
there
could
be
no
rafting
down
the
river
until
after
the
loggers
had
brought
their
rafts
from
up
in
the
mountains
to
be
sawed
into
planks
alfaretta
s
father
who
stood
contemplating
the
ruins
and
moralizing
when
any
one
would
stop
to
listen
to
him
had
pointed
this
out
mr
dean
was
a
carpenter
he
could
pity
the
lumbermen
from
the
shelter
of
comparative
affluence
when
he
saw
the
preacher
s
wife
he
came
over
to
speak
to
her
well
ma
am
he
said
the
dispensations
of
providence
is
indeed
mysterious
that
the
river
should
have
been
froze
last
night
mr
dean
had
a
habit
of
holding
his
mouth
open
a
moment
before
he
spoke
and
looking
as
though
he
felt
that
his
listener
was
impatient
for
his
words
which
were
always
pronounced
with
great
deliberation
helen
had
very
little
patience
with
him
and
used
to
answer
his
slowly
uttered
remarks
with
a
quickness
which
confused
him
it
would
be
more
mysterious
if
it
were
not
frozen
at
this
time
of
year
she
replied
almost
before
he
had
finished
speaking
she
was
in
haste
to
reach
mrs
davis
and
she
had
no
time
to
hear
elder
dean
s
platitudes
he
began
to
open
his
beak
like
mouth
in
an
astonished
way
when
a
by
stander
interrupted
him
i
suppose
this
easy
to
fall
into
pious
phraseology
in
the
presence
of
elder
dean
will
be
made
the
subject
of
the
prayer
meeting
to
night
it
will
said
mr
dean
solemnly
it
will
it
is
an
awful
example
to
unbelievers
an
it
is
a
lesson
to
the
owners
not
to
allow
smoking
in
the
yards
then
with
a
sharp
look
at
helen
out
of
his
narrow
eyes
he
added
i
have
nt
seen
you
at
prayer
meeting
lately
mrs
ward
it
is
a
blessed
place
a
blessed
place
the
lord
touches
sinners
hearts
with
a
live
coal
from
off
his
altar
souls
have
been
taught
to
walk
in
the
light
in
the
light
of
god
mr
dean
prolonged
the
last
word
in
an
unctuous
way
which
he
reserved
for
public
prayer
and
admonition
helen
did
not
answer
but
the
elder
was
not
rebuffed
i
hope
we
will
see
you
soon
he
said
a
solemn
season
of
revival
is
mrs
ward
annoyed
at
the
impertinence
of
his
questions
helen
s
face
flushed
a
little
i
do
not
like
the
prayer
meeting
she
answered
quietly
but
before
the
elder
could
recover
from
the
shock
of
such
a
statement
mrs
nevins
had
come
up
to
speak
to
him
have
you
seen
mrs
davis
yet
mr
dean
she
said
she
took
on
awful
last
night
the
neighbors
heard
her
t
was
after
twelve
fore
she
was
quiet
yes
i
saw
her
responded
the
elder
shaking
his
head
in
a
pompous
way
i
went
to
administer
consolation
i
m
just
coming
from
there
now
it
is
an
awful
judgment
on
that
man
no
chance
for
repentance
overtook
by
hell
as
i
told
mrs
davis
in
a
moment
but
the
lord
must
be
praised
for
his
justice
that
ought
to
comfort
her
good
heavens
cried
helen
you
did
not
tell
that
ma
am
said
mr
dean
fairly
stuttering
with
astonishment
at
the
condemnation
of
her
tone
i
i
did
oh
shame
helen
said
heedless
of
the
listeners
around
them
how
dared
you
say
such
a
thing
how
dared
you
libel
the
goodness
of
god
tom
davis
is
not
in
hell
a
man
who
died
to
save
another
s
life
who
would
want
the
heaven
of
such
a
god
oh
that
poor
wife
how
could
you
have
had
the
heart
to
make
her
think
god
was
so
cruel
there
was
a
dead
silence
elder
dean
was
too
dumfounded
to
speak
and
the
others
looking
at
helen
s
eyes
flashing
through
her
tears
of
passionate
pain
were
almost
persuaded
that
she
was
right
they
waited
to
hear
more
but
she
turned
and
hurried
away
her
breath
quick
and
a
tightened
feeling
in
her
throat
the
elder
was
the
first
to
break
the
spell
of
her
words
but
he
opened
his
lips
twice
before
a
tom
davis
not
in
hell
why
where
s
the
good
of
a
hell
at
all
then
helen
s
heart
was
burning
with
sympathy
for
the
sorrow
which
had
been
so
cruelly
wounded
she
had
forgotten
the
reserve
which
respect
for
her
husband
s
opinions
always
enforced
it
is
wicked
to
have
said
such
a
thing
she
thought
as
she
walked
rapidly
along
over
the
creaking
snow
i
will
tell
her
it
is
not
true
it
never
could
be
true
the
path
through
the
ragged
unkempt
garden
in
front
of
the
tenement
house
was
so
trodden
that
the
snow
was
packed
and
hard
the
gate
swung
back
with
a
jar
and
clatter
and
two
limp
frosted
hens
flew
shrieking
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
ash
heap
behind
it
the
door
was
open
and
helen
could
see
the
square
of
the
entry
papered
where
the
plaster
had
not
been
broken
away
with
pale
green
castles
embowered
in
livid
trees
on
either
side
was
the
entrance
to
a
tenement
a
coat
and
a
singed
and
battered
hat
here
helen
knocked
mrs
davis
was
in
the
small
inner
room
but
came
out
as
her
visitor
entered
wiping
more
the
pipe
of
the
boatswain
rang
through
the
vessel
and
all
hands
were
mustered
on
the
forecastle
the
tug
was
made
fast
on
the
quarter
of
the
steamer
and
no
one
from
her
had
come
on
board
captain
passford
and
christy
walked
forward
leaving
the
lady
with
her
own
thoughts
she
was
a
daughter
of
a
distinguished
officer
in
the
navy
and
she
had
been
fully
schooled
in
the
lesson
of
patriotism
for
such
an
emergency
as
the
present
she
was
sad
and
many
a
tear
dropped
from
her
still
handsome
face
but
she
was
brave
enough
to
feel
proud
that
she
had
a
husband
and
a
son
whom
she
was
willing
to
give
to
her
country
the
ship
s
company
gathered
on
the
forecastle
and
every
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
deeply
impressed
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
for
not
a
light
word
was
spoken
had
just
learned
that
the
country
was
in
a
state
of
war
and
the
present
occasion
indicated
that
the
owner
had
some
serious
question
in
his
mind
which
was
now
to
be
presented
to
them
the
bellevite
was
heavily
manned
for
a
yacht
but
every
person
had
been
selected
for
his
position
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
with
the
utmost
care
by
captain
breaker
assisted
by
the
owner
every
one
of
them
had
been
attached
to
the
steamer
for
at
least
a
year
and
some
of
them
for
a
longer
period
all
of
them
were
personally
known
to
the
owner
and
the
members
of
the
family
who
had
taken
the
greatest
pleasure
in
improving
and
assisting
them
and
their
families
if
they
had
any
they
were
all
devoted
to
the
owner
and
the
members
of
his
family
who
had
taken
such
a
strong
personal
interest
in
them
and
theirs
many
instances
of
the
kindness
of
the
lady
in
times
of
sickness
and
death
as
well
as
in
the
brighter
days
of
prosperity
and
happiness
this
generous
and
considerate
treatment
there
was
not
a
man
on
board
who
would
not
have
laid
down
his
life
for
the
family
it
was
certainly
a
model
ship
s
company
and
if
there
had
ever
been
another
owner
and
captain
like
those
of
the
bellevite
there
might
also
have
been
such
another
collection
of
officers
and
seamen
but
every
one
of
them
had
been
selected
for
his
moral
character
not
less
than
for
his
nautical
skill
and
knowledge
in
fact
the
personal
history
of
any
one
of
them
would
have
been
interesting
to
the
general
reader
these
men
composed
the
audience
of
captain
passford
when
he
took
his
place
at
the
bowsprit
bitts
and
if
the
occasion
had
been
less
solemn
they
would
have
cheered
him
as
they
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
on
every
suitable
opportunity
and
even
when
it
was
not
suitable
the
owner
prefaced
his
remarks
with
a
statement
of
the
events
which
had
occurred
in
the
country
since
the
last
dates
they
had
received
and
then
proceeded
to
describe
he
fully
stated
the
perils
of
the
enterprise
with
the
fact
that
his
operations
would
be
somewhat
irregular
though
he
intended
to
make
an
immediate
tender
of
the
vessel
to
the
government
with
his
own
services
in
any
capacity
in
which
he
might
be
needed
in
spite
of
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
the
men
broke
out
into
cheers
and
not
a
few
of
the
sailors
shouted
out
their
readiness
to
go
with
him
wherever
he
might
go
without
regard
to
danger
or
hardship
one
old
sheet
anchor
man
declared
that
he
was
ready
to
die
for
miss
florry
and
he
was
so
lustily
cheered
that
it
was
evident
this
was
the
sentiment
of
all
i
have
called
the
tug
at
the
quarter
alongside
to
convey
mrs
passford
to
the
shore
though
christy
will
go
with
me
added
the
owner
at
this
point
he
was
interrupted
by
a
volley
of
cheers
for
christy
was
a
universal
favorite
on
board
as
florry
had
always
been
and
the
ship
s
company
regarded
her
as
a
sort
with
the
most
profound
reverence
in
view
of
the
danger
and
the
irregularity
of
the
enterprise
i
shall
not
persuade
or
urge
any
person
on
board
to
accompany
me
and
the
tug
will
take
on
shore
all
who
prefer
to
leave
the
vessel
with
my
best
wishes
for
their
future
those
who
prefer
to
go
on
shore
will
go
aft
to
the
mainmast
continued
captain
passford
officers
and
seamen
looked
from
one
to
the
other
but
not
one
of
them
took
a
step
from
his
place
on
the
forecastle
to
which
all
seemed
to
be
nailed
chapter
iv
the
first
mission
of
the
bellevite
captain
passford
looked
over
his
audience
with
no
little
interest
and
perhaps
with
considerable
anxiety
for
he
felt
that
the
success
of
his
enterprise
must
depend
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
fidelity
and
skill
of
the
individual
members
of
the
ship
s
company
my
remarks
are
addressed
to
every
person
in
the
ship
s
company
from
captain
breaker
to
the
stewards
and
coal
passers
and
any
one
without
prejudice
to
his
present
or
future
interests
continued
the
owner
more
earnestly
than
before
the
officers
and
men
gazed
at
each
other
and
it
looked
as
though
not
one
of
them
dared
to
move
a
single
inch
lest
a
step
should
be
interpreted
as
an
impeachment
of
his
fidelity
to
one
who
had
been
a
christian
and
a
trusty
friend
in
all
his
relations
with
him
i
know
that
some
of
you
have
families
mothers
brothers
and
sisters
on
shore
and
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
not
regard
it
as
a
disgrace
or
a
stigma
upon
any
man
who
does
his
duty
as
he
understands
it
without
regard
to
me
or
mine
the
owner
proceeded
still
not
a
man
moved
and
all
seemed
to
be
more
averse
than
before
to
change
their
positions
a
particle
and
possibly
any
one
who
was
tempted
to
do
so
expected
to
be
hooted
by
his
shipmates
if
however
sam
had
heard
enough
of
the
conversation
between
weatherford
and
peter
mcqueen
the
other
great
half
breed
warrior
to
know
that
he
could
not
reach
the
fort
that
night
the
two
half
breeds
talked
most
of
the
a
large
body
of
indians
in
the
vicinity
who
were
scouring
the
country
around
fort
glass
sam
knew
enough
of
indian
warfare
to
know
that
there
would
be
numerous
small
parties
of
savage
scouts
lurking
immediately
around
the
fort
day
and
night
for
the
purpose
of
picking
off
any
daring
whites
who
might
venture
outside
the
gates
and
especially
any
messenger
who
might
attempt
to
pass
from
that
to
any
other
fortress
he
knew
therefore
that
for
some
time
to
come
it
would
be
impossible
to
reach
fort
glass
and
penetrating
the
woods
for
a
considerable
distance
he
stopped
and
sat
down
on
a
log
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
and
telling
his
companions
not
to
speak
to
him
as
he
wanted
to
think
chapter
v
sam
s
fortress
sam
s
companions
kept
perfectly
still
their
reverence
for
sam
had
grown
with
every
foot
of
their
travels
and
their
confidence
in
his
ability
to
get
out
of
any
difficulty
and
ultimately
to
accomplish
his
purposes
in
the
face
of
any
obstacle
was
now
it
was
impossible
to
reach
the
fort
and
that
he
wanted
to
think
they
patiently
awaited
the
results
of
his
thinking
confident
that
he
would
presently
hit
upon
precisely
the
right
thing
to
do
after
a
while
he
raised
his
head
from
his
hands
and
said
come
on
we
must
get
clear
away
from
here
before
morning
but
he
said
not
a
word
about
where
he
was
going
his
course
was
now
nearly
south
east
and
just
as
the
day
was
breaking
he
stopped
and
said
there
is
the
river
at
last
now
let
s
go
to
sleep
they
obeyed
him
unquestioningly
though
they
had
not
the
faintest
idea
where
they
were
or
what
river
it
was
which
he
had
seen
a
little
way
ahead
when
sam
waked
it
was
nearly
noon
and
he
ate
a
little
of
the
palmetto
cabbage
left
in
his
pockets
while
the
others
slept
his
face
was
very
pale
however
and
he
sat
very
still
until
his
companions
aroused
themselves
then
he
explained
fort
glass
the
question
was
where
should
we
go
fort
stoddart
is
probably
surrounded
by
indians
too
and
so
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
make
our
way
down
through
the
tensaw
country
to
mobile
but
that
is
about
eighty
or
a
hundred
miles
away
and
the
fact
is
i
am
a
little
sick
from
my
wound
my
foot
and
leg
are
all
swelled
up
and
i
ve
been
having
a
fever
so
that
i
ca
nt
travel
much
further
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
best
thing
to
do
under
the
circumstances
was
to
find
a
good
hiding
place
where
it
will
be
easy
to
get
something
to
eat
and
to
stay
there
till
i
get
better
or
something
turns
up
and
so
i
thought
of
the
alabama
river
as
the
very
best
place
because
mussels
and
things
of
that
kind
are
better
than
sweet
potatoes
and
here
we
are
now
the
next
thing
is
to
find
a
hiding
place
and
i
think
i
know
where
one
is
it
has
a
thing
for
drinking
this
swamp
and
creek
water
will
make
us
all
sick
i
was
all
through
here
on
a
camp
hunt
once
and
i
remember
a
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
two
big
hollow
trees
stand
right
together
on
top
of
a
sort
of
bluff
about
fifty
yards
further
down
the
river
there
is
a
spring
just
under
the
bluff
we
must
find
the
place
if
we
can
to
night
and
to
do
it
we
must
first
get
across
the
river
it
s
so
low
now
we
can
easily
wade
it
i
think
and
judie
can
be
pushed
across
on
a
log
as
soon
as
night
fell
the
plan
was
put
into
execution
the
river
was
extremely
low
at
the
time
and
sam
was
confident
that
by
choosing
a
wide
place
for
their
crossing
they
could
wade
the
stream
easily
but
lest
there
might
be
a
channel
too
deep
for
that
he
fastened
four
logs
together
with
grapevines
and
putting
judie
on
this
raft
bade
the
two
boys
tow
the
water
too
deep
for
wading
at
any
point
they
could
easily
support
themselves
by
clinging
to
the
logs
they
had
no
difficulty
however
and
were
soon
on
the
east
bank
of
the
stream
sam
s
task
was
a
much
harder
one
the
current
was
very
rapid
and
the
bottom
too
soft
for
the
easy
use
of
his
crutch
while
his
strength
was
almost
gone
his
spirit
sustained
him
however
and
after
a
while
he
reached
the
shore
when
all
were
landed
the
search
began
for
the
hiding
place
sam
had
described
it
proved
to
be
more
than
a
mile
higher
up
the
river
and
when
they
found
it
the
day
was
breaking
the
trees
were
not
hollow
as
sam
had
supposed
the
river
bank
in
that
place
is
in
three
terraces
and
the
two
great
trees
stood
almost
alone
on
the
second
one
of
these
the
sandy
soil
had
been
gradually
washed
out
from
under
the
great
trunks
so
that
the
trees
proper
began
about
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
of
exposed
roots
some
of
them
a
foot
or
two
in
thickness
and
others
varying
in
size
all
the
way
down
to
mere
threads
the
freshets
which
had
washed
the
earth
away
from
the
roots
had
piled
a
great
mass
of
drift
wood
against
one
side
of
them
sam
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
place
and
then
all
went
to
work
the
two
boys
so
disposed
some
of
the
drift
wood
as
to
make
a
sort
of
covered
passage
from
the
edge
of
the
bank
to
the
two
trees
whose
roots
were
interlaced
with
each
other
sam
cut
away
some
of
that
miss
minchin
did
for
after
that
simple
answer
she
had
sent
in
a
bill
for
the
expense
of
sara
s
education
and
support
and
she
made
it
quite
large
enough
and
because
mr
carrisford
thought
sara
would
wish
it
paid
it
was
paid
when
mr
carmichael
paid
it
he
had
a
brief
interview
with
miss
minchin
in
which
he
expressed
his
opinion
with
much
clearness
and
force
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
miss
minchin
did
not
enjoy
the
conversation
sara
had
been
about
a
month
with
mr
carrisford
and
had
begun
to
realize
that
her
happiness
was
not
a
dream
when
one
night
the
indian
gentleman
saw
that
she
sat
a
long
time
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
looking
at
the
fire
what
are
you
supposing
sara
he
asked
sara
looked
up
with
a
bright
color
on
her
cheeks
i
was
supposing
she
said
i
was
remembering
that
hungry
day
and
a
child
i
saw
but
there
were
a
great
many
hungry
days
said
the
indian
gentleman
with
a
rather
was
it
i
forgot
you
did
nt
know
said
sara
it
was
the
day
i
found
the
things
in
my
garret
and
then
she
told
him
the
story
of
the
bun
shop
and
the
fourpence
and
the
child
who
was
hungrier
than
herself
and
somehow
as
she
told
it
though
she
told
it
very
simply
indeed
the
indian
gentleman
found
it
necessary
to
shade
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
look
down
at
the
floor
and
i
was
supposing
a
kind
of
plan
said
sara
when
she
had
finished
i
was
thinking
i
would
like
to
do
something
what
is
it
said
her
guardian
in
a
low
tone
you
may
do
anything
you
like
to
do
princess
i
was
wondering
said
sara
you
know
you
say
i
have
a
great
deal
of
money
and
i
was
wondering
if
i
could
go
and
see
the
bun
woman
and
tell
her
that
if
when
hungry
children
particularly
on
in
at
the
window
she
would
just
call
them
in
and
give
them
something
to
eat
she
might
send
the
bills
to
me
and
i
would
pay
them
could
i
do
that
you
shall
do
it
to
morrow
morning
said
the
indian
gentleman
thank
you
said
sara
you
see
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
hungry
and
it
is
very
hard
when
one
ca
nt
even
pretend
it
away
yes

my
dear
said
the
indian
gentleman
yes
it
must
be
try
to
forget
it
come
and
sit
on
this
footstool
near
my
knee
and
only
remember
you
are
a
princess
yes
said
sara
and
i
can
give
buns
and
bread
to
the
populace
and
she
went
and
sat
on
the
stool
and
the
indian
gentleman
he
used
to
like
her
to
call
him
that
too
sometimes
in
fact
very
often
drew
her
small
dark
head
down
upon
his
carriage
drew
up
before
the
door
of
the
baker
s
shop
and
a
gentleman
and
a
little
girl
got
out
oddly
enough
just
as
the
bun
woman
was
putting
a
tray
of
smoking
hotbuns
into
the
window
when
sara
entered
the
shop
the
woman
turned
and
looked
at
her
and
leaving
the
buns
came
and
stood
behind
the
counter
for
a
moment
she
looked
at
sara
very
hard
indeed
and
then
her
good
natured
face
lighted
up
i
m
that
sure
i
remember
you
miss
she
said
and
yet
yes
said
sara
once
you
gave
me
six
buns
for
fourpence
and
and
you
gave
five
of
em
to
a
beggar
child
said
the
woman
i
ve
always
remembered
it
i
could
nt
make
it
out
at
first
i
beg
pardon
sir
but
there
s
not
many
young
people
that
notices
a
hungry
face
in
that
way
and
i
ve
thought
of
it
many
a
time
excuse
the
liberty
did
that
day
i
am
better
thank
you
said
sara
and
and
i
am
happier
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
me
miss
exclaimed
the
woman
why
bless
you
yes
miss
what
can
i
do
and
then
sara
made
her
little
proposal
and
the
woman
listened
to
it
with
an
astonished
face
why
bless
me
she
said
when
she
had
heard
it
all
yes
miss
it
ll
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
do
it
i
am
a
working
woman
myself
and
ca
nt
afford
to
do
much
on
my
own
account
and
there
s
sights
of
trouble
on
every
side
but
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
m
bound
to
say
i
ve
given
many
a
bit
of
bread
away
since
that
wet
afternoon
just
along
o
thinkin
of
you
an
how
wet
an
cold
you
was
an
away
your
hot
buns
as
if
you
was
a
princess
the
indian
gentleman
smiled
involuntarily
and
sara
smiled
a
little
too
she
looked
so
hungry
she
said
she
was
hungrier
than
i
was
she
was
starving
said
the
woman
many
s
the
time
she
s
told
me
of
it
since
how
she
sat
there
in
the
wet
and
felt
as
if
a
wolf
was
a
tearing
at
her
poor
young
insides
oh
have
you
seen
her
since
then
exclaimed
sara
do
you
know
where
she
is
i
know
said
the
woman
why
she
s
in
that
there
back
room
now
miss
an
has
been
for
a
month
an
a
decent
well
meaning
girl
she
s
going
to
turn
out
an
such
a
help
to
me
in
the
day
shop
an
in
the
kitchen
as
you
d
scarce
believe
knowing
how
she
s
lived
she
stepped
to
the
the
next
minute
a
girl
came
out
and
followed
her
behind
the
counter
and
actually
it
was
the
beggar
child
clean
and
neatly
clothed
and
looking
as
if
she
had
not
been
hungry
for
a
long
time
she
looked
shy
but
she
had
a
nice
face
now
that
she
was
no
longer
a
savage
and
the
wild
look
had
gone
from
her
eyes
and
she
knew
sara
in
an
instant
and
praiseworthy
resolutions
he
tried
the
handle
of
the
door
half
expecting
to
find
it
locked
and
himself
obliged
to
effect
an
entrance
through
the
window
but
no
it
yielded
to
his
touch
and
he
went
in
hall
and
staircase
were
intensely
dark
but
he
knew
his
way
without
a
pilot
this
time
and
steered
clear
of
all
shoals
and
quicksands
through
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
the
door
of
the
lighted
room
leoline
s
room
lay
wide
open
and
he
paused
on
the
threshold
to
reconnoitre
he
had
gone
softly
for
fear
of
startling
her
and
now
with
the
same
tender
caution
he
glanced
round
the
room
the
lamp
burned
on
the
dainty
dressing
table
where
undisturbed
lay
jewels
perfume
bottles
and
other
knickknacks
the
cithern
lay
unmolested
on
the
couch
the
rich
curtains
were
drawn
everything
was
as
he
had
left
it
last
everything
but
the
pretty
pink
figure
with
drooping
eyes
and
he
looked
round
for
the
things
she
had
worn
hoping
she
had
taken
them
off
and
retired
to
rest
but
they
were
not
to
be
seen
and
with
a
cold
sinking
of
the
heart
he
went
noiselessly
across
the
room
and
to
the
bed
it
was
empty
and
showed
no
trace
of
having
been
otherwise
since
he
and
the
pest
cart
driver
had
borne
from
it
the
apparently
lifeless
form
of
leoline
yes
she
was
gone
and
sir
norman
turned
for
a
moment
so
sick
with
utter
dread
that
he
leaned
against
one
of
the
tall
carved
posts
and
hated
himself
for
having
left
her
with
a
heartlessness
that
his
worst
enemy
could
not
have
surpassed
then
aroused
into
new
and
spasmodic
energy
by
the
exigency
of
the
case
he
seized
the
lamp
and
going
out
to
the
hall
made
the
house
ring
from
basement
to
attic
with
her
name
no
reply
but
that
hollow
melancholy
echo
that
sounds
so
lugubriously
through
empty
houses
was
returned
and
he
jumped
down
in
the
hall
below
with
a
crash
and
flying
wildly
from
room
to
room
in
solemn
grim
repose
they
lay
but
none
of
them
held
the
bright
figure
in
rose
satin
he
sought
and
he
left
them
in
despair
and
went
back
to
her
chamber
again
leoline
leoline
leoline
he
called
while
he
rushed
impetuously
ap
stairs
and
down
stairs
and
in
my
lady
s
chamber
but
leoline
answered
not
perhaps
never
would
answer
more
even
hoping
against
hope
he
had
to
give
up
the
chase
at
last
no
leoline
did
that
house
hold
and
with
this
conviction
despairingly
impressed
on
leis
mind
sir
norman
kingsley
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
uttered
a
dismal
groan
yet
forlorn
as
was
the
case
he
groaned
but
once
only
that
and
nothing
more
there
was
no
time
for
such
small
luxuries
as
groaning
and
tearing
his
hair
and
boiling
over
with
wrath
and
vengeance
against
the
human
race
generally
and
rochester
and
count
l
estrange
particularly
he
plunged
head
foremost
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
door
there
he
was
impetuously
brought
up
all
standing
for
somebody
stood
before
it
gazing
up
at
the
gloomy
front
with
as
much
earnestness
as
he
had
done
himself
and
against
this
individual
he
rushed
recklessly
with
a
shock
that
nearly
sent
the
pair
of
them
over
into
the
street
sacr
r
re
cried
a
shrill
voice
in
tones
of
indignant
remonstrance
what
do
you
mean
monsieur
are
you
drunk
or
crazy
that
you
come
running
head
foremost
into
peaceable
citizens
and
throwing
them
heels
uppermost
on
the
king
s
highway
stand
off
sir
and
think
yourself
lucky
that
i
do
nt
run
you
through
with
my
dirk
for
such
an
insult
at
the
first
sound
of
the
outraged
treble
tones
sir
norman
had
started
back
and
glared
upon
the
speaker
with
much
the
same
expression
of
countenance
as
an
incensed
tiger
the
orator
of
the
spirited
address
had
stooped
to
pick
gravity
which
was
considerably
knocked
out
of
place
by
the
unexpected
collision
and
held
forth
with
very
flashing
eyes
and
altogether
too
angry
to
recognize
his
auditor
sir
norman
waited
until
he
had
done
and
then
springing
at
him
grabbed
him
by
the
collar
you
young
hound
he
exclaimed
fairly
lifting
him
off
his
feet
with
one
hand
and
shaking
him
as
if
he
would
have
wriggled
him
out
of
hose
and
doublet
you
infernal
young
jackanapes
i
ll
run
you
through
in
less
than
two
minutes
if
you
do
nt
tell
me
where
you
have
taken
her
the
astonishment
not
to
say
consternation
of
master
hubert
for
that
small
young
gentleman
and
no
other
it
was
on
thus
having
his
ideas
thus
shaken
out
of
him
was
unbounded
and
held
him
perfectly
speechless
while
sir
norman
glared
at
him
and
shook
him
in
a
way
that
would
have
instantaneously
killed
him
if
his
looks
were
lightning
the
boy
had
recognized
his
aggressor
and
after
to
free
himself
and
at
last
succeeded
by
an
artful
spring
sir
norman
kingsley
he
cried
keeping
a
safe
yard
or
two
of
pavement
between
him
and
that
infuriated
young
knight
have
you
gone
mad
or
what
is
heaven
s
name
is
the
moaning
of
all
this
it
means
exclaimed
sir
norman
drawing
his
sword
and
flourishing
it
within
an
inch
of
the
boy
s
curly
head
that
you
ll
be
a
dead
page
in
lees
than
half
a
minute
unless
you
tell
me
immediately
where
she
has
been
taken
to
where
who
has
been
taken
to
inquired
hubert
opening
his
bright
and
indignant
black
eyes
in
a
way
that
reminded
sir
norman
forcibly
of
leoline
pardon
monsieur
i
do
nt
understand
at
all
you
young
villain
do
you
mean
to
stand
up
there
and
tell
me
to
my
face
that
you
have
not
searched
for
her
and
found
her
and
have
carried
her
lady
we
were
talking
of
that
was
saved
from
the
river
asked
hubert
a
new
light
dawning
upon
him
do
i
mean
the
lady
we
were
talking
of

to
the
theater
with
me
looking
up

was
surprised
to

chapter
xxviii
harold
s
temptation
mrs
merton
was
rather
astonished
when
her
grand
nephew
harold
walked
into
her
room
one
day
and
inquired
for
her
health
she
had
been
absent
from
the
dinner
table
on
account
of
a
headache
thank
you
harold
she
said
i
am
feeling
a
little
better
have
you
any
errand
you
would
like
to
have
me
do
for
you
mrs
merton
was
still
more
surprised
for
offers
of
services
were
rare
with
harold
thank
you
again
she
said
but
luke
was
here
this
morning
and
i
gave
him
two
or
three
commissions
perhaps
you
would
like
me
thank
you
but
i
am
a
little
afraid
it
would
nt
be
a
good
thing
for
my
head
how
are
you
getting
on
at
school
harold
pretty
well
you
do
nt
want
to
go
to
college
no
i
think
i
would
rather
be
a
business
man
well
you
know
your
own
tastes
best
aunt
eliza
said
harold
after
a
pause
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
speak
out
harold
wo
nt
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
ten
dollars
ten
dollars
repeated
the
old
lady
eying
harold
closely
why
do
you
want
ten
dollars
you
see
mother
keeps
me
very
close
all
the
fellows
have
more
money
to
spend
than
i
how
much
does
your
mother
give
you
as
an
allowance
two
dollars
a
week
it
seems
to
me
that
is
liberal
considering
that
clothes
a
boy
in
my
position
is
expected
to
spend
money
who
expects
it
why
everybody
by
the
way
what
is
your
position
asked
the
old
lady
pointedly
why
said
harold
uneasily
i
am
supposed
to
be
rich
as
i
live
in
a
nice
neighborhood
on
a
fashionable
street
that
does
nt
make
you
rich
does
it
no
answered
harold
with
hesitation
you
do
nt
feel
absolutely
obliged
to
spend
more
than
your
allowance
do
you
well
you
see
the
fellows
think
i
am
mean
if
i
do
nt
there
s
ben
clark
has
an
allowance
of
five
dollars
a
week
and
he
is
three
months
younger
than
i
am
then
i
think
his
parents
or
guardians
are
very
unwise
how
does
he
spend
his
liberal
allowance
oh
he
has
a
good
time
i
am
would
approve
luke
has
more
money
than
i
have
and
he
is
only
a
newsboy
grumbled
harold
how
do
you
know
i
notice
he
always
has
money
i
doubt
whether
he
spends
half
a
dollar
a
week
on
his
own
amusement
he
has
a
mother
and
young
brother
to
support
he
says
so
so
you
doubt
it
it
may
be
true
if
you
find
it
is
nt
true
you
can
let
me
know
i
am
sorry
that
you
think
so
much
more
of
luke
than
of
me
complained
harold
how
do
you
know
i
do
mother
thinks
so
as
well
as
i
suppose
we
leave
luke
out
of
consideration
i
shall
think
as
much
of
you
as
you
deserve
harold
rose
from
his
seat
as
you
have
no
errand
for
me
aunt
eliza
i
will
go
he
said
mrs
merton
unlocked
a
and
extracted
therefrom
a
ten
dollar
bill
you
have
asked
me
a
favor
and
i
will
grant
it
for
once
she
said
here
are
ten
dollars
thank
you
said
harold
joyfully
i
wo
nt
even
ask
how
you
propose
to
spend
it
i
thought
of
doing
so
but
it
would
imply
distrust
and
for
this
occasion
i
wo
nt
show
any
you
are
very
kind
aunt
eliza
i
am
glad
you
think
so
you
are
welcome
to
the
money
harold
left
the
room
in
high
spirits
he
decided
not
to
let
his
mother
know
that
he
had
received
so
large
a
sum
as
she
might
inquire
to
what
use
he
intended
to
put
it
and
some
of
his
expenditures
he
felt
pretty
sure
would
not
be
approved
by
her
he
left
the
house
and
going
downtown
joined
a
couple
of
friends
of
his
own
stamp
they
adjourned
to
a
billiard
saloon
and
between
harold
managed
to
spend
three
dollars
before
suppertime
three
days
later
the
entire
sum
given
him
by
his
aunt
was
gone
when
harold
made
the
discovery
he
sighed
his
dream
was
over
it
had
been
pleasant
as
long
as
it
lasted
but
it
was
over
too
soon
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
mean
allowance
he
said
to
himself
in
a
discontented
tone
aunt
eliza
might
give
me
ten
dollars
every
week
just
as
well
as
not
she
is
positively
rolling
in
wealth
while
i
have
to
grub
along
like
a
newsboy
why
that
fellow
luke
has
a
great
deal
more
money
than
i
a
little
conversation
which
he
had
with
his
uncle
warner
made
his
discontent
more
intense
hello
harold
what
makes
you
look
so
blue
he
asked
one
day
because
i
have
nt
got
any
money
answered
harold
does
nt
your
mother
or
aunt
eliza
give
you
any
i
get
a
little
but
it
how
much
two
dollars
a
week
it
is
more
than
i
had
when
i
was
of
your
age
that
does
nt
make
it
any
better
aunt
eliza
is
nt
exactly
lavish
still
she
pays
luke
walton
generously
do
you
know
how
much
he
gets
a
week
asked
harold
eagerly
ten
dollars
ten
dollars
ejaculated
harold
you
do
nt
really
mean
it
yes
i
do
i
saw
her
pay
him
that
sum
yesterday
i
asked
her
if
it
was
nt
liberal
she
admitted
it
but
said
he
had
a
mother
and
brother
to
support
it
s
a
shame
cried
harold
passionately
why
is
it
the
money
is
her
own
is
nt
it
she
ought
not
to
treat
a
stranger
better
than
her
own
nephew
that
means
me
i
judge
said
warner
smiling
about
it
is
there
no
i
do
nt
know
as
there
is
replied
harold
slowly
but
he
thought
over
what
his
uncle
had
told
him
and
it
made
him
very
s
visage
and
even
if
the
great
stone
face
had
assumed
his
look
of
stern
command
the
milder
traits
would
man
of
prophecy
sighed
ernest
to
himself
as
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
throng
and
must
the
world
wait
longer
yet
the
mists
had
congregated
about
the
distant
mountainside
and
there
were
seen
the
grand
and
awful
features
of
the
great
stone
face
awful
but
benignant
as
if
a
mighty
angel
were
sitting
among
the
hills
and
enrobing
himself
in
a
cloud
vesture
of
gold
and
purple
as
he
looked
ernest
could
hardly
believe
but
that
a
smile
beamed
over
the
whole
visage
with
a
radiance
still
brightening
although
without
motion
of
the
lips
it
was
probably
the
effect
of
the
western
sunshine
melting
through
the
thinly
diffused
vapors
that
had
swept
between
him
and
the
object
that
he
gazed
at
but
as
it
always
did
the
aspect
of
his
marvellous
friend
made
ernest
as
hopeful
as
if
he
had
never
hoped
in
vain
fear
not
ernest
said
his
heart
even
as
if
the
great
face
were
whispering
him
fear
not
swiftly
and
tranquilly
away
ernest
still
dwelt
in
his
native
valley
and
was
now
a
man
of
middle
age
by
imperceptible
degrees
he
had
become
known
among
the
people
now
as
heretofore
he
labored
for
his
bread
and
was
the
same
simple
hearted
man
that
he
had
always
been
but
he
had
thought
and
felt
so
much
he
had
given
so
many
of
the
best
hours
of
his
life
to
unworldly
hopes
for
some
great
good
to
mankind
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
been
talking
with
the
angels
and
had
imbibed
a
portion
of
their
wisdom
unawares
it
was
visible
in
the
calm
and
well
considered
beneficence
of
his
daily
life
the
quiet
stream
of
which
had
made
a
wide
green
margin
all
along
its
course
not
a
day
passed
by
that
the
world
was
not
the
better
because
this
man
humble
as
he
was
had
lived
he
never
stepped
aside
from
his
own
path
yet
would
always
reach
a
blessing
to
his
neighbor
almost
involuntarily
too
he
of
his
thought
which
as
one
of
its
manifestations
took
shape
in
the
good
deeds
that
dropped
silently
from
his
hand
flowed
also
forth
in
speech
he
uttered
truths
that
wrought
upon
and
moulded
the
lives
of
those
who
heard
him
his
auditors
it
may
be
never
suspected
that
ernest
their
own
neighbor
and
familiar
friend
was
more
than
an
ordinary
man
least
of
all
did
ernest
himself
suspect
it
but
inevitably
as
the
murmur
of
a
rivulet
came
thoughts
out
of
his
mouth
that
no
other
human
lips
had
spoken
when
the
people
s
minds
had
had
a
little
time
to
cool
they
were
ready
enough
to
acknowledge
their
mistake
in
imagining
a
similarity
between
general
blood
and
thunder
s
truculent
physiognomy
and
the
benign
visage
on
the
mountain
side
but
now
again
there
were
reports
and
many
paragraphs
in
the
newspapers
affirming
that
the
likeness
of
the
great
stone
face
had
appeared
upon
the
broad
shoulders
of
a
certain
eminent
statesman
he
like
mr
gathergold
and
old
blood
and
thunder
was
in
his
early
days
and
taken
up
the
trades
of
law
and
politics
instead
of
the
rich
man
s
wealth
and
the
warrior
s
sword
he
had
but
a
tongue
and
it
was
mightier
than
both
together
so
wonderfully
eloquent
was
he
that
whatever
he
might
choose
to
say
his
auditors
had
no
choice
but
to
believe
him
wrong
looked
like
right
and
right
like
wrong
for
when
it
pleased
him
he
could
make
a
kind
of
illuminated
fog
with
his
mere
breath
and
obscure
the
natural
daylight
with
it
his
tongue
indeed
was
a
magic
instrument
sometimes
it
rumbled
like
the
thunder
sometimes
it
warbled
like
the
sweetest
music
it
was
the
blast
of
war
the
song
of
peace
and
it
seemed
to
have
a
heart
in
it
when
there
was
no
such
matter
in
good
truth
he
was
a
wondrous
man
and
when
his
tongue
had
acquired
him
all
other
imaginable
success
when
it
had
been
heard
in
halls
of
state
and
in
made
him
known
all
over
the
world
even
as
a
voice
crying
from
shore
to
shore
it
finally
persuaded
his
countrymen
to
select
him
for
the
presidency
before
this
time
indeed
as
soon
as
he
began
to
grow
celebrated
his
admirers
had
found
out
the
resemblance
between
him
and
the
great
stone
face
and
so
much
were
they
struck
by
it
that
throughout
the
country
this
distinguished
gentleman
was
known
by
the
name
of
old
stony
phiz
the
phrase
was
considered
as
giving
a
highly
favorable
aspect
to
his
political
prospects
for
as
is
likewise
the
case
with
the
popedom
nobody
ever
becomes
president
without
taking
a
name
other
than
his
own
while
his
friends
were
doing
their
best
to
make
him
president
old
stony
phiz
as
he
was
called
set
out
on
a
visit
to
the
valley
where
he
was
born
of
course
he
had
no
other
object
than
to
shake
hands
with
his
fellow
citizens
and
neither
thought
nor
cared
about
any
effect
which
his
progress
through
the
country
might
have
the
illustrious
statesman
a
cavalcade
of
horsemen
set
forth
to
meet
him
at
the
boundary
line
of
the
state
and
all
the
people
left
their
business
and
gathered
along
the
wayside
to
see
him
pass
among
these
was
ernest
though
more
than
once
disappointed
as
we
have
seen
he
had
such
a
hopeful
and
confiding
nature
that
he
was
always
ready
to
believe
in
whatever
seemed
beautiful
and
good
he
kept
his
heart
continually
open
and
thus
was
sure
to
catch
the
blessing
from
on
high
when
it
should
come
so
now
again
as
buoyantly
as
ever
he
went
forth
to
behold
the
likeness
of
the
great
stone
face
the
cavalcade
came
prancing
along
the
road
with
a
great
clattering
of
hoofs
and
a
mighty
cloud
of
dust
which
rose
up
so
dense
and
high
that
ruth
answered
a
sweet
bird
like
voice
which
pierced
poor
rex
s
heart
to
the
very
core
as
a
girlish
little
figure
bounded
through
the
open
door
way
out
into
the
brilliant
sunshine
god
pity
me
cried
rex
staggering
forward
it
is
daisy
my
wife
chapter
xiii
rex
had
hoped
against
hope
daisy
he
cried
holding
out
his
arms
to
her
with
a
yearning
passionate
cry
my
god
tell
me
it
is
false
you
are
not
here
with
stanwick
or
i
shall
go
mad
daisy
my
dear
little
sweetheart
my
little
love
why
do
nt
you
speak
he
cried
clasping
her
close
to
his
heart
rapturous
kisses
daisy
struggled
out
of
his
embrace
with
a
low
broken
sob
flinging
herself
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
with
a
sharp
cry
daisy
said
the
old
lady
bending
over
her
and
smoothing
back
the
golden
hair
from
the
lovely
anguished
face
tell
him
the
truth
dear
you
are
here
with
mr
stanwick
is
it
not
so
the
sudden
weight
of
sorrow
that
had
fallen
upon
poor
hapless
daisy
seemed
to
paralyze
her
very
senses
the
sunshine
seemed
blotted
out
and
the
light
of
heaven
to
grow
dark
around
her
yes
she
cried
despairingly
and
it
almost
seemed
to
daisy
another
voice
had
spoken
with
her
lips
this
mr
stanwick
claims
to
be
your
husband
asked
the
old
lady
solemnly
yes
she
cried
out
again
in
agony
but
rex
i
i
the
words
died
away
on
her
white
lips
and
the
sound
died
away
in
a
look
of
white
frozen
horror
on
his
face
which
gave
place
to
stern
bitter
wrath
slowly
and
sadly
he
put
her
clinging
arms
away
from
him
folding
his
arms
across
his
breast
with
that
terrible
look
upon
his
face
such
as
a
hero
s
face
wears
when
he
has
heard
unflinchingly
his
death
sentence
the
calm
of
terrible
despair
daisy
he
said
proudly
i
have
trusted
you
blindly
for
i
loved
you
madly
passionately
i
would
as
soon
believe
the
fair
smiling
heavens
that
bend
above
us
false
as
you
whom
i
loved
so
madly
and
so
well
i
was
mad
to
bind
you
with
such
cruel
irksome
bonds
when
your
heart
was
not
mine
but
another
s
my
dream
of
love
is
shattered
now
you
have
broken
my
heart
and
ruined
and
blighted
my
life
god
forgive
you
daisy
for
i
never
can
i
give
you
back
your
freedom
i
release
you
from
your
vows
i
can
not
curse
you
i
you
from
my
heart
as
i
cast
you
from
my
life
farewell
daisy
farewell
forever
she
tried
to
speak
but
her
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
oh
pitying
heaven
if
she
could
only
have
cried
out
to
you
and
the
angels
to
bear
witness
and
proclaim
her
innocence
the
strength
to
move
hand
or
foot
seemed
suddenly
to
have
left
her
she
tried
hard
oh
so
hard
to
speak
but
no
sound
issued
from
her
white
lips
she
felt
as
one
in
a
horrible
trance
fearfully
terribly
conscious
of
all
that
transpired
around
her
yet
denied
the
power
to
move
even
a
muscle
to
defend
herself
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
daisy
he
asked
mournfully
turning
from
her
to
depart
the
woful
terrified
gaze
of
the
blue
eyes
deepened
pitifully
but
she
spoke
no
word
and
rex
turned
from
her
turned
from
the
girl
bride
whom
he
loved
so
madly
with
a
bursting
broken
left
her
alone
with
the
pitying
sunlight
falling
upon
her
golden
hair
and
her
white
face
turned
up
to
heaven
silently
praying
to
god
that
she
might
die
then
and
there
oh
father
above
pity
her
she
had
no
mother
s
gentle
voice
to
guide
her
no
father
s
strong
breast
to
weep
upon
no
sister
s
soothing
presence
she
was
so
young
and
so
pitifully
lonely
and
rex
had
drifted
out
of
her
life
forever
believing
her
oh
bitterest
of
thoughts
believing
her
false
and
sinful
poor
little
daisy
was
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
the
world
but
a
dim
realization
of
the
full
import
of
the
terrible
accusation
brought
against
her
forced
its
way
to
her
troubled
brain
she
only
realized
rex
her
darling
rex
had
gone
out
of
her
life
forever
daisy
flung
herself
face
downward
in
the
long
cool
waving
green
grass
where
rex
had
left
her
daisy
called
miss
burton
softly
it
is
all
over
but
she
turned
from
her
with
a
shuddering
gasp
in
the
name
of
pity
leave
me
to
myself
she
sobbed
it
is
the
greatest
kindness
you
can
do
me
and
the
poor
old
lady
who
had
wrought
so
much
sorrow
unwittingly
in
those
two
severed
lives
walked
slowly
back
to
the
cottage
with
tears
in
her
eyes
strongly
impressed
there
must
be
some
dark
mystery
in
the
young
girl
s
life
who
was
sobbing
her
heart
out
in
the
green
grass
yonder
and
she
did
just
what
almost
any
other
person
would
have
done
under
the
same
circumstances
sent
immediately
for
lester
stanwick
he
answered
the
summons
at
once
listening
with
intense
interest
while
the
aged
spinster
briefly
related
all
that
had
transpired
but
through
oversight
or
excitement
she
quite
forgot
to
mention
rex
had
called
daisy
his
wife
curse
him
he
muttered
under
his
breath
i
i
believe
the
girl
actually
cares
for
him
then
he
went
out
to
daisy
lying
so
poor
daisy
poor
desperate
lonely
struggling
child
all
this
cruel
load
of
sorrow
crushing
her
girlish
heart
and
blighting
her
young
life
and
she
so
innocent
so
entirely
blameless
yet
such
a
plaything
of
fate
daisy
he
said
bending
over
her
and
lifting
the
slight
form
in
his
arms
they
tell
me
some
one
has
been
troubling
you
who
has
dared
annoy
you
trust
in
me
daisy
what
is
the
matter
lester
stanwick
never
forgot
the
white
pitiful
face
that
was
raised
to
his
i
want
to
die
she
sobbed
oh
why
did
you
not
leave
me
to
die
in
the
dark
water
wanted
in
it
he
said
he
must
try
her
some
time
in
made
mela
repeat
them
could
only
mean
that
he
admired
her
more
than
anybody
else
he
came
fitfully
but
he
came
often
and
she
rested
content
in
a
girl
s
indefiniteness
concerning
the
affair
if
her
thought
went
beyond
lovemaking
to
marriage
she
believed
that
she
could
have
him
if
she
wanted
him
her
father
s
money
counted
in
this
she
divined
that
beaton
was
poor
but
that
made
no
difference
she
would
have
enough
for
both
the
money
would
have
counted
as
an
irresistible
attraction
if
there
had
been
no
other
the
affair
had
gone
on
in
spite
of
the
sidelong
looks
of
restless
dislike
with
which
dryfoos
regarded
it
but
now
when
beaton
did
not
come
to
saratoga
it
necessarily
dropped
and
christine
s
content
with
it
she
bore
the
trial
as
long
as
she
could
she
used
pride
and
resentment
against
it
but
at
last
she
could
not
bear
it
and
with
mela
s
help
she
wrote
a
letter
bantering
beaton
on
his
stay
in
new
york
and
that
it
was
a
very
bright
letter
and
would
be
sure
to
bring
him
they
would
have
had
no
scruple
about
sending
it
but
for
the
doubt
they
had
whether
they
had
got
some
of
the
words
right
mela
offered
to
bet
christine
anything
she
dared
that
they
were
right
and
she
said
send
it
anyway
it
was
no
difference
if
they
were
wrong
but
christine
could
not
endure
to
think
of
that
laugh
of
beaton
s
and
there
remained
only
mrs
mandel
as
authority
on
the
spelling
christine
dreaded
her
authority
on
other
points
but
mela
said
she
knew
she
would
not
interfere
and
she
undertook
to
get
round
her
mrs
mandel
pronounced
the
spelling
bad
and
the
taste
worse
she
forbade
them
to
send
the
letter
and
mela
failed
to
get
round
her
though
she
threatened
if
mrs
mandel
would
not
tell
her
how
to
spell
the
wrong
words
that
she
would
send
the
letter
as
it
was
then
mrs
mandel
said
that
if
mr
beaton
appeared
in
saratoga
she
this
result
christine
accused
her
of
having
mismanaged
the
whole
business
she
quarrelled
with
her
and
they
called
each
other
names
christine
declared
that
she
would
not
stay
in
saratoga
and
that
if
mrs
mandel
did
not
go
back
to
new
york
with
her
she
should
go
alone
they
returned
the
first
week
in
september
but
by
that
time
beaton
had
gone
to
see
his
people
in
syracuse
conrad
dryfoos
remained
at
home
with
his
mother
after
his
father
went
west
he
had
already
taken
such
a
vacation
as
he
had
been
willing
to
allow
himself
and
had
spent
it
on
a
charity
farm
near
the
city
where
the
fathers
with
whom
he
worked
among
the
poor
on
the
east
side
in
the
winter
had
sent
some
of
their
wards
for
the
summer
it
was
not
possible
to
keep
his
recreation
a
secret
at
the
office
and
fulkerson
found
a
pleasure
in
figuring
the
jolly
time
brother
conrad
must
have
teaching
farm
work
among
those
paupers
and
potential
reprobates
he
invented
details
of
his
experience
among
them
laugh
at
conrad
s
humorless
helplessness
under
fulkerson
s
burlesque
denunciation
of
a
summer
outing
spent
in
such
dissipation
they
had
time
for
a
great
deal
of
joking
at
the
office
during
the
season
of
leisure
which
penetrates
in
august
to
the
very
heart
of
business
and
they
all
got
on
terms
of
greater
intimacy
if
not
greater
friendliness
than
before
fulkerson
had
not
had
so
long
to
do
with
the
advertising
side
of
human
nature
without
developing
a
vein
of
cynicism
of
no
great
depth
perhaps
but
broad
and
underlying
his
whole
point
of
view
he
made
light
of
beaton
s
solemnity
as
he
made
light
of
conrad
s
humanity
the
art
editor
with
abundant
sarcasm
had
no
more
humor
than
the
publisher
and
was
an
easy
prey
in
the
manager
s
hands
but
when
he
had
been
led
on
by
fulkerson
s
flatteries
to
make
some
betrayal
of
egotism
he
brooded
over
it
till
he
had
thought
how
to
revenge
himself
in
elaborate
insult
for
beaton
s
talent
fulkerson
never
lost
his
admiration
himself
airs
of
being
the
sole
source
of
the
magazine
s
prosperity
no
bait
of
this
sort
was
too
obvious
for
beaton
to
swallow
he
could
be
caught
with
it
as
often
as
fulkerson
chose
though
he
was
ordinarily
suspicious
as
to
the
motives
of
people
in
saying
things
with
march
he
got
on
no
better
than
at
first
he
seemed
to
be
lying
in
wait
for
some
encroachment
of
the
literary
department
on
the
art
department
and
he
met
it
now
and
then
with
anticipative
reprisal
after
these
rebuffs
the
editor
delivered
him
over
to
the
manager
who
could
turn
beaton
s
contrary
mindedness
to
account
by
asking
the
reverse
of
what
he
really
wanted
done
this
was
what
fulkerson
said
the
fact
was
that
he
did
get
on
with
beaton
and
march
contented
himself
with
musing
upon
the
contradictions
of
a
character
at
once
so
vain
and
so
offensive
so
fickle
and
so
sullen
so
conscious
and
so
simple
after
the
first
jarring
contact
with
dryfoos
the
editor
ceased
to
feel
the
disagreeable
fact
of
none
of
the
chances
which
might
have
made
it
painful
occurred
the
control
of
the
whole
affair
remained
in
fulkerson
s
hands
before
he
went
west
again
dryfoos
had
ceased
to
come
about
the
office
as
if
having
once
worn
off
the
novelty
of
the
sense
of
owning
a
literary
periodical
he
was
no
longer
interested
in
it
yet
it
was
a
relief
somehow
when
he
left
town
which
he
did
not
do
without
coming
to
take
a
formal
leave
of
the
editor
at
his
office
he
seemed
willing
to
leave
march
with
a
better
impression
than
he
had
hitherto
troubled
himself
to
make
he
even
said
some
civil
things
about
the
magazine
as
if
its
in
a
way
ah
well
you
have
your
girlish
dreams
of
love
and
it
is
right
that
you
should
have
them
and
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
destroy
them
but
they
shall
not
be
destroyed
by
me
and
surely
not
by
any
other
man
while
i
live
i
shall
grow
young
again
i
will
grow
young
for
you
for
in
years
at
least
i
am
not
vjera
and
i
will
love
as
boys
love
but
with
the
strength
of
a
man
who
has
known
sorrow
and
overlived
it
you
shall
not
feel
that
in
taking
me
you
are
taking
a
father
a
protector
a
man
to
whom
your
youth
seems
childhood
and
your
youthfulness
childish
folly
no
no
i
will
be
more
than
that
to
you
i
will
be
all
to
you
that
you
are
to
me
and
more
and
more
each
day
till
love
has
made
us
of
one
age
of
one
mind
of
one
heart
do
you
not
believe
that
all
this
shall
be
speak
dear
what
is
there
yet
behind
in
your
thoughts
i
can
not
tell
i
wish
i
knew
vjera
s
answer
was
scarcely
audible
and
she
turned
her
face
from
him
and
yet
there
is
something
you
are
keeping
something
from
me
when
i
have
kept
nothing
from
you
why
is
it
why
do
you
not
quite
trust
me
and
now
yesterday
it
was
different
and
so
it
was
in
all
the
yesterdays
of
yesterdays
i
had
nothing
to
offer
you
but
myself
it
were
best
so
said
vjera
in
a
low
voice
the
count
was
silent
there
was
something
in
her
manner
which
he
could
not
understand
or
rather
as
he
fancied
there
was
something
in
his
own
brain
which
prevented
him
from
understanding
a
very
simple
matter
and
he
grew
impatient
with
himself
at
the
same
time
he
felt
more
and
more
strongly
drawn
to
the
young
girl
at
his
side
as
the
sun
went
down
and
the
evening
shadows
deepened
he
saw
more
in
her
face
than
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
there
every
line
of
the
pale
features
so
familiar
to
his
sight
in
his
everyday
life
reminded
him
of
moments
in
the
recent
past
when
he
had
been
wretchedly
unhappy
and
when
the
kindly
look
in
vjera
s
face
had
comforted
him
and
made
life
seem
less
unbearable
in
his
dreary
world
she
alone
had
were
insulted
or
respected
were
treated
like
a
dog
or
like
a
christian
man
the
kindness
of
his
employer
was
indeed
undeniable
but
it
was
of
the
sort
which
grated
upon
the
sensitive
nature
of
the
unfortunate
cigarette
maker
for
it
was
in
itself
vulgarly
cheerful
assuming
that
after
all
the
count
should
be
contented
with
his
lot
but
vjera
had
always
seemed
to
understand
him
to
feel
for
him
to
foresee
his
sensibilities
as
it
were
and
to
be
prepared
for
them
in
a
measure
appreciable
to
himself
she
admired
him
and
admiration
alone
can
make
pity
palatable
to
the
proud
in
her
eyes
his
constancy
under
misfortune
was
as
admirable
as
his
misfortunes
themselves
were
worthy
of
commiseration
in
her
eyes
he
was
a
gentleman
and
one
who
had
a
right
to
hold
his
head
high
among
the
best
when
he
was
poorest
he
had
felt
himself
to
be
in
her
eyes
a
hero
are
there
many
men
who
can
resist
the
charm
of
the
one
woman
who
believes
them
to
really
better
for
the
trust
and
faith
that
is
placed
in
them
by
others
as
the
earthen
vessel
valueless
in
itself
becomes
a
thing
of
prize
and
beauty
under
the
loving
hand
of
the
artist
who
draws
graceful
figures
upon
it
and
colours
it
skilfully
and
handles
it
tenderly
and
now
the
poor
man
was
puzzled
and
made
anxious
by
the
girl
s
obstinate
rejection
of
his
offer
a
chilly
thought
took
shape
in
his
mind
and
pained
him
exceedingly
vjera
he
said
at
last
i
see
how
it
is
you
have
never
loved
me
you
have
only
pitied
me
you
are
good
and
kind
vjera
but
i
wish
it
had
been
otherwise
he
spoke
very
quietly
in
a
subdued
tone
and
the
moisture
which
had
been
more
than
once
in
his
eyes
since
he
had
sat
down
beside
the
young
girl
now
almost
took
the
shape
of
a
tear
he
was
wounded
in
his
innocent
vanity
in
the
last
stronghold
of
his
fast
fading
individuality
but
illuminated
her
pale
blue
eyes
and
dispelled
the
misty
veil
that
seemed
to
dull
them
whatever
you
say
do
not
say
that
she
exclaimed
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
i
ah
if
you
only
understood
if
you
only
knew
if
you
only
guessed
that
is
it
answered
the
count
if
i
only
could
but
there
is
something
that
passes
my
understanding
the
look
of
pain
faded
from
his
face
and
gave
way
to
a
bright
smile
so
bright
so
rare
that
it
restored
in
the
magic
of
an
instant
the
freshness
of
early
youth
to
the
weary
mask
of
sorrow
then
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
as
though
searching
his
memory
for
something
he
could
not
find
what
is
it
he
asked
after
a
short
pause
and
looking
suddenly
at
vjera
it
is
something
i
ought
to
remember
and
yet
something
i
have
quite
forgotten
help
me
vjera
tell
me
what
you
are
thinking
of
and
thinking
of
this
day
a
week
ago
said
vjera
and
a
little
sob
escaped
her
as
she
quickly
looked
away
a
week
ago
let
me
see
what
happened
a
week
ago
but
why
should
i
ask
nothing
ever
happens
to
me
nothing
until
now
and
now
oh
vjera
it
is
you
who
do
not
understand
it
is
you
who
do
not
know
who
can
not
guess
as
if
he
had
forgotten
everything
else
in
the
sudden
realisation
of
his
return
to
liberty
and
fortune
he
began
to
speak
quickly
and
excitedly
in
a
tone
louder
and
clearer
than
that
of
his
ordinary
the
center
on
either
side
two
parties
are
then
formed
and
each
chooses
is
then
thrown
up
half
way
between
the
bounds
and
the
game
begins
the
contestants
contending
with
their
bats
for
the
ball
as
it
falls
when
one
succeeds
in
getting
it
fairly
into
the
pocket
of
his
bat
he
swings
it
aloft
and
throws
it
as
far
as
he
can
toward
the
bound
to
which
his
party
is
working
taking
care
to
send
it
if
possible
where
some
of
his
own
side
will
take
it
up
thus
the
ball
is
thrown
and
contended
for
till
one
party
succeeds
in
casting
it
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
opposite
party
a
hundred
players
on
a
side
are
sometimes
engaged
in
this
exciting
game

often

not

horses

sometimes

praising
their

a

and

man
untutored
savage
that
he
was
and
the
peer
in
natural
ability
of

ablest
white
men
in
the
northwest
in
his
time
he
had
largely
adopted
the
dress
and
habits
of
civilized
man
and
he
urged
his
people
to
abandon
their
savage
ways
build
houses
cultivate
fields
and
learn
to
live
like
the
white
people
he
clearly
forsaw
the
ultimate
extinction
of
his
people
as
a
distinct
race
he
well
knew
and
realized
the
numbers
and
power
of
the
whites
then
rapidly
taking
possession
of
the
hunting
grounds
of
the
dakotas
and
the
folly
of
armed
opposition
on
the
part
of
his
people
he
said
to
me
once
no
it
in
a
gory
way
as
the
south
sea
islanders
treated
their
foes
his
should
be
treated
he
would
go
upon
the
war
path
and
as
for
alf
well
he
was
sorry
for
dead
within
his
breast
specifically
he
remembered
something
in
the
reader
die
spawn
of
our
kindred
die
traitor
to
lara
as
he
spake
there
was
blood
on
the
spear
of
mudara
there
must
be
blood
and
he
laid
his
plans
with
what
he
considered
the
very
height
of
savage
craft
and
ingenuity
the
father
of
alf
was
a
sturdy
man
and
good
one
but
he
had
a
weakness
he
was
the
chief
supporter
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
itinerant
minister
who
exhorted
throughout
this
portion
of
the
country
and
he
had
imbibed
perhaps
too
much
of
a
fancy
for
hearing
himself
talk
at
revival
meetings
and
for
hearing
himself
in
long
prayers
at
home
his
petitions
covered
a
great
range
of
subjects
and
he
was
regular
in
their
presentation
the
family
prayers
before
breakfast
every
morning
were
serious
matters
to
the
boys
from
one
point
of
view
and
not
as
serious
as
they
should
have
been
from
another
present
and
kneeling
at
chairs
about
the
the
order
was
imperative
and
the
father
s
arm
was
strong
and
above
the
door
hung
a
strap
of
no
light
weight
constituting
as
it
had
once
done
that
portion
of
a
horse
s
harness
known
technically
as
the
bellyband
so
the
boys
were
always
there
each
at
his
particular
chair
and
grant
harlson
who
had
been
present
at
these
orisons
many
a
time
knew
exactly
where
alf
s
chair
was
and
the
attitude
he
must
occupy
it
was
close
beside
an
open
window
and
his
back
was
always
toward
the
opening
this
particular
attitude
having
been
dictated
by
the
father
in
the
vain
hope
of
making
his
buoyant
offspring
more
attentive
if
their
gaze
were
diverted
from
things
outside
and
all
these
circumstances
the
dreadful
savage
from
the
south
sea
islands
was
considering
with
care
they
are
very
regular
in
their
habits
in
the
country
and
he
knew
just
the
moment
when
the
morning
devotions
would
begin
some
fifteen
minutes
before
the
breakfast
hour
he
knew
about
how
long
he
would
be
in
traversing
the
coming
tragedy
and
the
morning
after
his
resolve
was
made
he
bolted
his
own
breakfast
in
a
hurry
seized
his
spear
and
scurried
down
the
wood
road
until
he
approached
the
verge
of
the
maitland
clearing
then
began
a
series
of
extraordinary
movements
mr
maitland
s
house
stood
close
by
the
wood
at
one
side
of
the
clearing
and
grant
could
easily
have
walked
unperceived
until
within
a
few
yards
of
the
place
had
he
but
kept
hidden
by
the
trees
but
such
was
not
his
course
right
across
the
clearing
and
passing
near
the
house
had
been
dug
a
great
ditch
a
yard
in
depth
a
year
or
two
before
with
the
intent
of
draining
a
piece
of
lowland
lately
subjugated
this
ditch
had
been
overgrown
with
weeds
until
it
was
almost
hidden
from
sight
and
now
in
summer
time
its
bottom
was
but
a
sandy
surface
it
was
with
the
aid
of
this
natural
shelter
that
the
wily
invader
proposed
to
steal
upon
his
enemy
already
he
was
lurking
near
its
entrance
this
particular
juncture
grant
could
not
probably
have
told
there
was
not
the
slightest
necessity
for
lurking
there
were
no
windows
in
the
side
of
the
house
toward
him
and
no
one
was
visible
about
the
place
but
he
knew
what
he
had
read
and
he
knew
that
the
savages
of
the
south
sea
islands
were
always
addicted
to
lurking
just
previous
to
springing
upon
their
unsuspecting
victims
and
he
was
bound
to
lurk
and
do
it
thoroughly
his
manner
of
lurking
consisted
before
he
reached
the
clearing
fence
in
crouching
very
low
and
creeping
along
in
a
most
constrained
and
uncomfortable
manner
occasionally
dropping
to
the
ground
slowly
and
with
utter
noiselessness
and
rising
again
with
equal
caution
all
this
time
the
face
of
the
young
man
wore
what
he
conceived
to
be
an
expression
of
most
bloody
purpose
craftily
concealed
upon
reaching
the
fence
he
shot
his
head
above
it
and
withdrew
it
with
lightning
like
rapidity
frightening
almost
into
convulsions
in
her
nest
a
robin
whose
home
was
between
the
rails
in
through
the
fence
with
greater
ease
but
that
would
have
involved
no
such
dramatic
effect
his
sudden
view
of
the
landscape
taken
the
boy
climbed
the
fence
ran
to
the
dry
ditch
parted
the
overhanging
weeds
and
leaped
down
once
in
the
dry
waterway
he
was
utterly
concealed
from
view
even
had
any
one
been
near
but
that
made
no
difference
with
his
precautions
he
knew
that
after
savages
had
lurked
they
always
glided
and
that
what
the
writers
describe
as
a
snake
like
motion
was
something
absolutely
essential
spear
in
hand
and
creeping
on
his
hands
and
knees
the
destroyer
advanced
along
the
drain
lying
flat
and
wriggling
with
much
patience
wherever
a
particularly
clear
stretch
of
sand
presented
itself
half
way
across
the
field
he
raised
his
head
with
a
movement
so
slow
that
a
full
minute
was
occupied
in
the
performance
parted
the
weeds
gently
and
peered
out
to
get
his
bearings
and
ascertain
if
any
foemen
were
in
sight
there
were
no
foemen
and
his
progress
had
made
with
no
less
adroitness
and
success
at
last
there
fell
upon
the
ear
of
the
avenger
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
he
was
close
to
the
house
and
the
morning
exercises
had
begun
here
was
the
moment
for
the
exhibition
of
all
south
sea
island
craft
and
the
moment
was
about
at
hand
too
for
exhibition
of
the
full
measure
of
a
south
sea
islander
s
ferocity
the
islander
glided
from
the
ditch
crept
to
the
house
and
slowly
put
forth
his
head
until
he
could
see
around
the
corner
there
within
three
feet
of
him
back
to
the
window
kneeling
beside
his
chair
and
this
killing
as
it
did
one
of
the
oldest
and
best
known
of
the
miners
had
created
an
intense
excitement
in
the
little
town
immediately
following
the
explosion
there
had
been
put
in
circulation
a
report
of
the
accident
so
exaggerated
that
it
had
brought
to
the
spot
the
wives
of
half
the
miners
in
the
camp
each
one
of
whom
was
confident
that
her
husband
was
among
the
twenty
or
more
men
said
to
have
been
killed
it
had
been
this
hasty
gathering
which
had
caught
grant
s
eye
and
the
everetts
and
allie
had
hurried
down
into
the
town
just
in
time
to
learn
the
truth
that
but
one
man
they
slowly
dispersed
so
noisy
in
their
joy
that
their
own
friends
had
escaped
that
they
forgot
to
give
more
than
a
passing
thought
to
poor
careless
mike
whose
working
days
were
ended
but
that
came
later
and
among
all
his
mourners
there
were
none
more
sincere
than
the
little
group
at
the
everetts
who
knew
and
appreciated
the
real
worth
of
the
jovial
brawny
irishman
whose
pleasant
word
and
helping
hand
were
extended
to
all
with
whom
he
ever
came
in
contact
they
were
still
talking
of
him
when
the
bell
rang
and
a
moment
later
wang
kum
ushered
dr
brownlee
into
the
parlor
at
sight
of
him
marjorie
sprang
up
impulsively
oh
doctor
tell
us
about
the
poor
boy
how
is
he
she
asked
abruptly
without
waiting
for
any
formal
greeting
if
you
mean
the
one
who
was
hurt
at
the
mine
this
afternoon
the
doctor
was
beginning
when
ned
hastily
interposed
hold
on
a
minute
chair
there
s
something
wrong
about
the
stuff
it
s
covered
with
tis
nt
real
leather
and
it
melts
and
gets
sticky
in
summer
or
when
there
s
a
hot
fire
you
d
better
steer
clear
of
it
we
mean
to
keep
it
out
of
the
way
you
might
use
it
for
a
trap
suggested
the
doctor
laughingly
as
he
pushed
aside
the
great
easy
chair
and
settled
himself
in
a
willow
rocker
then
his
face
grew
grave
again
as
he
turned
back
to
marjorie
he
s
as
badly
hurt
as
he
can
be
he
went
on
he
ll
get
over
it
but
he
ll
never
be
able
to
do
anything
more
he
has
nt
come
to
his
senses
yet
and
i
wish
he
need
nt
for
the
present
for
he
has
a
hard
time
before
him
he
added
as
he
rose
to
meet
louise
who
came
into
the
room
just
then
i
m
a
little
upset
to
night
about
the
coldness
of
his
hand
to
be
perfectly
honest
this
is
my
first
accident
case
and
it
s
a
very
different
thing
from
seeing
people
quietly
ill
in
bed
even
if
you
know
they
ca
nt
get
well
i
was
at
the
house
when
they
brought
him
in
and
i
hope
i
sha
nt
often
have
to
go
through
such
a
scene
again
tell
me
about
it
said
louise
with
a
gentle
sympathy
which
lent
a
new
grace
to
her
beauty
i
m
not
afraid
to
hear
and
perhaps
i
can
do
something
for
them
by
and
by
and
the
doctor
told
forgetting
himself
and
even
the
charming
young
woman
before
him
as
he
went
on
with
the
story
of
the
mother
s
frantic
sorrow
over
her
only
son
of
the
boy
s
half
conscious
suffering
and
of
the
long
helpless
life
before
him
the
girl
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
listened
though
her
pity
for
the
lad
was
mingled
with
a
new
entirely
in
the
mere
words
describing
the
accident
but
under
all
that
it
told
of
the
generous
kindly
sympathy
of
the
true
doctor
who
shrinks
from
the
sight
of
pain
even
while
he
gives
his
life
to
watching
and
helping
it
two
weeks
later
marjorie
was
spending
a
stormy
afternoon
at
the
burnams
when
ned
appeared
on
the
piazza
hullo
he
exclaimed
as
he
furled
his
dripping
umbrella
and
shook
himself
out
of
his
rubber
coat
you
d
better
believe
i
m
wet
lou
went
off
before
it
rained
and
i
had
to
pack
her
rubbers
and
umbrella
over
to
her
it
s
no
joke
to
walk
a
mile
in
such
a
pour
where
is
she
asked
allie
while
she
hospitably
drew
up
a
chair
for
her
guest
over
the
creek
with
that
boy
of
hers
she
puts
in
ever
so
much
time
there
since
he
s
better
she
says
he
s
crazy
to
read
and
be
read
to
responded
ned
as
he
wriggled
away
from
the
too
exuberant
caresses
of
ben
how
is
he
getting
on
inquired
marjorie
all
right
as
much
as
he
can
lou
says
he
s
bright
and
knows
a
good
deal
how
kind
she
s
been
to
him
said
allie
thoughtfully
and
charlie
too
he
buys
lots
of
things
for
him
and
sends
them
over
by
dr
brownlee
good
for
charlie
mac
that
s
just
like
him
said
ned
enthusiastically
where
is
he
anyhow
we
supposed
he
was
over
at
your
house
with
grant
answered
howard
from
the
corner
where
he
sat
industriously
whittling
at
a
set
of
small
wooden
pegs
it
must
be
nice
to
have
money
and
do
all
sorts
of
things
like
that
sighed
marjorie
i
ca
nt
afford
to
buy
books
and
fruit
for
i
m
always
short
on
my
allowance
and
mamma
wo
nt
let
me
give
i
ca
nt
do
what
miss
lou
does
poor
marj
it
s
a
hard
case
for
time
s
money
and
you
have
nt
any
of
either
remarked
howard
wait
a
minute
she
answered
starting
from
her
chair
and
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
as
was
her
habit
when
much
absorbed
i
m
getting
hold
of
an
idea
hold
on
then
and
do
nt
let
it
go
advised
ned
dodging
the
sofa
pillow
that
marjorie
hurled
at
him
listen
she
commanded
imperatively
it
s
really
and
truly
a
good
plan
you
know
we
have
nt
any
too
as
most
of
the
others
the
furniture
being
of
satin
wood
and
ivory
and
the
hangings
and
drapings
of
the
bed
and
windows
of
pink
velvet
and
white
lace
two
curiously
wrought
silver
lamps
stood
on
the
dressing
table
and
showed
that
they
had
burned
themselves
casket
it
was
open
and
showed
rings
and
aigrettes
of
diamonds
and
emeralds
a
few
ruby
ornaments
lay
on
the
table
and
a
string
of
pearls
also
a
small
lace
scarf
and
a
pair
of
lady
s
gloves
embroidered
on
the
backs
with
gold
the
curtains
and
velvet
draperies
of
the
windows
were
completely
closed
and
the
room
looked
as
though
some
one
had
dressed
in
it
and
gone
away
and
left
the
lamps
burning
everything
was
a
mystery
to
the
ladies
which
they
could
not
unravel
when
the
day
was
over
mrs
carleton
and
miss
vyvyan
sat
beside
the
sleeping
child
in
mrs
carleton
s
room
the
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
and
the
full
moon
poured
its
beams
in
at
the
windows
they
had
no
other
light
mrs
carleton
spoke
much
of
her
bereavement
but
struggled
to
be
brave
and
to
resign
herself
to
a
destiny
she
could
not
alter
at
the
same
time
revealing
quite
unawares
to
herself
a
character
full
of
intense
affection
unselfishness
pure
face
so
full
of
emotion
and
sensibility
and
the
firelight
flickered
upon
and
lit
up
the
refined
features
her
whole
heart
yearned
toward
her
new
friend
and
her
own
sorrow
was
buried
in
those
of
the
forlorn
young
mother
i
have
been
considering
said
miss
vyvyan
about
your
child
do
you
not
think
we
ought
to
make
life
as
bright
and
happy
as
we
can
for
her
and
we
can
do
a
great
deal
although
we
may
have
to
stay
in
exile
for
a
long
while
she
need
never
suffer
from
that
idea
all
will
depend
upon
the
way
we
educate
her
and
the
way
we
live
exactly
so
replied
mrs
carleton
we
will
make
our
lives
as
good
an
example
as
possible
we
will
bring
her
up
as
far
as
circumstances
will
admit
the
same
as
we
would
do
if
she
were
in
my
old
home
we
can
not
have
the
servants
we
have
been
accustomed
to
have
but
we
can
make
and
we
must
make
it
a
cheerful
one
for
her
sake
there
is
one
thing
i
feel
very
anxious
about
said
mrs
carleton
my
child
has
not
yet
been
baptized
as
i
told
you
we
were
going
to
take
her
to
england
for
that
purpose
i
should
feel
happier
if
i
could
carry
out
my
husband
s
wish
and
be
able
to
call
her
by
the
name
he
so
much
liked
i
can
fully
enter
into
your
feelings
said
miss
vyvyan
why
not
baptize
her
yourself
i
presume
you
are
familiar
with
the
service
as
we
have
baptisms
in
our
church
so
frequently
yes
replied
mrs
carleton
and
i
can
not
see
that
there
would
be
anything
wrong
in
doing
so
myself
as
there
is
not
any
one
else
to
do
it
it
can
no
more
be
wrong
said
anna
to
repeat
the
baptismal
prayers
for
your
child
than
it
is
to
offer
it
seems
perfectly
right
as
we
are
situated
at
present
i
am
glad
you
entertain
those
feelings
on
the
subject
miss
vyvyan
replied
mrs
carleton
and
as
we
are
both
of
the
english
church
will
you
be
godmother
to
my
little
one
you
confer
great
happiness
on
me
replied
anna
by
making
such
a
request
what
do
you
intend
to
call
her
cora
was
the
name
my
husband
wished
her
to
be
called
replied
mrs
carleton
and
i
desire
to
add
caroline
to
it
as
that
is
the
name
of
my
dear
mother
and
is
now
alas
the
only
means
i
have
of
showing
my
affection
for
her
who
is
perhaps
at
this
moment
mourning
my
absence
will
you
baptize
her
to
morrow
inquired
miss
vyvyan
if
you
will
we
can
make
a
dress
for
her
in
the
forenoon
there
is
an
abundance
of
white
india
muslin
and
cashmere
too
enough
yes
answered
mrs
carleton
i
like
that
idea
and
we
will
keep
her
always
dressed
in
white
and
as
to
yourself
said
anna
i
ask
you
as
a
favor
to
let
me
choose
for
you
in
this
instance
i
wish
you
always
to
be
beautifully
dressed
in
colors
that
will
look
bright
and
cheerful
i
think
it
will
have
an
influence
on
the
child
s
spirits
and
thence
on
her
health
i
do
not
feel
that
we
need
to
have
any
compunction
about
using
the
things
we
find
here
for
we
see
that
this
place
must
have
been
deserted
many
years
ago
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
all
these
costly
things
are
the
plunder
of
buccaneers
nothing
is
so
probable
answered
mrs
carleton
indeed
when
we
consider
for
a
moment
everything
seems
to
say
so
many
of
those
cases
which
still
remain
unopened
are
such
as
the
merchants
bring
to
the
colony
of
virginia
i
have
it
occurs
to
me
that
all
these
stores
are
the
cargoes
of
ships
that
have
been
robbed
by
those
desperate
men
who
have
been
and
still
are
the
terror
of
the
sea
but
why
they
left
this
place
so
suddenly
is
difficult
to
divine
unless
perhaps
retribution
fell
upon
them
when
they
were
out
at
sea
on
some
of
their
marauding
expeditions
evidently
a
lady
has
lived
here
too
perhaps
they
took
her
with
them
on
their
last
voyage
and
she
also
may
have
been
lost
so
i
think
we
may
feel
we
are
not
doing
wrong
in
using
such
things
as
are
necessary
to
our
existence
while
we
are
here
the
next
morning
the
ladies
were
up
early
busying
themselves
with
their
preparations
for
the
child
s
baptism
as
they
sat
by
the
open
window
in
the
green
parlor
making
the
little
white
dress
the
sunlight
falling
upon
the
floor
the
soft
warm
breeze
from
the
south
coming
blazing
pyramidal
invitation
when
the
doors
were
burst
in
he
paused
a
moment
to
see
if
mahommed
were
coming
the
hordes
are
here
o
princess
but
not
the
sultan
she
raised
her
veil
and
regarded
him
silently
i
see
now
but
one
resort
as
mirza
the
emir
i
must
meet
the
pillagers
by
claiming
the
sultan
sent
me
in
we
are
at
mercy
count
corti
she
replied
heaven
deal
with
you
as
you
deal
with
us
if
the
ruse
fails
princess
i
can
die
for
you
now
tie
yourselves
as
before
two
and
two
hand
to
hand
it
may
be
they
will
call
on
me
to
distinguish
such
as
are
my
charge
she
cast
a
glance
of
pity
about
her
and
these
count
these
poor
women
not
of
my
house
and
the
children
can
you
not
save
them
also
alas
dear
lady
the
blessed
mother
must
be
their
shield
while
the
veils
were
being
applied
the
surge
against
the
railing
took
place
leaving
a
number
of
dead
and
fainting
across
it
hadifah
the
count
called
out
clear
the
way
to
yon
chair
against
the
wall
the
sheik
set
about
removing
the
persons
blockading
the
space
and
greatly
affected
by
their
condition
the
princess
interceded
for
them
not
to
their
terror
i
pray
but
the
count
was
a
soldier
in
case
of
an
affray
he
wanted
the
advantage
of
a
wall
at
his
back
dear
lady
it
was
the
throne
of
your
fathers
now
yours
i
will
seat
you
there
from
it
you
can
best
treat
with
the
lord
mahommed
ere
long
some
of
the
hordes
half
a
dozen
or
more
came
to
the
chancel
gate
they
were
of
the
rudest
class
of
anatolian
shepherds
clad
principally
in
half
cloaks
of
shaggy
goat
skin
each
bore
at
his
back
a
round
buckler
a
bow
and
a
clumsy
quiver
of
feathered
arrows
awed
by
the
splendor
of
the
altar
and
its
surroundings
they
stopped
then
with
shouts
they
rushed
at
the
tempting
display
unmindful
of
the
living
spoils
crouched
on
the
floor
dumb
with
terror
others
of
a
like
kind
reenforced
them
and
there
was
a
fierce
scramble
the
latest
comers
turned
to
the
women
and
presently
discovered
the
princess
than
the
rest
was
indisposed
to
respect
the
berbers
here
are
slaves
worth
having
get
your
ropes
he
shouted
to
his
companions
the
count
interposed
art
thou
a
believer
he
asked
in
turkish
they
surveyed
him
doubtfully
and
then
turned
to
hadifah
and
his
men
tall
imperturbable
looking
their
dark
faces
visible
through
their
open
hoods
of
steel
they
looked
at
their
shields
also
and
at
their
bare
cimeters
resting
points
to
the
floor
why
do
you
ask
the
man
returned
because
as
thou
mayst
see
we
also
are
of
the
faithful
and
do
not
wish
harm
to
any
whose
mothers
have
taught
them
to
begin
the
day
with
the
fah
hat
the
fellow
was
impressed
who
art
thou
i
am
the
emir
mirza
of
the
household
of
our
lord
the
padishah
to
whom
be
all
the
promises
of
the
koran
these
are
slaves
i
selected
for
him
all
these
thou
seest
in
bonds
will
be
here
directly
he
is
now
coming
a
man
wearing
a
bloody
tarbousche
joined
the
pillagers
during
this
colloquy
and
pressing
in
heard
the
emir
s
name
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
emir
mirza
i
knew
him
brethren
he
commanded
the
caravan
and
kept
the
mahmals
the
year
i
made
the
pilgrimage
stand
off
and
let
me
see
after
a
short
inspection
he
continued
truly
as
there
is
no
god
but
god
this
is
he
i
was
next
him
at
the
most
holy
corner
of
the
kaaba
when
he
fell
down
struck
by
the
plague
i
saw
him
kiss
the
black
stone
and
by
virtue
of
the
kiss
he
lived
ay
stand
back
or
if
you
touch
him
or
one
of
these
in
his
charge
and
escape
his
hand
ye
shall
not
escape
the
padishah
whose
first
sword
he
is
even
as
khalid
was
first
sword
for
the
prophet
exalted
be
his
name
give
kissed
the
count
s
hand
arise
o
son
of
thy
father
said
corti
and
when
our
master
the
lord
mahommed
hath
set
up
his
court
and
harem
seek
me
for
reward
the
man
stayed
awhile
although
there
was
no
further
show
of
interference
and
he
looked
past
the
princess
to
lael
cowering
near
her
he
took
no
interest
in
what
was
going
on
around
him
lael
alone
attracted
him
at
last
he
shifted
his
sheepskin
covering
higher
upon
his
shoulders
and
left
these
words
with
the
count
the
women
are
not
for
the
harem
i
understand
thee
o
mirza
when
the
lord
mahommed
hath
set
up
his
court
do
thou
tell
the
little
jewess
yonder
that
her
father
the
prince
of
india
charged
thee
to
give
her
his
undying
love
count
corti
was
wonder
struck
he
could
not
speak
and
so
the
wandering
jew
vanished
from
his
sight
as
he
now
vanishes
from
our
story
the
selection
among
the
other
refugees
in
such
as
were
considered
not
worth
the
having
a
long
time
passed
during
which
the
princess
irene
sat
with
veil
drawn
close
trying
to
shut
out
the
horror
of
the
scene
her
attendants
clinging
to
the
throne
and
to
each
other
seemed
a
heap
of
dead
women
at
last
a
crash
of
music
was
heard
in
the
vestibule
drums
cymbals
and
trumpets
in
blatant
flourish
four
runners
slender
lads
in
short
sleeveless
jackets
over
white
shirts
and
wide
trousers
of
yellow
silk
barefooted
and
bareheaded
stepped
lightly
through
the
central
doorway
and
waving
wands
tipped
with
silver
balls
cried
in
long
toned
shrill
iteration
the
lord
mahommed
mahommed
sultan
of
sultans
the
spoilsmen
suspended
their
hideous
labor
the
victims
moved
doubtless
by
a
hope
of
rescue
gave
over
their
lamentations
and
struggling
only
the
young
children
and
the
wounded
and
suffering
persisted
in
vexing
the
floor
and
galleries
next
to
enter
were
the
five
official
heralds
halting
thousands
of
eyes
tells
them
that
it
s
a
round
globe
like
a
ball
or
an
orange
do
nt
be
impolite
the
less
they
know
about
the
old
world
the
better
they
get
on
i
dare
say
your
colossal
fund
of
worldly
knowledge
does
nt
seem
to
make
you
very
happy
just
now
how
could
you
lose
your
money
i
ask
you
re
nothing
but
a
student
and
you
are
not
in
any
business
are
you
yes
is
too
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
ve
been
winding
myself
up
into
a
hard
knot
the
last
six
months
and
the
more
i
try
to
disentangle
myself
the
worse
the
thing
gets
my
allowance
is
nt
half
enough
nobody
but
a
miser
could
live
on
it
i
ve
been
unlucky
too
i
bought
a
dog
and
some
one
poisoned
him
before
i
could
sell
him
then
i
lamed
a
horse
from
the
livery
stable
and
had
to
pay
damages
and
so
it
went
the
fellows
all
kept
lending
me
money
rather
than
let
me
stay
out
of
the
little
club
suppers
and
since
i
ve
shut
down
on
expensive
gayeties
they
ve
gone
back
on
me
and
all
want
their
money
at
once
so
does
the
livery
stable
keeper
and
the
owner
of
the
dog
and
a
dozen
other
individuals
in
fact
the
debtors
prison
yawns
before
me
upon
my
word
i
considerable
heat
to
waste
money
in
that
way
when
you
knew
perfectly
well
you
could
nt
afford
it
was
well
it
was
downright
dishonest
that
s
what
it
was
to
hear
you
talk
about
dogs
and
lame
horses
and
club
suppers
anybody
would
suppose
you
were
a
sporting
man
pray
what
else
do
they
do
in
that
charming
college
set
of
yours
i
might
have
known
you
would
take
that
tone
but
i
did
nt
somehow
i
told
you
just
because
i
thought
you
were
the
one
girl
in
a
thousand
who
would
understand
and
advise
a
fellow
when
he
knows
he
s
made
a
fool
of
himself
and
acted
like
a
cur
i
did
nt
suppose
you
would
call
hard
names
and
be
so
unsympathizing
after
all
we
have
gone
through
together
i
m
not
i
did
nt
i
wo
nt
do
it
again
said
polly
incoherently
as
she
took
a
straight
chair
planted
her
elbows
on
the
table
now
let
s
talk
about
it
tell
me
everything
quickly
how
much
is
it
nearly
two
hundred
dollars
do
nt
shudder
so
provokingly
polly
that
s
a
mere
bagatelle
for
a
college
man
but
i
know
it
s
a
good
deal
for
me
a
good
deal
more
than
i
know
how
to
get
at
all
events
where
is
the
debtors
prison
asked
polly
in
an
awestruck
whisper
oh
there
is
nt
any
such
thing
nowadays
i
was
only
chaffing
but
of
course
the
men
to
whom
i
am
in
debt
can
apply
to
father
and
get
me
in
a
regular
mess
i
ve
pawned
my
watch
to
stave
one
of
them
off
you
see
polly
i
would
rather
die
than
do
it
nevertheless
i
would
write
and
tell
father
everything
and
ask
him
for
the
money
but
circumstances
conspire
just
at
this
time
to
make
it
impossible
you
know
he
bought
that
great
ranch
in
ventura
died
insolvent
and
father
has
to
make
certain
payments
or
lose
control
of
a
valuable
property
it
s
going
to
make
him
a
rich
man
some
time
but
for
a
year
or
two
we
shall
have
to
count
every
penny
of
course
the
fruit
crop
this
season
has
been
the
worst
in
ten
years
and
of
course
there
has
been
a
frost
this
winter
the
only
severe
one
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
that
s
the
way
it
always
is
and
there
i
am
i
suppose
you
despise
me
polly
yes
i
do
hotly
no
i
do
nt
altogether
and
i
m
not
good
enough
myself
to
be
able
to
despise
people
besides
you
are
not
a
despisable
boy
you
were
born
manly
and
generous
and
true
hearted
and
these
hateful
things
that
you
have
been
doing
are
not
a
part
of
your
nature
a
bit
but
i
m
ashamed
of
you
for
yielding
to
bad
impulses
when
you
have
so
very
same
thing
myself
now
that
i
stop
to
think
about
it
but
how
could
you
you
edgar
noble
take
that
evil
eyed
fat
nosed
common
tony
selling
for
a
friend
i
wonder
at
you
he
is
nt
so
bad
in
some
ways
i
owe
him
eighty
dollars
of
that
money
and
he
says
he
ll
give
me
six
months
to
pay
it
i
m
glad
he
has
some
small
virtues
polly
replied
witheringly
now
what
can
we
do
edgar
let
us
think
what
can
what
can
we
do
and
she
leaned
forward
reflectively
clasping
her
knee
with
her
hands
and
wrinkling
her
brow
with
intense
thought
that
little
we
fell
on
edgar
s
loneliness
of
spirit
consolingly
for
it
adds
a
new
pang
to
self
distrust
when
righteous
people
withdraw
from
one
in
utter
disdain
even
if
they
are
only
girls
who
know
little
of
a
boy
s
temptations
if
you
can
save
something
said
polly
finally
with
a
brighter
look
i
can
spare
fifty
or
even
seventy
five
dollars
of
our
money
and
you
may
pay
it
back
as
you
can
we
are
not
likely
to
need
it
for
several
months
and
your
father
and
mother
ought
not
to
be
troubled
with
this
matter
now
that
it
s
over
and
done
with
the
blood
rushed
to
edgar
s
face
as
he
replied
stiffly
i
may
be
selfish
and
recklessly
extravagant
but
i
do
nt
borrow
money
from
girls
if
you
wanted
to
add
the
last
touch
to
my
shame
you
ve
done
it
do
nt
you
suppose
i
have
eyes
polly
oliver
do
nt
you
suppose
i
ve
hated
myself
ever
since
i
came
under
this
roof
when
i
have
seen
the
way
you
worked
and
planned
and
plotted
on
the
sick
flowers
and
then
again
instantly
on
the
wing
the
plants
around
feel
the
too
potent
fervours
the
tall
maize
rolls
up
its
long
green
leaves
the
clover
droops
its
tender
foliage
and
declines
its
blooms
but
far
in
the
fierce
sunshine
tower
the
hills
with
all
their
growth
of
woods
silent
and
stern
as
if
the
scorching
heat
and
dazzling
light
were
but
an
element
they
loved
bright
clouds
motionless
pillars
of
the
brazen
heaven
their
bases
on
the
mountains
their
white
tops
shining
in
the
far
ether
fire
the
air
with
a
reflected
radiance
and
make
turn
the
gazer
s
eye
away
for
me
i
lie
languidly
in
the
shade
where
the
thick
turf
yet
virgin
from
the
kisses
of
the
sun
retains
some
freshness
and
i
woo
the
wind
that
still
delays
its
coming
why
so
slow
gentle
and
voluble
spirit
of
the
air
oh
come
and
breathe
that
in
his
caves
he
hears
me
see
on
yonder
woody
ridge
the
pine
is
bending
his
proud
top
and
now
among
the
nearer
groves
chestnut
and
oak
are
tossing
their
green
boughs
about
he
comes
lo
where
the
grassy
meadow
runs
in
waves
the
deep
distressful
silence
of
the
scene
breaks
up
with
mingling
of
unnumbered
sounds
and
universal
motion
he
is
come
shaking
a
shower
of
blossoms
from
the
shrubs
and
bearing
on
their
fragrance
and
he
brings
music
of
birds
and
rustling
of
young
boughs
and
sound
of
swaying
branches
and
the
voice
of
distant
waterfalls
all
the
green
herbs
are
stirring
in
his
breath
a
thousand
flowers
by
the
road
side
and
the
borders
of
the
brook
nod
gayly
to
each
other
glossy
leaves
are
twinkling
in
the
sun
as
if
the
dew
were
on
them
yet
and
silver
waters
break
into
small
waves
and
sparkle
as
he
comes
an
indian
at
the
burial
place
of
his
fathers
it
is
the
spot
i
came
from
these
vales
ashamed
and
weak
withdrew
our
wasted
race
it
is
the
spot
i
know
it
well
of
which
our
old
traditions
tell
for
here
the
upland
bank
sends
out
a
ridge
toward
the
river
side
i
know
the
shaggy
hills
about
the
meadows
smooth
and
wide
the
plains
that
toward
the
southern
sky
fenced
east
and
west
by
mountains
lie
a
white
man
gazing
on
the
scene
would
say
a
lovely
spot
was
here
and
praise
the
lawns
so
fresh
and
green
between
the
hills
so
sheer
i
like
it
not
i
would
the
plain
lay
in
its
tall
old
groves
again
the
sheep
are
on
the
slopes
around
the
cattle
in
the
meadows
feed
and
labourers
turn
the
crumbling
ground
or
drop
the
yellow
seed
and
prancing
steeds
in
trappings
gay
whirl
the
bright
chariot
o
er
the
way
methinks
it
were
a
nobler
sight
to
see
these
vales
in
woods
arrayed
their
summits
in
the
golden
light
their
trunks
in
grateful
shade
and
prostrate
trees
below
and
then
to
mark
the
lord
of
all
the
forest
hero
trained
to
wars
quivered
and
plumed
and
lithe
and
tall
and
seamed
with
glorious
scars
walk
forth
amid
his
reign
to
dare
the
wolf
and
grapple
with
the
bear
this
bank
in
which
the
dead
were
laid
was
sacred
when
its
soil
was
ours
hither
the
artless
indian
maid
brought
wreaths
of
beads
and
flowers
and
the
gray
chief
and
gifted
seer
worshipped
the
god
of
thunders
here
but
now
the
wheat
is
green
and
high
on
clods
that
hid
the
warrior
s
breast
and
scattered
in
the
furrows
lie
the
weapons
of
his
rest
and
there
in
the
loose
sand
is
thrown
of
his
large
arm
the
mouldering
bone
ah
little
thought
the
strong
and
brave
who
bore
their
lifeless
chieftain
forth
or
the
young
wife
that
weeping
gave
her
first
born
to
the
earth
that
the
pale
race
who
waste
us
now
among
their
bones
should
guide
the
plough
we
shrink
away
and
fast
they
follow
as
we
go
towards
the
setting
day
till
they
shall
fill
the
land
and
we
are
driven
into
the
western
sea
but
i
behold
a
fearful
sign
to
which
the
white
men
s
eyes
are
blind
their
race
may
vanish
hence
like
mine
and
leave
no
trace
behind
save
ruins
o
er
the
region
spread
and
the
white
stones
above
the
dead
before
these
fields
were
shorn
and
tilled
full
to
the
brim
our
rivers
flowed
the
melody
of
waters
filled
the
fresh
and
boundless
wood
and
torrents
dashed
and
rivulets
played
and
fountains
spouted
in
the
shade
those
grateful
sounds
are
heard
no
more
the
springs
are
silent
in
the
sun
the
rivers
by
the
blackened
shore
with
lessening
current
run
the
realm
our
tribes
are
crushed
to
get
may
be
a
barren
desert
yet
song
dost
thou
idly
ask
to
hear
at
what
gentle
seasons
nymphs
relent
when
lovers
near
press
the
tenderest
reasons
ah
wooer
maidens
hearts
are
always
soft
would
that
men
s
were
truer
woo
the
fair
one
when

the

early
herbs
are
springing
when
the
brookside
bank
and
grove
all
with
blossoms
laden
shine
with
beauty
breathe
of
love
woo
the
timid
maiden
woo
her
when
with
rosy

summer
eve
is
sinking
when
on
rills
that

winking

through

of

hear
father
hear
thy
faint
afflicted
flock
cry
to
thee
from
the
desert
and
the
school
master
it
is
too
short
people
want
greater
quantity
well
here
is
quantity
for
you
said
the
idiot
quantity
as
she
is
not
wanted
by
nine
comic
papers
i
wot
of
this
poem
is
called
the
turning
of
the
ll
gather
in
my
dearest
reader
when
i
tell
you
that
i
entered
into
this
fair
world
a
twin
the
one
was
spare
enough
the
other
fat
i
was
of
course
the
lean
one
of
the
two
the
homelier
as
well
and
consequently
in
ecstasy
o
er
jim
my
parents
flew
and
good
of
me
was
spoken
accident
ly
as
boys
we
went
to
school
and
jim
of
course
was
e
er
his
teacher
s
favorite
and
ranked
among
the
lads
renowned
for
moral
force
whilst
i
was
every
day
right
soundly
spanked
jim
had
an
angel
face
but
there
he
stopped
i
never
knew
a
lad
who
d
sin
so
oft
and
look
so
like
a
branch
of
heaven
lopped
from
off
the
parent
trunk
that
grows
aloft
i
seemed
an
imp
indeed
t
was
often
said
that
i
resembled
much
beelzebub
my
face
was
freckled
and
my
hair
was
red
the
kind
of
looking
boy
that
men
call
scrub
kind
everything
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
said
my
prayers
thrice
daily
and
i
sought
in
all
my
ways
to
do
the
right
and
good
on
saturdays
i
d
do
my
monday
s
sums
while
jim
would
spend
the
day
in
search
of
fun
he
d
sneak
away
and
steal
the
neighbors
plums
and
strange
to
say
to
earth
was
never
run
whilst
i
when
study
time
was
haply
through
would
seek
my
brother
in
the
neighbor
s
orchard
would
find
the
neighbor
there
with
anger
blue
and
as
the
thieving
culprit
would
be
tortured
the
sums
i
d
done
he
d
steal
this
lad
forsaken
then
change
my
work
so
that
a
paltry
four
would
be
my
mark
whilst
he
had
overtaken
the
maximum
and
all
the
prizes
bore
in
later
years
we
loved
the
self
same
maid
we
sent
her
little
presents
sweets
bouquets
for
which
alas
t
was
i
that
always
paid
and
we
entered
politics
in
different
roles
and
for
a
minor
office
each
did
run
t
was
i
was
left
left
badly
at
the
polls
because
of
fishy
things
that
jim
had
done
when
jim
went
into
business
and
failed
i
signed
his
notes
and
freed
him
from
the
strife
which
bankruptcy
and
ruin
hath
entailed
on
them
that
lead
a
queer
financial
life
then
penniless
i
learned
that
jim
had
set
aside
before
his
failure
hard
to
tell
a
half
a
million
dollars
on
his
pet
his
mrs
jim
the
former
lovely
nell
that
wearied
me
of
jim
it
may
be
right
for
one
to
bear
another
s
cross
but
i
quite
fail
to
see
it
in
its
proper
light
if
that
s
the
rule
man
should
be
guided
by
and
since
a
fate
perverse
has
had
the
wit
to
mix
us
up
so
that
the
one
s
deserts
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
other
sit
no
matter
how
the
other
one
it
hurts
i
am
resolved
or
where
or
how
i
do
not
reck
so
long
as
law
will
end
this
horrid
strife
and
twist
my
dear
twin
brother
s
sinful
neck
there
said
the
idiot
putting
down
the
manuscript
how
s
that
i
do
nt
like
it
said
mr
whitechoker
it
is
immoral
and
vindictive
you
should
accept
the
hardships
of
life
no
matter
how
unjust
the
conclusion
of
your
poem
horrifies
me
sir
i
illustration
curing
insomnia
have
you
tried
your
hand
at
dialect
poetry
asked
the
doctor
yes

said
the
idiot
i
sent
it
to
the
great
western
weekly
oh
yes
here
it
is
sent
back
with
thanks
it
s
an

you

all
my
sorrows
away
ingenious
but
vicious
said
the
school
master
who
does
not
smoke
again
thanks
how
is
this
for
a
sonnet
said
the
idiot
when
to
the
sessions
of
sweet
silent
thought
i
summon
up
remembrance
of
things
past
i
sigh
the
lack
of
many
a
thing
i
sought
and
with
old
woes
new
wail
my
dear
time
s
waste
then
can
i
drown
an
eye
unused
to
flow
for
precious
friends
hid
in
death
s
dateless
night
and
weep
afresh
love
s
long
since
cancel
d
woe
and
moan
the
expense
of
many
a
vanish
d
sight
then
can
i
grieve
at
grievances
foregone
and
heavily
from
woe
to
woe
tell
o
er
the
sad
account
of
fore
bemoaned
moan
which
i
now
pay
as
if
not
paid
before
but
if
the
while
i
think
of
thee
dear
friend
all
losses
are
restored
and
sorrows
end
it
is
bosh
perfect
bosh
repeated
the
school
master
and
only
shows
how
in
weak
hands
so
beautiful
a
thing
as
the
sonnet
can
be
made
ridiculous
what
s
wrong
with
it
asked
the
idiot
it
does
nt
contain
any
thought
or
if
it
does
no
one
can
tell
what
the
thought
is
your
rhymes
are
atrocious
your
phraseology
is
ridiculous
the
whole
thing
is
bad
you
ll
never
get
anybody
to
print
it
i
do
not
intend
to
try
said
the
idiot
meekly
you
are
wise
said
the
school
master
to
take
my
advice
for
once
no
it
is
not
your
advice
that
restrains
me
said
the
idiot
dryly
it
is
the
fact
that
this
sonnet
has
already
been
printed
in
the
name
of
letters
where
cried
the
school
master
in
the
collected
works
of
william
shakespeare
replied
the
idiot
quietly
the
poet
laughed
mrs
smithers
s
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say
xi
do
you
believe
mr
whitechoker
said
the
idiot
taking
his
place
at
the
table
and
holding
his
plate
up
to
the
light
apparently
to
under
all
other
sounds
of
life
but
steadily
and
with
sweet
monotony
the
world
of
little
living
things
in
grass
and
thicket
made
itself
heard
the
dewy
darkness
was
a
pleasure
to
angelique
but
peggy
moved
restlessly
and
finally
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
neck
and
leaned
against
the
window
side
watching
as
well
as
she
could
the
queen
of
hearts
opposite
she
could
herself
feel
angelique
s
charm
of
beautiful
health
and
outreaching
sympathy
peggy
was
a
candid
girl
and
had
no
self
deceptions
but
she
did
have
that
foreknowledge
of
herself
which
lives
a
germ
in
some
unformed
girls
whose
development
surprises
everybody
she
knew
she
could
become
a
woman
of
strength
and
influence
the
best
wife
in
the
territory
for
an
ambitious
man
who
had
the
wisdom
to
choose
her
her
sharp
fairness
would
round
out
moreover
and
her
red
head
melting
the
snows
which
fell
in
middle
age
crown
at
an
age
when
angelique
would
be
faded
peggy
s
richest
bloom
would
appear
she
was
like
the
wild
grapes
under
the
bluffs
it
required
frost
to
ripen
her
but
women
whom
nature
thus
obliges
to
wait
for
beauty
seldom
do
it
graciously
transition
is
not
repose
well
which
is
it
to
be
rice
jones
or
pierre
menard
be
candid
with
me
angelique
as
i
would
be
with
you
you
know
you
will
have
to
decide
some
time
i
do
not
think
monsieur
reece
zhone
is
for
me
said
angelique
with
intuitive
avoidance
of
colonel
menard
s
name
peggy
cared
nothing
for
the
fate
of
colonel
menard
indeed
i
believe
his
mind
dwells
more
on
his
sister
now
than
on
any
one
else
i
hate
people
s
relations
cried
peggy
brutally
especially
their
sick
relations
i
could
nt
run
every
evening
to
pet
maria
jones
and
feed
her
pap
i
do
not
pet
her
nor
the
defensive
do
nt
be
a
little
beast
peggy
she
added
in
french
i
see
how
it
is
you
are
going
to
take
him
the
man
who
needs
a
bug
in
his
ear
worse
than
any
other
man
in
the
territory
will
never
be
handed
over
to
me
to
get
it
but
let
me
tell
you
you
will
have
your
hands
full
with
rice
jones
this
welsh
english
stock
is
not
soft
stuff
to
manage
when
he
makes
that
line
with
his
lips
that
looks
like
a
red
hot
razor
edge
his
poor
wife
will
wish
to
leave
this
earth
and
take
to
the
bluffs
you
appear
to
think
a
great
deal
about
monsieur
reece
zhone
and
his
future
wife
said
angelique
mischievously
i
know
what
you
mean
said
peggy
defiantly
and
we
may
as
well
have
it
out
now
as
any
time
if
you
throw
him
at
me
i
shall
quarrel
with
you
i
detest
rice
jones
he
makes
me
crosser
than
any
you
detest
a
man
like
that
i
am
almost
afraid
of
him
he
has
a
wonderful
force
it
is
a
great
thing
at
his
age
to
be
elected
to
the
national
assembly
as
the
leader
of
his
party
in
the
territory
i
am
not
afraid
of
him
said
peggy
with
a
note
of
pride
no
for
i
have
sometimes
thought
peggy
that
monsieur
reece
zhone
and
you
were
made
for
each
other
peggy
morrison
sneered
her
nervous
laughter
however
had
a
sound
of
jubilation
the
talk
stopped
there
they
could
see
fog
rising
like
a
smoke
from
the
earth
gradually
making
distant
indistinct
objects
an
obliterated
memory
and
filling
the
place
where
the
garden
had
been
we
must
go
in
and
call
for
candles
said
angelique
no
said
peggy
turning
on
the
broad
sill
and
stretching
herself
along
it
let
me
lay
my
head
in
your
lap
and
watch
that
lovely
mist
come
up
like
a
dream
good
girl
angelique
part
third
the
rising
father
baby
s
part
in
the
common
fields
lay
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
peninsula
quite
three
miles
from
town
the
common
fields
as
an
entire
tract
belonged
to
the
community
of
kaskaskia
no
individual
held
any
purchased
or
transferable
right
in
them
each

wished
to
could
claim
his
proportion
of
acres
and

crop
he
pleased

no
rent
but
neither
did
he
hold
any
fee

the
land

on
rainy
summer
mornings
the
friar
loved
to
hoist
his
capote
on
the
cord
and
tramp
bare
legged
out
to
his
two
acre
farm
leaving
his
slave
with
a
few
small
coins
in
the
till
to
keep
shop
should
any
customer
forestall
his
return
the
fathers
of

explained
father
baby
from
their
earliest
foundations
have
counted
it
a
worthy
mortification
of
the
flesh
to
till
the
ground
and
be
ready
to
refresh
me
without
grinning
when
i
might
send
you
if
i
were
a
man
who
loved
sinful
ease
monastic
habits
are
above
the
understanding
of
a
black
rascal
like
you
the
truth
was
the
friar
loved
to
play
in
wet
dirt
civilized
life
and
the
confinement
of
a
shop
worked
a
kind
of
ferment
in
his
wild
spirit
which
violent
dancing
somewhat
relieved
but
which
intimate
contact
with
the
earth
cooled
and
settled
father
baby
sometimes
stripped
off
his
capote
and
lay
down
in
the
hollow
between
furrows
of
corn
like
a
very
lean
but
peaceful
pig
he
would
not
have
been
seen
on
any
account
and
lifted
an
apprehensive
head
in
the
darkness
of
the
morning
if
a
bird
rustled
past
this
performance
he
called
a
mortification
of
his
frame
but
when
this
sly
churchman
slipped
up
and
put
on
his
capote
again
his
thin
visage
bore
the
same
gratified
lines
which
may
be
seen
on
the
face
of
a
child
making
mud
pies
it
had
rained
steadily
since
the
political
field
day
which
had
drawn
such
risen
and
father
baby
s
way
to
his
work
had
been
across
fields
of
puddles
through
which
he
waded
before
dawn
knowing
well
that
a
week
s
growth
of
weeds
was
waiting
for
him
not
much
puffed
up
or
he
had
the
art
of
concealment
they
saw
alexandria
in
a
the
day
he
was
a
modest
young
fellow
with
a
nose
rather
too
large
for
his
face
a
long
upper
lip
and
frank
blue
eyes
he
made
himself
agreeable
to
one
of
the
cabinet
girls
on
the
front
seat
while
tommy
just
behind
him
had
miss
van
harlem
and
bliss
for
his
portion
the
old
streets
the
toppling
roofs
the
musty
warehouses
the
uneven
pavement
all
pleased
the
young
creatures
out
in
the
sunshine
they
made
merry
over
the
ancient
ball
room
where
washington
had
asked
a
far
away
ancestress
of
beatoun
to
dance
and
they
decorously
walked
through
the
old
church
it
happened
in
the
church
mrs
carriswood
was
behind
the
others
so
she
saw
them
come
in
the
same
little
old
couple
of
the
capitol
in
the
chancel
beatoun
was
explaining
beside
beatoun
shone
a
curly
black
head
that
they
knew
mrs
carriswood
sat
in
one
of
the
high
old
pews
through
a
crack
she
could
look
into
the
next
pew
and
there
they
stood
molly
let
s
be
getting
out
of
this
he
is
here
with
all
his
grand
friends
do
nt
let
us
be
interrupting
him
the
old
woman
s
voice
was
so
like
tommy
s
that
it
made
mrs
carriswood
start
very
softly
she
spoke
i
only
want
to
look
at
him
a
minute
pat
jest
a
minute
i
ai
nt
seen
him
for
so
long
and
is
it
any
longer
for
you
than
for
me
retorted
the
husband
ye
know
what
ye
promised
if
i
d
be
taking
you
here
unbeknownst
do
nt
look
his
way
look
like
ye
was
a
stranger
to
him
do
nt
let
us
be
mortifying
him
wid
our
country
ways
like
as
not
t
is
the
prisidint
himself
he
is
colloguein
wid
this
blessed
minute
shtep
back
and
be
a
stranger
to
him
woman
a
stranger
to
him
his
own
mother
but
she
stepped
back
she
turned
her
patient
face
then
all
over
his
face
he
took
two
steps
down
the
aisle
and
caught
the
little
figure
in
his
arms
why
mother
he
cried
why
mother
where
did
you
drop
from
and
before
mrs
carriswood
could
speak
she
saw
him
step
back
and
push
young
sackville
forward
crying
this
is
my
father
this
is
the
boy
that
knew
your
grandmother
he
did
it
so
easily
he
was
so
entirely
unaffected
so
perfectly
unconscious
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
embarrassing
for
anyone
even
the
cabinet
girl
with
a
grandmother
in
very
humble
life
who
must
be
kept
in
the
background
could
not
feel
disconcerted
for
this
happy
result
mrs
carriswood
owns
a
share
of
the
credit
she
advanced
on
the
first
pause
and
claimed
acquaintanceship
with
the
fitzmaurices
the
story
of
their
last
meeting
and
tommy
s
first
triumph
in
oratory
came
of
course
the
famous
horseshoe
received
due
mention
and
tommy
described
with
much
humor
his
terror
of
passage
was
a
natural
transition
equally
natural
the
transition
to
tommy
s
grandmother
the
irish
famine
and
the
benevolence
of
lady
sackville
everybody
was
interested
and
it
was
sackville
himself
who
brought
the
fitzmaurices
noble
ancestors
the
apocryphal
viscounts
fitzmaurice
of
king
james
s
creation
on
to
the
carpet
he
was
entirely
serious
my
grandmother
told
me
of
your
great
grandfather
lord
fitzmaurice
she
saw
him
ride
to
hounds
once
when
she
was
a
little
girl
they
say
he
was
the
boldest
rider
in
ireland
and
a
renowned
duellist
too
king
james
gave
the
title
to
his
grandfather
did
nt
he
and
the
countryside
kept
it
if
it
was
given
rather
too
late
in
the
day
to
be
useful
i
am
glad
you
have
restored
the
family
fortunes
mr
fitzmaurice
the
cabinet
girl
looked
on
tommy
with
respect
and
miss
van
harlem
blushed
like
an
angel
all
is
lost
said
mrs
carriswood
to
herself
yet
she
smiled
going
home
old
virginian
dinner
had
been
most
successful
the
fitzmaurices
who
had
been
almost
forced
into
the
banquet
by
beatoun
s
imperious
hospitality
were
not
a
wet
blanket
in
the
least
patrick
fitzmaurice
brogue
and
all
was
an
irish
gentleman
without
a
flaw
he
blossomed
out
into
a
modest
wag
and
told
two
or
three
comic
stories
as
acceptably
as
he
was
used
to
tell
them
to
a
very
different
circle
only
carrying
a
fresher
flavor
of
wit
to
this
circle
perhaps
it
enjoyed
them
more
mrs
fitzmaurice
looked
scared
and
ate
almost
nothing
with
the
greatest
propriety
and
her
fork
in
her
left
hand
yet
even
she
thawed
under
miss
van
harlem
s
attentions
and
gentle
mrs
beatoun
s
tact
and
the
winning
ways
of
the
last
beatoun
baby
she
took
this
absent
cherub
to
her
heart
with
such
undissembled
warmth
that
its
mother
ever
since
has
called
her
a
sweet
funny
little
old
lady
they
were
both
patrick
and
his
wife
quite
unassuming
and
retiring
company
at
the
tavern
door
my
word
tommy
your
mother
and
i
can
git
home
by
ourselves
whispered
honest
patrick
we
ve
not
exceeded
if
the
wines
were
good
i
never
exceeded
in
my
life
god
take
the
glory
but
he
embraced
tommy
so
affectionately
in
parting
that
i
confess
mrs
carriswood
had
suspicions
yet
surely
it
is
more
likely
that
his
brain
was
let
us
not
say
turned
but
just
a
wee
bit
tilted
by
the
joy
and
triumph
of
the
occasion
rather
than
by
beatoun
s
port
or
champagne
but
mrs
carriswood
s
word
had
nothing
to
do
with
tommy
s
parents
ostensibly
though
in
truth
it
had
everything
to
do
she
said
will
you
dine
with
us
to
morrow
quite
en
famille
thomas
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
suppose
that
i
find
your
house
a
pretty
dangerous
paradise
mrs
carriswood
says
tommy
and
i
find
you
a
most
dangerous
you
thank
you
answers
tommy
in
a
different
tone

always
been
an
angel

return
from

west
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
remember
your
kindness

ve
only
ventured
to
trouble
mr

in
regard
to
the
mistake
he
seems
to
have
made
with
roberts
roberts
i
beg
you
wo
nt
suppose
mrs
roberts
mrs
roberts
at
the
same
time
you
must
nt
regard
it
indeed
mr
westgate
mrs
campbell
mrs
campbell
at
the
same
campbell
campbell
at
the
same
time
roberts
is
all
absence
of
mind
westgate
westgate
ha
ha
ha
but
you
know
ah
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
i
see
capital
oh
excellent
english
word
for
checks
excellent
ah
would
you
be
good
enough
to
say
just
what
you
mean
by
painting
a
place
red
campbell
campbell
roberts
will
show
you
if
you
ll
only
stay
westgate
westgate
it
s
quite
impossible
now
at
all
events
to
roberts
but
the
letter
you
kindly
gave
me
to
your
uncle
roberts
roberts
yes
yes
mrs
roberts
mrs
roberts
you
ll
like
uncle
philip
so
much
and
he
ll
appreciate
the
favor
edward
s
done
him
in
sending
mrs
campbell
mrs
campbell
at
the
same
time
he
s
so
fond
of
the
english
and
he
s
right
on
to
roberts
s
jokes
they
re
always
at
it
together
back
and
forth
all
the
time
if
roberts
has
put
up
any
little
job
uncle
phil
will
catch
on
like
lightning
westgate
westgate
oh
what
extremely
delightful
expressions
i
m
sure
i
sha
nt
remember
the
half
of
them
but
this
letter
do
you
really
think
he
takes
it
from
his
pocket
roberts
roberts
yes
yes
i
m
quite
certain
he
ll
mrs
roberts
mrs
roberts
at
the
same
time
oh
yes
indeed
my
husband
was
with
him
so
much
at
one
time
they
re
almost
of
the
same
age
westgate
westgate
oh
indeed
i
fancied
an
old
gentleman
then
you
think
that
he
ll
understand
mrs
campbell
mrs
campbell
uncle
philip
understands
mr
roberts
and
all
his
ways
perfectly
they
have
such
fun
when
they
re
together
time
it
does
nt
matter
what
edward
has
written
he
ll
take
it
just
in
the
right
way
campbell
campbell
at
the
same
time
yes
he
ll
know
it
s
some
kind
of
a
joke
westgate
westgate
well
you
know
i
thought
perhaps
myself
it
was
one
of
your
pieces
of
american
humor
mrs
roberts
mrs
roberts
oh
it
was
mr
westgate
i
assure
you
it
was
just
one
of
our
pieces
of
american
humor
mrs
campbell
mrs
campbell
yes
indeed
you
can
depend
upon
that
mr
westgate
westgate
westgate
ah
well
if
it
had
been
mr
campbell
here
i
should
have
felt
sure
of
it
but
i
could
nt
be
quite
so
certain
that
mr
roberts
campbell
campbell
oh
when
it
comes
to
joking
americans
are
all
alike
roberts
is
a
little
more
alike
than
the
rest
philip
for
that
matter
he
d
take
it
right
even
if
roberts
had
nt
written
anything
at
all
westgate
westgate
but
that
s
just
what
mr
roberts
has
done
all
the
others
all
the
others
what
westgate
westgate
handing
the
envelope
to
roberts
who
finds
it
empty
and
passes
it
to
his
wife
who
in
turn
hands
it
silently
to
mrs
campbell
of
course
i
wished
to
read
the
kind
things
you
d
said
of
me
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
no
letter
in
this
envelope
i
was
nt
sure
whether
you
intended
me
simply
to
present
the
envelope
to
your
uncle
or
whether
at
all
events
i
decided
i
d
better
come
and
ask
campbell
campbell
who
has
possessed
himself
of
the
envelope
why
look
here
roberts
you
put
both
letters
in
that
sealed
envelope
i
kept
mr
westgate
from
posting
in
the
fire
alarm
box
roberts
really
mr
westgate
i
do
nt
know
what
to
say
mrs
roberts
mrs
roberts
yes
edward
i
do
nt
know
what
you
will
say
campbell
campbell
roberts
you
re
incorrigible
when
will
you
give
up
this
habit
of
practical
joking
really
old
fellow
you
ought
to
stop
it
you
and
uncle
phil
have
kept
it
up
long
enough
and
i
think
you
owe
mr
westgate
an
apology
the
joke
s
on
uncle
phil
of
course
but
you
ought
to
see
that
it
s
rather
embarrassing
to
mr
westgate
to
find
himself
the
bearer
of
an
empty
envelope
instead
of
a
letter
of
introduction
come
now
you
must
explain
and
we
ll
all
apologize
for
you
roberts
waits
with
a
foolish
face
of
deprecation
turning
to
horror
at
the
suggestion
of
an
explanation
come
you
owe
it
to
yourself
as
a
joker
westgate
westgate
amiably
ow
now
not
able
to
forgive
myself
if
i
could
nt
allow
a
man
his
joke
but
i
should
like
an
explanation
you
know
your
humor
is
so
very
different
to
ours
and
i
do
nt
believe
any
one
at
home
if
i
said
you
had
given
me
an
empty
envelope
to
carry
to
your
uncle
could
feel
the
spirit
of
it
and
these
things
are
so
tiresome
you
know
when
they
happen
to
fall
flat
i
hope
you
wo
nt
think
me
importunate
if
i
say
i
should
like
to
know
just
where
the
laugh
comes
in
on
a
thing
of
that
kind
campbell
campbell
out
with
it
roberts
mrs
roberts
mrs
roberts
do
nt
you
think
oh
i
m
sure
you
ll
spoil
it
edward
mrs
campbell
mrs
campbell
do
nt
you
think
you
d
better
leave
it
to
uncle
philip
campbell
campbell
well
that
s
an
inspiration
amy
leave
it
to
uncle
should
ever
come
to
despise
myself
for
having
been
ashamed
of
him
when
when
that
i
could
nt
bear
she
drops
into
a
chair
near
the
table
and
lets
full
her
face
into
her
hands
upon
it
sobbing
mrs
bellingham
mrs
bellingham
leslie
leslie
be
yourself
how
strangely
you
act
leslie
leslie
lifting
her
face
to
let
it
gleam
a
moment
upon
her
mother
before
she
drops
it
oil
yes
i
feel
very
strangely
but
now
i
wo
nt
distress
you
any
more
mother
lifting
her
face
again
and
impetuously
drying
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
no
one
shall
ever
hear
a
murmur
from
me
not
a
murmur
i
think
that
s
due
to
you
mamma
you
have
been
so
patient
with
me
i
ve
no
right
to
grieve
you
by
going
on
in
this
silly
way
and
i
wo
nt
i
will
be
firm
firm
firm
she
casts
herself
into
her
mother
s
arms
and
as
she
hangs
upon
her
neck
in
a
passion
of
grief
mrs
murray
appears
in
the
door
way
and
in
spite
of
mrs
bellingham
s
gesticulated
entreaties
to
retire
advances
into
the
room
ii
mrs
murray
bellingham
and
leslie
mrs
murray
mrs
murray
why
what
in
the
world
does
all
this
mean
leslie
leslie
raising
her
head
and
turning
fiercely
upon
her
it
means
that
i
m
now
all
you
wish
me
to
be
quite
your
own
ideal
of
ingratitude
and
selfishness
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
success
she
vanishes
stormily
from
the
room
mrs
murray
has
she
dismissed
him
has
she
broken
with
him
bellingham
bellingham
coldly
i
think
she
meant
you
to
understand
that
mrs
murray
mrs
murray
very
well
then
charles
ca
nt
come
a
moment
too
soon
if
things
are
at
this
pass
and
leslie
s
in
this
mood
it
s
the
most
dangerous
moment
of
the
whole
affair
if
she
should
meet
him
now
everything
would
be
lost
mrs
bellingham
mrs
bellingham
do
nt
be
troubled
she
wo
nt
meet
him
he
s
gone
mrs
murray
mrs
murray
i
shall
believe
that
when
i
see
him
going
a
man
like
that
would
never
leave
her
in
the
world
because
she
bade
him
and
i
should
think
him
a
great
fool
if
he
did
v
blake
s
saving
doubt
i
leslie
and
maggie
leslie
leslie
but
it
s
all
over
it
s
all
over
another
girl
of
me
maggie
along
the
road
that
winds
near
the
nook
where
the
encounter
with
the
tramps
took
place
leslie
comes
languidly
pacing
with
her
friend
maggie
wallace
who
listens
as
they
walk
with
downcast
eyes
and
an
air
of
reverent
devotion
to
leslie
s
talk
her
voice
trembles
a
little
and
as
they
pause
a
moment
maggie
draws
leslie
s
head
down
upon
her
neck
from
which
the
latter
presently
lifts
it
fiercely
i
do
nt
wish
you
to
pity
me
maggie
for
i
do
nt
deserve
any
pity
i
m
not
suffering
an
atom
more
than
i
ought
it
s
all
my
own
fault
mamma
really
left
me
quite
free
and
if
i
cared
more
for
what
people
would
say
and
think
and
look
than
i
did
for
him
i
m
rightfully
punished
and
i
m
not
going
to
whimper
about
it
i
ve
thought
it
all
out
maggie
miss
maggie
wallace
o
leslie
you
always
did
think
and
i
hope
that
i
shall
get
my
reward
and
be
an
example
i
hope
i
shall
never
marry
at
all
or
else
some
horrid
old
thing
i
detest
it
would
serve
me
right
and
i
should
be
glad
of
it
maggie
miss
maggie
wallace
oh

no
do
nt
talk
in
that
way

come
back
with
me
to
the
house
and
lie
down
or
i
m
sure
you
ll
be
ill

perfectly
worn
out
leslie
leslie
drooping
upon
the
fallen
log
where
she
had
sat
to
sketch
the
birch
forest
yes
i
m
tired
i
think
i
shall
never
be
rested
again
it
s
the
same
place
looking
wistfully
round
and
yet
how
strange
it
seems
you
know
we
used
to
come
here
and
sit
on
this
log
and
talk
what
long
long
talks
oh
me
it
will
never
be
again
how
weird
those
birches
look
like
well
well
it

all
over

to
the
house

time

maggie
miss
maggie
wallace
o
leslie
i
hate
to
leave
you

such
a
dreadful
place
leslie
leslie
after
what

happened
it
s
a
sacred
place
the
dearest
place
in
the
world
to
me
come
maggie
you
must
nt
break
your
appointment
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
with
me
at
all
and
now
you
must
go
say
that
you
left
me
behind
a
little
way
that
i
ll
be
there
directly
maggie
miss
maggie
wallace
leslie
leslie
leslie
maggie
they
embrace
tenderly
on
her
way
while
leslie
sits
staring
absently
at
the
birches
she
remains
in
this
dreary
reverie
till
she
is
startled
by
a
footfall
in
the
road
when
she
rises
in
a
sudden
panic
blake
listlessly
advances
toward
her
at
the
sight
of
her
he
halts
and
they
both
stand
silently
regarding
each
other
ii
leslie
and
blake
leslie
leslie
oh
you
said
you
were
going
away
blake
blake
are
you
in
such
haste
to
have
me
gone
i
had
to
wait
for
the
afternoon
stage
i
could
nt
walk
i
thought
i
might
keep
faith
with
you
by
staying
away
from
the
house
till
it
was
time
to
start
leslie
leslie
precipitatel
y
do
you
call
that
keeping
faith
with
me
is
leaving
me
all
alone
keeping
oh
yes
yes
it
is
you
have
done
right
it
s
i
who
ca
nt
keep
faith
with
myself
why
bad
as
that
then
you
want
my
approval
hartley
no
neither
your
help
that
was
mrs
roycroft
tolboy
i
knew
it
but
i
thought
i
would
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
what
s
she
been
doing
now
hartley
oh
my
dear
fellow
she
s
been
stealing
stealing
from
planet
brothers
he
waves
his
hand
nervelessly
toward
the
desk
where
the
bends
over
it
whistling
softly
and
it
s
happened
so
that
the
suspicion
may
fall
upon
poor
young
charles
lannard
but
i
must
say
that
as
soon
as
she
realized
that
she
was
horror
stricken
and
she
s
rushed
out
to
take
the
blame
on
herself
she
s
gone
to
the
planets
to
confess
to
tell
the
detectives
and
take
the
consequence
i
could
nt
stop
her
tolboy
listens
with
dismay
that
passes
into
something
different
when
hartley
concludes
she
said
she
would
manage
them
tolboy
i
ve
no
doubt
she
ll
try
it
he
smiles
not
quite
cheerfully
but
what
s
lannard
got
to
do
with
it
where
does
he
come
in
hartley
she
says
he
was
at
the
same
showcase
looking
at
rings
i
suppose
he
was
looking
at
wedding
rings
he
s
to
be
married
next
week
tolboy
did
she
seem
to
have
known
that
hartley
i
ca
nt
say
but
what
do
you
mean
tolboy
and
then
was
sorry
for
it
hartley
how
do
i
know
why
should
she
have
taken
the
things
tolboy
why
should
she
have
left
them
here
if
she
was
going
back
to
restore
them
and
give
herself
up
hartley
in
despair
i
did
nt
think
of
that
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
tolboy
you
ought
to
have
stopped
her
going
till
you
could
think
it
over
hartley
i
did
try
but
she
escaped
tolboy
well
i
do
nt
see
what
you
can
do
now
except
wait
developments
poor
old
roycroft
i
do
nt
envy
him
his
job
hartley
tolboy
i
do
nt
like
the
tone
you
take
i
know
that
you
think
lightly
of
mrs
roycroft
and
i
ll
own
myself
that
i
have
no
great
but
this
is
a
serious
matter
it
does
nt
involve
her
alone
it
involves
lannard
tolboy
i
should
think
lannard
was
out
of
it
unless
she
repents
of
repenting
s
practising
in
there
he
nods
toward
the
door
giving
into
the
church
hartley
it
s
lamm
our
new
organist
but
tolboy
listening
rather
nice
is
nt
it
hartley
yes
i
do
nt
know
i
suppose
so
but
tolboy
if
lannard
tolboy
recurring
to
him
from
the
music
what
sort
of
fellow
is
lannard
hartley
he
s
a
noble
fellow
he
s
his
father
all
over
again
tolboy
and
a
little
more
i
always
suspect
your
noble
fellows
you
know
but
i
had
nt
seen
lannard
for
some
time
before
i
went
abroad
and
he
may
be
all
right
in
spite
of
you
who
s
he
going
to
marry
hartley
the
finest
girl
in
the
world
margaret
wilson
tolboy
nettie
devoe
s
daughter
hartley
yes
and
she
s
as
like
her
mother
as
he
is
like
his
father
they
a
knock
at
the
street
entrance
arrests
him
tolboy
escaping
toward
back
to
say
she
ca
nt
find
sherlock
holmes
hartley
seizing
tolboy
you
must
nt
go
tolboy
i
ca
nt
let
you
i
need
you
come
in
he
releases
tolboy
at
sight
of
charles
lannard
and
taking
the
young
man
s
hand
affectionately
turns
with
him
toward
tolboy
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
my
dear
charles
the
young
man
is
very
pale
and
his
eyes
are
wild
under
his
disordered
hair
he
is
a
slender
youth
in
the
early
twenties
with
a
delicate
clean
shaven
face
you
know
doctor
tolboy
lannard
laxly
and
inatttentively
shaking
hands
oh
yes
i
thought
you
were
nt
back
yet
how
do
you
do
ah
he
catches
sight
of
the
jewelry
on
hartley
s
desk
then
she
did
she
did
i
was
praying
she
had
nt
i
was
hoping
i
had
dreamed
it
hartley
it
s
no
dream
my
poor
boy
but
it
been
telling
doctor
tolboy
we
can
speak
freely
before
him
he
s
an
old
friend
of
mr
roycroft
s
you
know
lannard
without
heeding
where
is
she
hartley
she
s
gone
to
planets
she
came
here
and
told
me
everything
and
i
advised
her
to
make
confession
and
restitution
as
the
only
means
of
diverting
suspicion
from
you
lannard
from
me
hartley
you
were
at
the
same
show
case
buying
a
ring
lannard
my
wedding
ring
yes
hartley
and
as
soon
as
these
things
are
missed
the
suspicion
must
fall
either
on
her
or
on
you
lannard
i
see
he
realizes
the
fact
with
visible
horror
and
she
s
gone
to
say
she
stole
them
after
another
moment
but
she
must
nt
you
ought
nt
to
have
let
her
mr
hartley
think
of
her
family
her
little
children
oh
i
ca
nt
allow
it
i
will
go
and
take
the
blame
myself
i
will
bear
me
out
tolboy
who
has
been
regarding
him
with
a
smile
of
scientific
interest
but
why
should
you
do
that
lannard
with
exaltation
why
should
nt
i
do
it
i
am
a
man
and
she
is
a
woman
she
is
a
wife
and
it
will
break
her
husband
s
heart
she
is
a
mother
and
her
motherhood
makes
her
sacred
tolboy
thoughtfully
yes
i
know
there
is
that
view
of
it
lannard
fiercely
is
there
any
other
tolboy
i
was
merely
wondering
whether
her
husband
s
fatherhood
made
him
sacred
lannard
indignantly
the
holiest
things
can
be
turned
into
ridicule
hartley
no
no
my
dear
charles
i
m
sure
tolboy
does
nt
mean
anything
of
that
kind
i
m
sure
he
ll
help
us
if
he
can
tolboy
i
m
afraid
i
ca
nt
hartley
on
the
lines
proposed
but
it
seems
to
me
it
s
the
other
way
about
motherhood
does
that
makes
motherhood
sacred
just
as
a
man
makes
fatherhood
sacred
if
he
is
good

of
a
sleeping
car
on

boston

the

a

slender
and
pretty
with

asleep
on
the

beside
her
and
a
stout
old
lady
sit
confronting
each

mrs

and
her
aunt
mary
mrs
roberts
do
you
always
take
down
your
back
hair
aunty
aunt
mary
no
never
child
at
least
not
since
i
had
such
a
fright
about
it
once
coming
on
from
new
york
it
s
all
well
enough
to
take
down
your
back
hair
if
it
is
yours
but
if
it
is
nt
your
as
i
buy
mine
of
madame
pierrot
mrs
roberts
do
nt
you
wish
she
would
nt
advertise
it
as
human
hair
it
sounds
so
pokerish
like
human
flesh
you
know
aunt
mary
why
she
could
nt
call
it
inhuman
hair
my
dear
mrs
roberts
thoughtfully
no
just
hair
aunt
mary
then
people
might
think
it
was
for
mattresses
but
as
i
was
saying
i
took
it
off
that
night
and
tucked
it
safely
away
as
i
supposed
in
my
pocket
and
i
slept
sweetly
till
about
midnight
when
i
happened
to
open
my
eyes
and
saw
something
long
and
black
crawl
off
my
bed
and
slip
under
the
berth
such
a
shriek
as
i
gave
my
dear
a
snake
a
snake
oh
a
snake
and
everybody
began
talking
at
once
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
swearing
and
the
porter
came
running
with
the
poker
to
kill
it
and
all
the
while
it
was
of
my
pocket
and
glad
enough
i
was
to
grab
it
up
before
anybody
saw
it
and
say
i
must
have
been
dreaming
mrs
roberts
why
aunty
how
funny
how
could
you
suppose
a
serpent
could
get
on
board
a
sleeping
car
of
all
places
in
the
world
aunt
mary
that
was
the
perfect
absurdity
of
it
the
porter
berths
ready
now
ladies
mrs
roberts
to
the
porter
who
walks
away
to
the
end
of
the
car
and
sits
down
near
the
door
oh
thank
you
aunty
do
you
feel
nervous
the
least
bit
aunt
mary
nervous
no
why
mrs
roberts
well
i
do
nt
know
i
suppose
i
ve
been
worked
up
a
little
about
meeting
willis
and
wondering
how
he
ll
look
and
all
we
ca
nt
know
each
other
of
course
it
does
nt
stand
to
reason
that
if
he
s
been
out
there
for
twelve
years
ever
since
i
at
least
i
have
that
he
could
recognize
me
not
at
the
first
glance
you
know
he
ll
have
a
full
beard
and
then
i
ve
got
married
and
here
s
the
baby
oh
no
he
ll
never
guess
who
it
is
in
the
world
photographs
really
amount
to
nothing
in
such
a
case
i
wish
we
were
at
home
and
it
was
all
over
i
wish
he
had
written
some
particulars
instead
of
telegraphing
from
ogden
be
with
you
on
the
a
m
wednesday
aunt
mary
californians
always
telegraph
my
dear
they
never
think
of
writing
it
is
nt
expensive
enough
and
it
does
nt
make
your
blood
run
cold
enough
to
get
a
letter
and
so
they
send
you
one
of
those
miserable
yellow
despatches
whenever
they
can
those
printed
in
a
long
string
if
possible
so
that
you
ll
be
sure
to
die
before
you
get
to
the
end
of
it
i
suppose
your
brother
has
fallen
into
ornary
and
which
the
same
just
like
one
of
mr
bret
harte
s
characters
mrs
roberts
but
it
is
nt
exactly
our
not
knowing
each
other
aunty
that
s
worrying
me
that
s
something
that
could
be
got
over
in
time
what
is
simply
driving
me
distracted
is
willis
and
edward
meeting
there
when
i
m
away
from
home
oh
how
could
i
be
away
and
why
could
nt
willis
have
given
us
fair
warning
i
would
have
hurried
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
meet
him
i
do
nt
believe
poor
edward
ever
saw
a
californian
and
he
s
so
quiet
and
pre
occupied
i
m
sure
he
d
never
get
on
with
willis
and
if
willis
is
the
least
loud
he
would
nt
like
edward
not
that
i
suppose
he
is
loud
but
i
do
nt
believe
he
knows
anything
about
literary
men
but
you
can
see
aunty
ca
nt
you
how
very
anxious
i
must
be
do
nt
you
see
edward
met
so
as
to
to
well
to
break
them
to
each
other
do
nt
you
know
aunt
mary
oh
you
need
nt
be
troubled
about
that
agnes
i
dare
say
they
ve
got
on
perfectly
well
together
very
likely
they
re
sitting
down
to
the
unwholesomest
hot
supper
this
instant
that
the
ingenuity
of
man
could
invent
mrs
roberts
oh
do
you
think
they
are
aunty
oh
if
i
could
only
believe
they
were
sitting
down
to
a
hot
supper
together
now
i
should
be
so
happy
they
d
be
sure
to
get
on
if
they
were
there
s
nothing
like
eating
to
make
men
friendly
with
each
other
do
nt
you
know
at
receptions
how
they
never
have
anything
to
say
to
each
other
till
the
escalloped
oysters
and
the
chicken
salad
appear
and
then
how
sweet
they
are
as
soon
as
they
ve
helped
the
ladies
to
ice
oh
thank
you
thank
you
aunty
for
thinking
of
the
mind
you
can
understand
ca
nt
you
aunty
dear
how
anxious
i
must
have
been
to
have
my
only
brother
and
my
only
my
husband
get
on
nicely
together
my
life
would
be
a
wreck
simply
a
wreck
if
they
did
nt
and
willis
and
i
not
having
seen
each
other
since
and
through
the
investigations
of
father
fairfield
the
eloquent
s
life
in
england
and
scotland
as
i
have
given
it
to
you
i
received
father
fairfield
s
letter
only
this
day
only
this
day
i
have
learned
salome
that
you
are
really
the
duchess
of
hereward
that
the
duke
of
hereward
was
and
is
really
your
husband
and
was
never
the
husband
of
any
other
woman
oh
how
bitterly
how
bitterly
how
unpardonably
i
have
wronged
him
he
will
pardon
me
yes
he
will
for
he
is
all
magnanimity
and
he
loves
me
but
i
can
never
never
pardon
myself
exclaimed
the
young
wife
her
first
joy
at
discovering
the
absolute
integrity
of
her
husband
now
giving
place
to
the
severest
self
condemnation
you
need
not
reproach
yourself
so
cruelly
so
sternly
under
circumstances
in
which
you
would
not
reproach
another
at
all
remember
what
you
told
me
you
had
the
evidence
of
your
own
eyes
and
ears
and
the
testimony
of
documents
and
of
individuals
against
him
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
and
ears
which
mistook
the
counterfeit
for
the
real
the
testimony
of
documents
that
were
forgeries
and
of
individuals
that
were
false
and
upon
these
i
believed
my
noble
husband
guilty
of
a
felony
and
without
even
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
explain
the
circumstances
or
to
defend
himself
i
left
him
even
on
our
wedding
day
and
have
concealed
myself
from
him
for
many
months
exposing
him
to
misconstruction
to
dishonor
and
reproach
oh
no
i
can
never
never
pardon
myself
nor
do
i
even
know
how
he
can
ever
pardon
me
but
he
will
i
am
sure
he
will
even
as
the
lord
pardons
all
repented
sin
however
grievous
so
will
my
peerless
husband
pardon
me
fervently
exclaimed
salome
the
abbess
reverted
to
her
own
troubles
i
can
not
understand
she
said
the
mystery
of
that
man
s
appearance
here
this
morning
what
man
inquired
salome
who
was
nearly
forgotten
the
existence
of
other
men
what
man
why
daughter
the
count
waldemar
de
volaski
the
man
who
came
here
with
the
woman
this
morning
the
man
whom
you
mistook
for
your
own
husband
the
duke
of
hereward
but
whom
i
knew
to
be
waldemar
de
volaski
once
my
betrothed
who
was
said
to
have
been
killed
in
a
duel
shot
through
the
heart
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
answered
the
lady
emphatically
salome
stared
at
the
abbess
for
a
few
moments
in
amazed
silence
and
then
exclaimed
dear
madam
good
mother
are
you
still
under
that
deep
delusion
delusion
echoed
the
lady
yes
the
deepest
delusion
dear
lady
do
you
not
know
can
you
not
comprehend
now
that
the
man
who
visited
us
this
morning
was
no
other
than
john
scott
the
counterpart
whom
even
i
really
did
mistake
for
the
duke
of
hereward
as
you
say
and
that
the
bold
bad
beauty
nay
daughter
he
was
count
waldemar
de
volaski
persisted
the
abbess
what
an
hallucination
dear
lady
do
you
not
see
but
what
is
the
use
of
talking
i
can
not
convince
you
of
your
mistake
but
circumstances
may
for
of
course
sooner
or
later
the
unhappy
man
will
be
arrested
and
brought
to
trial
for
his
share
in
the
robbery
and
murder
at
castle
lone
no
you
can
not
convince
me
of
mistake
because
i
have
not
made
any
but
i
will
convince
you
of
yours
said
the
lady
rising
and
striking
a
match
and
lighting
a
lamp
for
they
had
hitherto
sat
in
darkness
salome
smiled
incredulously
the
abbess
went
to
a
little
drawer
of
the
stand
upon
which
her
crucifix
and
missal
stood
and
drew
from
it
a
small
box
which
she
opened
and
exhibited
to
salome
saying
this
daughter
is
the
only
memento
of
the
world
and
the
world
s
people
that
i
have
retained
that
it
is
the
likeness
of
my
once
betrothed
bestowed
on
me
on
the
occasion
of
our
betrothal
cherished
once
in
loyal
love
cherished
now
in
prayerful
memory
of
one
whom
i
supposed
had
expiated
his
sins
by
death
long
long
ago
i
have
kept
it
but
i
have
not
looked
at
it
for
twenty
years
or
more
salome
took
the
miniature
and
examined
it
carefully
with
interest
and
curiosity
it
was
very
well
painted
in
water
colors
on
ivory
it
represented
a
young
man
of
from
twenty
to
twenty
five
years
of
age
with
a
roman
profile
fair
complexion
blue
eyes
and
blonde
hair
and
mustache
and
so
far
as
these
features
and
this
complexion
went
the
miniature
certainly
did
bear
an
external
and
superficial
resemblance
to
john
scott
and
to
the
young
duke
of
hereward
but
in
character
and
expression
the
faces
were
so
totally
different
that
salome
could
never
have
mistaken
the
miniature
to
be
a
likeness
of
the
duke
or
his
brother
or
either
of
these
men
to
be
the
miniature
for
a
few
minutes
she
turned
to
the
abbess
and
said
you
tell
me
that
you
have
not
looked
at
this
for
twenty
years
i
have
not
said
the
lady
and
you
tell
me
that
the
man
who
visited
the
asylum
this
morning
is
the
original
of
this
picture
i
do
then
dear
mother
your
memory
is
at
fault
and
your
imagination
deceives
and
misleads
you
both
the
supposed
original
and
the
miniature
are
thin
faced
with
roman
features
fair
complexion
blue
eyes
and
blonde
hair
points
of
resemblance
which
are
common
to
many
men
who
are
not
at
all
alike
in
any
other
respect
now
look
at
this
miniature
again
and
you
will
see
that
except
in
the
points
i
have
named
it
is
in
no
way
like
the
man
you
mistook
for
its
original
i
would
rather
not
look
at
it
i
have
not
seen
it
since
volaski
s
supposed
death
said
the
abbess
shrinking
oh
mind
you
see
so
few
men
that
you
may
easily
mistake
one
blonde
for
another
after
twenty
years
of
absence
from
them
persisted
salome
pressing
the
open
miniature
upon
and
cortlandt
approached
to
examine
it
more
closely
you
see
said
cortlandt
this
vertebrate
for
that
is
as
definitely
as
we
can
yet
describe
it
forces
a
great
pressure
of
air
into
its
head
and
it
must
allow
to
rush
into
its
very
rudimentary
lower
extremities
distending
them
with
such
violence
that
the
body
is
shot
upward
and
forward
you
may
have
noticed
the
tightly
inflated
portion
underneath
as
they
left
the
ground
while
speaking
he
had
moved
rather
near
when
suddenly
a
partially
concealed
mouth
opened
showing
the
unmistakable
tongue
and
fangs
of
a
serpent
it
emitted
a
hissing
sound
and
the
small
eyes
gleamed
maliciously
do
you
believe
it
is
a
poisonous
species
asked
ayrault
i
suspect
it
is
replied
the
doctor
for
though
it
is
doubtless
able
to
leap
with
great
accuracy
upon
its
prey
we
saw
it
took
some
time
to
recharge
the
upper
air
chamber
so
that
were
it
not
armed
with
poison
glands
it
would
fall
an
easy
victim
to
its
more
powerful
and
swifter
contemporaries
and
would
soon
become
extinct
as
it
will
be
unable
to
spring
for
some
time
said
bearwarden
we
might
as
well
save
it
the
shell
from
his
rifle
he
fired
an
explosive
ball
into
the
reptile
whereupon
about
half
the
body
disappeared
while
a
sickening
odour
arose
although
the
sun
was
still
far
above
the
horizon
the
rapidity
with
which
it
was
descending
showed
that
the
short
night
of
less
than
five
hours
would
soon
be
upon
them
and
though
short
it
might
be
very
dark
for
they
were
in
the
tropics
and
the
sun
going
down
perpendicularly
must
also
pass
completely
around
the
globe
instead
of
as
in
northern
latitudes
on
earth
in
summer
approaching
the
horizon
obliquely
and
not
going
far
below
it
a
slight
and
diffused
sound
here
seemed
to
rise
from
the
ground
all
about
them
for
which
they
could
not
account
presently
it
became
louder
and
as
the
sun
touched
the
horizon
it
poured
forth
in
prolonged
strains
the
large
trumpet
shaped
lilies
reeds
and
heliotropes
seemed
fairly
to
throb
as
they
raised
their
anthem
to
the
sky
and
the
setting
sun
while
the
air
grew
dark
with
until
as
the
chorus
grew
fainter
and
gradually
ceased
they
flew
back
to
their
nests
the
three
companions
had
stood
astonished
while
this
act
was
played
the
doctor
then
spoke
this
is
the
most
marvellous
development
of
nature
i
have
seen
for
its
wonderful
divergence
from
and
yet
analogy
to
what
takes
place
on
earth
you
know
our
flowers
offer
honey
as
it
were
as
bait
to
insects
that
in
eating
or
collecting
it
they
may
catch
the
pollen
on
their
legs
and
so
carry
it
to
other
flowers
perhaps
of
the
opposite
sex
here
flowers
evidently
appeal
to
the
sense
of
hearing
instead
of
taste
and
make
use
of
birds
of
which
there
are
enormous
numbers
instead
of
winged
insects
of
which
i
have
seen
none
one
being
perhaps
the
natural
result
of
the
other
the
flowers
have
become
singers
by
long
practice
or
else
those
that
were
most
musical
having
had
the
best
chance
to
reproduce
we
have
a
neat
illustration
of
the
survival
by
a
shrinking
of
the
fibres
as
the
sun
withdraws
its
heat
in
which
case
we
may
expect
another
song
at
sunrise
when
the
same
result
will
be
effected
by
their
expanding
searching
for
a
camping
place
in
which
to
pass
the
coming
hours
they
saw
lights
flitting
about
like
will
o
the
wisps
but
brighter
and
intermittent
they
seem
to
be
as
bright
as
sixteen
candle
power
lamps
but
the
light
is
yellower
and
appears
to
emanate
from
a
comparatively
large
surface
certainly
nine
or
ten
inches
square
said
the
doctor
they
soon
gave
up
the
chase
however
for
the
lights
were
continually
moving
and
frequently
went
out
while
groping
in
the
growing
darkness
they
came
upon
a
brown
object
about
the
size
of
a
small
dog
and
close
to
the
ground
it
flew
off
with
a
humming
insect
sound
and
as
it
did
so
it
showed
the
brilliant
phosphorescent
glow
they
had
observed
that
is
a
good
sized
fire
fly
said
bearwarden
evidently
the
insects
here
are
on
the
fire
flies
in
cuba
which
the
cubans
are
said
to
put
into
a
glass
box
and
get
light
enough
from
to
read
by
here
they
would
need
only
one
if
it
could
be
induced
to
give
its
light
continuously
having
found
an
open
space
on
high
ground
they
sat
down
and
bearwarden
struck
his
repeater
which
for
convenience
had
been
arranged
for
jupiter
time
dividing
the
day
into
ten
hours
beginning
at
noon
midnight
being
therefore
five
o
clock
twenty
minutes
past
four
said
he
which
would
correspond
to
about
a
quarter
to
eleven
on
earth
as
the
sun
rises
at
half
past
seven
it
will
be
dark
about
three
hours
for
the
time
between
dawn
and
daylight
will
of
course
be
as
short
as
that
we
have
just
experienced
between
sunset
and
night
if
we
stay
here
long
said
the
doctor
i
suppose
we
shall
become
accustomed
like
sailors
to
taking
our
four
or
in
this
case
five
or
added
ayrault
we
can
sleep
ten
consecutive
hours
and
take
the
next
ten
for
exploring
and
hunting
having
the
sun
for
one
half
the
time
and
the
moons
for
the
other
bearwarden
and
cortlandt
now
rolled
themselves
in
their
blankets
and
were
soon
asleep
while
ayrault
whose
turn
it
was
to
watch
till
the
moons
rose
for
they
had
not
yet
enough
confidence
in
their
new
domain
to
sleep
in
darkness
simultaneously
leaned
his
back
against
a
rock
and
lighted
his
pipe
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
torrents
of
fiery
lava
from
the
volcanoes
reflected
in
the
sky
and
faintly
heard
their
thunderous
crashes
while
the
fire
flies
twinkled
unconcernedly
in
the
hollow
and
the
night
winds
swayed
the
fernlike
branches
then
he
gazed
at
the
earth
which
but
little
above
the
horizon
shone
with
a
faint
the
new
life
this
large
explanation
may
not
account
for
the
summer
restlessness
that
overtakes
nearly
everybody
we
are
the
annual
victims
of
the
delusion
that
there
exists
somewhere
the
ideal
spot
where
manners
are
simple
and
milk
is
pure
and
lodging
is
cheap
where
we
shall
fall
at
once
into
content
we
never
do
for
content
consists
not
in
having
all
we
want
nor
in
not
wanting
everything
but
in
not
wanting
that
we
can
get
in
our
summer
flittings
we
carry
our
wants
with
us
to
places
where
they
can
not
be
gratified
a
few
people
have
discovered
that
repose
can
be
had
at
home
but
this
discovery
is
too
unfashionable
to
find
favor
we
have
no
rest
except
in
moving
about
looked
at
superficially
it
seems
curious
that
the
american
is
as
a
rule
the
only
person
who
does
not
emigrate
the
fact
is
that
he
can
go
nowhere
else
where
life
is
so
uneasy
and
where
consequently
he
would
have
so
little
of
his
sort
of
repose
to
put
him
in
another
country
would
be
like
putting
a
nineteenth
century
man
back
into
the
eighteenth
century
the
american
wants
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
procession
as
he
fancies
he
is
where
he
can
hear
the
band
play
and
be
the
first
to
see
the
fireworks
of
the
new
era
he
thinks
that
he
occupies
an
advanced
station
of
observation
from
which
his
telescope
can
reason
he
thinks
so
for
not
seldom
he
takes
up
a
foreign
idea
and
tires
of
it
before
it
is
current
elsewhere
more
than
one
great
writer
of
england
had
his
first
popular
recognition
in
america
even
this
season
the
saturday
review
is
struggling
with
ibsen
while
boston
having
had
that
disease
has
probably
gone
on
to
some
other
fad
far
be
it
from
us
to
praise
the
american
for
his
lack
of
repose
it
is
enough
to
attempt
to
account
for
it
but
from
the
social
or
rather
society
point
of
view
the
subject
has
a
disquieting
aspect
if
the
american
young
man
and
young
woman
get
it
into
their
heads
that
repose
especially
of
manner
is
the
correct
thing
they
will
go
in
for
it
in
a
way
to
astonish
the
world
the
late
cultivation
of
idiocy
by
the
american
dude
was
unique
he
carried
it
to
an
extreme
impossible
to
the
youth
of
any
nation
less
gifted
and
if
the
american
girl
goes
in
seriously
for
to
any
modern
languidity
or
to
any
ancient
marble
if
what
is
wanted
in
society
is
cold
hauteur
and
languid
superciliousness
or
lofty
immobility
we
are
confident
that
with
a
little
practice
she
can
sit
stiller
and
look
more
impassive
and
move
with
less
motion
than
any
other
created
woman
we
have
that
confidence
in
her
ability
and
adaptability
it
is
a
question
whether
it
is
worth
while
to
do
this
to
sacrifice
the
vivacity
and
charm
native
to
her
and
the
natural
impulsiveness
and
generous
gift
of
herself
which
belong
to
a
new
race
in
a
new
land
which
is
walking
always
towards
the
sunrise
in
fine
although
so
much
is
said
of
the
american
lack
of
repose
is
it
not
best
for
the
american
to
be
content
to
be
himself
and
let
the
critics
adapt
themselves
or
not
as
they
choose
to
a
new
phenomenon
let
us
stick
a
philosophic
name
to
it
and
call
it
repose
in
activity
the
american
might
take
the
candid
advice
given
by
one
friend
to
get
into
the
right
frame
of
mind
the
best
thing
you
can
do
he
said
is
to
frame
your
mind
and
hang
it
up
women
ideal
and
real
we
have
not
by
any
means
got
to
the
bottom
of
realism
it
matters
very
little
what
the
novelists
and
critics
say
about
it
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
not
the
attitude
of
society
towards
it
is
the
important
thing
even
if
the
critic
could
prove
that
nature
and
art
are
the
same
thing
and
that
the
fiction
which
is
real
is
only
a
copy
of
nature
or
if
another
should
prove
that
reality
is
only
to
be
found
in
the
ideal
little
would
be
gained
literature
is
well
enough
in
its
place
art
is
an
agreeable
pastime
and
it
is
right
that
society
should
take
up
either
in
seasons
when
lawn
tennis
and
polo
are
impracticable
and
afternoon
teas
become
flavorless
but
the
question
that
society
is
or
should
be
interested
in
is
whether
the
young
woman
of
the
future
is
going
to
shape
herself
by
a
realistic
or
an
ideal
standard
it
should
be
said
in
parenthesis
that
the
young
woman
of
the
passing
period
has
inclined
towards
realism
in
manner
and
speech
if
not
in
dress
affecting
a
sort
of
frank
return
to
the
easy
going
ways
of
nature
itself
even
to
the
adoption
of
the
language
of
the
stock
exchange
the
race
course
and
the
clubs
an
offering
of
herself
on
the
altar
of
good
fellowship
with
the
view
no
doubt
of
making
life
more
agreeable
to
the
opposite
sex
forgetting
the
fact
that
men
fall
in
love
always
or
used
to
in
the
days
when
they
could
afford
that
luxury
with
an
ideal
woman
or
if
not
with
an
ideal
woman
with
one
whom
they
idealize
and
at
this
same
time
the
world
is
full
of
doubts
and
questionings
as
to
whether
marriage
is
a
failure
have
these
questionings
anything
to
do
with
the
increasing
realism
of
women
and
a
consequent
loss
of
ideals
of
course
the
reader
sees
that
the
be
estimated
as
a
work
of
nature
or
of
art
and
here
comes
in
the
everlasting
question
of
what
is
the
highest
beauty
and
what
is
most
to
be
desired
the
greek
artists
it
seems
to
be
well
established
never
used
a
model
as
our
artists
almost
invariably
do
in
their
plastic
and
pictorial
creations
the
antique
greek
statues
or
their
copies
which
give
us
the
highest
conceptions
of
feminine
charm
and
besprinkled
with
sand
the
novelty
of
the
situation
the
beauty
of
the
sand
wreaths
the
intoxication
of
the
air
the
vivid
brilliancy
of
the
sun
and
the
sky
delighted
caius
the
blue
of
heaven
rounded
the
sandscape
to
their
present
sight
a
dome
of
blue
flame
over
a
plain
whose
colour
was
like
that
of
an
autumn
leaf
become
sear
caius
in
his
exhilaration
either
the
prospect
was
too
common
to
o
shea
to
excite
his
interest
or
the
enterprise
he
meditated
burdened
his
mind
he
gave
few
words
in
answer
and
soon
they
too
relapsed
into
the
silence
that
the
boy
and
the
pony
had
all
the
time
observed
an
hour
s
walk
and
another
sound
rang
in
their
ears
beside
the
whistling
of
the
wind
low
at
first
and
fitful
louder
and
louder
till
the
roar
of
the
surf
was
deafening
then
they
came
to
the
brink
and
heard
all
the
notes
of
which
the
chords
of
its
more
distant
music
had
been
composed
the
gasping
sob
of
the
under
tow
the
rush
of
the
lifting
wave
as
it
upreared
itself
high
the
silken
break
of
its
foam
the
crash
of
drums
with
which
it
fell
the
dash
of
wave
against
wave
and
the
cry
of
the
foremost
waves
that
bemoaned
themselves
prostrate
upon
the
beach
the
cart
with
its
little
company
turned
into
the
narrow
strip
of
dark
damp
sand
that
the
tide
firmer
and
the
wind
struck
them
obliquely
the
hardy
pony
broke
into
its
natural
pace
a
moderate
trot
in
spite
of
this
pace
the
progress
they
made
was
not
very
swift
and
it
was
already
four
by
the
clock
o
shea
climbed
to
his
place
on
the
front
of
the
cart
the
boy
sprang
down
and
ran
to
warm
himself
clapping
his
gloved
hands
as
he
ran
it
was
not
long
before
caius
clambered
into
his
straw
seat
again
and
sitting
watched
the
wonder
of
the
waves
so
level
was
the
beach
so
high
was
the
surf
that
from
the
low
cart
it
seemed
that
gigantic
monsters
were
constantly
arising
from
the
sea
and
just
as
the
fear
of
them
overshadowed
the
fascinated
mind
they
melted
away
again
into
nothingness
as
he
looked
at
the
waves
he
saw
that
their
water
mixed
with
sand
was
a
yellowish
brown
and
dark
almost
to
black
when
the
curling
top
yawned
before
the
downfall
but
so
fast
did
each
wave
break
one
glimpses
and
boiling
fields
of
foam
and
high
crests
of
foam
were
the
main
substance
of
all
that
was
to
be
seen
for
a
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
proceeding
thus
they
soon
came
to
what
was
actually
the
end
of
the
island
and
were
on
the
narrow
ridge
of
sand
dunes
which
extended
a
distance
of
some
twenty
miles
to
the
next
island
the
sand
hills
rising
sheer
from
the
shore
fifty
sixty
or
a
hundred
feet
in
height
bordered
their
road
on
the
right
to
avoid
the
soft
dry
sand
of
their
base
the
pony
often
trotted
in
the
shallow
flow
of
the
foam
which
even
yet
now
and
then
crept
over
all
the
damp
beach
to
the
high
water
mark
the
wind
was
like
spur
and
lash
the
horse
fled
before
it
eyes
and
ears
grew
accustomed
even
to
the
threatening
of
the
sea
monsters
the
sun
of
the
november
afternoon
sank
nearer
and
nearer
the
level
of
sand
and
foam
they
could
not
see
the
ocean
beyond
the
foam
when
it
grew
large
and
red
red
gold
appeared
round
it
lying
where
the
edge
of
the
sea
must
be
like
the
islands
of
the
blessed
when
the
crests
of
the
breakers
near
and
far
began
to
be
touched
with
a
fiery
glow
when
the
soft
dun
brown
of
the
sand
hills
turned
to
gold
caius
overcome
with
having
walked
and
eaten
much
and
drunk
deeply
of
the
wine
of
the
wild
salt
wind
fell
into
a
heavy
dreamless
slumber
lying
outstretched
upon
his
bed
of
straw
chapter
iv
where
the
devil
lived
caius
did
not
know
how
long
he
slept
he
woke
with
a
sudden
start
and
a
presentiment
of
evil
it
was
quite
dark
as
black
as
starlight
night
could
be
for
the
foam
of
the
waves
hardly
glimmered
to
sight
except
here
and
there
where
some
phosphorescent
jelly
was
tossed
among
them
like
a
blue
death
light
what
had
wakened
caius
was
the
sound
of
voices
talking
ahead
of
the
cart
and
the
jerk
of
the
cart
as
it
was
evidently
being
driven
off
the
he
sat
up
and
strove
to
pierce
the
darkness
by
sight
they
had
come
to
no
end
of
their
journey
the
long
beach
with
its
walls
of
foam
and
of
dune
stretched
on
without
change
but
upon
this
beach
they
were
no
longer
travelling
the
horse
was
headed
as
it
were
to
the
dune
and
now
began
to
climb
its
almost
upright
side
with
an
imprecation
he
threw
himself
out
of
the
cart
at
a
bound
into
sand
so
soft
that
he
sank
up
to
the
knees
and
stumbled
against
the
upright
side
of
the
hill
the
lower
voice
he
had
heard
was
silent
instantly
o
shea
stopped
the
pony
with
a
sharp
word
of
interrogation
where
are
you
going
shouted
caius
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
need
not
have
shouted
for
the
wind
was
swift
to
carry
all
sounds
from
his
lips
to
o
shea
but
the
latter
s
voice
as
it
came
back
to
him
seemed
to
stagger
against
the
force
of
the
wind
well
we
re
going
roight
up
towards
the
sky
at
present
but
in
a
minute
we
ll
be
going
roight
down
towards
the
other
place
if
ye
just
keep
on
at
that
side
of
the
cart
ye
ll
get
into
a
place
where
we
ll
have
a
bit
of
shelter
and
rest
till
the
moon
rises
what
is
the
matter
what
are
you
turning
off
the
road
for
caius
shouted
again
half
dazed
by
his
sleep
within
me
and
she
was
not
unreasonable
in
her
wish
to
see
the
matter
settled
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
did
not
feel
like
taking
a
bold
step
her
to
give
herself
to
me
she
ought
to
offer
me
some
reason
to
suppose
that
she
would
make
the
gift
if
i
saw
no
probability
of
such
generosity
i
would
prefer
that
things
should
remain
as
they
were
that
evening
i
was
sitting
with
madeline
in
the
moon
lit
porch
it
was
nearly
ten
o
clock
and
ever
since
supper
time
i
had
been
working
myself
up
to
the
point
of
making
an
avowal
of
my
sentiments
i
had
not
positively
determined
to
do
this
but
wished
gradually
to
reach
the
proper
point
when
if
the
prospect
looked
bright
i
might
speak
my
companion
appeared
to
understand
the
situation
at
least
i
imagined
that
the
nearer
i
came
to
a
proposal
the
more
she
seemed
to
expect
it
it
was
certainly
a
very
critical
and
important
epoch
in
my
life
if
i
spoke
i
should
make
myself
happy
or
miserable
forever
and
if
i
did
not
speak
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
lady
would
not
give
me
another
chance
to
do
and
thinking
very
hard
over
these
momentous
matters
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
ghost
not
a
dozen
feet
away
from
us
he
was
sitting
on
the
railing
of
the
porch
one
leg
thrown
up
before
him
the
other
dangling
down
as
he
leaned
against
a
post
he
was
behind
madeline
but
almost
in
front
of
me
as
i
sat
facing
the
lady
it
was
fortunate
that
madeline
was
looking
out
over
the
landscape
for
i
must
have
appeared
very
much
startled
the
ghost
had
told
me
that
he
would
see
me
sometime
this
night
but
i
did
not
think
he
would
make
his
appearance
when
i
was
in
the
company
of
madeline
if
she
should
see
the
spirit
of
her
uncle
i
could
not
answer
for
the
consequences
i
made
no
exclamation
but
the
ghost
evidently
saw
that
i
was
troubled
do
nt
be
afraid
he
said
i
shall
not
let
her
see
me
and
she
can
not
hear
me
speak
unless
i
address
myself
to
her
suppose
i
looked
grateful
so
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
the
ghost
continued
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
not
getting
along
very
well
with
your
affair
if
i
were
you
i
should
speak
out
without
waiting
any
longer
you
will
never
have
a
better
chance
you
are
not
likely
to
be
interrupted
and
so
far
as
i
can
judge
the
lady
seems
disposed
to
listen
to
you
favorably
that
is
if
she
ever
intends
to
do
so
there
is
no
knowing
when
john
hinckman
will
go
away
again
certainly
not
this
summer
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
never
dare
to
make
love
to
hinckman
s
niece
if
he
were
anywhere
about
the
place
if
he
should
catch
any
one
offering
himself
to
miss
madeline
he
would
then
be
a
terrible
man
to
encounter
i
agreed
perfectly
to
all
this
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
him
i
ejaculated
aloud
think
of
whom
asked
madeline
situation
the
long
speech
of
the
ghost
to
which
madeline
paid
no
attention
but
which
i
heard
with
perfect
distinctness
had
made
me
forget
myself
it
was
necessary
to
explain
quickly
of
course
it
would
not
do
to
admit
that
it
was
of
her
dear
uncle
that
i
was
speaking
and
so
i
mentioned
hastily
the
first
name
i
thought
of
mr
vilars
i
said
this
statement
was
entirely
correct
for
i
never
could
bear
to
think
of
mr
vilars
who
was
a
gentleman
who
had
at
various
times
paid
much
attention
to
madeline
it
is
wrong
for
you
to
speak
in
that
way
of
mr
vilars
she
said
he
is
a
remarkably
well
educated
and
sensible
young
man
and
has
very
pleasant
manners
he
expects
to
be
elected
to
the
legislature
this
fall
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
made
his
mark
he
will
do
well
in
a
legislative
body
for
whenever
mr
vilars
has
anything
to
say
he
knows
just
how
and
when
and
without
any
show
of
resentment
which
was
all
very
natural
for
if
madeline
thought
at
all
favorably
of
me
she
could
not
feel
displeased
that
i
should
have
disagreeable
emotions
in
regard
to
a
possible
rival
the
concluding
words
contained
a
hint
which
i
was
not
slow
to
understand
i
felt
very
sure
that
if
mr
vilars
were
in
my
present
position
he
would
speak
quickly
enough
i
know
it
is
wrong
to
have
such
ideas
about
a
person
i
said
but
i
can
not
help
it
the
lady
did
not
chide
me
and
after
this
she
seemed
even
in
a
softer
mood
as
for
me
i
felt
considerably
annoyed
for
i
had
not
wished
to
admit
that
any
thought
of
mr
vilars
had
ever
occupied
my
mind
you
should
not
speak
aloud
that
way
said
the
ghost
or
you
may
get
yourself
into
trouble
i
want
to
see
everything
go
well
with
you
because
then
you
may
be
disposed
to
help
me
especially
if
which
i
hope
i
shall
be
i
longed
to
tell
him
that
there
was
no
way
in
which
he
could
help
me
so
much
as
by
taking
his
instant
departure
to
make
love
to
a
young
lady
with
a
ghost
sitting
on
the
railing
near
by
and
that
ghost
the
apparition
of
a
much
dreaded
uncle
the
very
idea
of
whom
in
such
a
position
and
at
such
a
time
made
me
tremble
was
a
difficult
if
not
an
impossible
thing
to
do
but
i
forbore
to
speak
although
i
may
have
looked
my
mind
i
suppose
continued
the
ghost
that
you
have
not
heard
anything
that
might
be
of
advantage
to
me
of
course
i
am
very
anxious
to
hear
but
if
you
have
anything
to
tell
me
i
can
listening
eagerly
to
every
word
when
she
concluded
mrs
andrews
mused
a
moment
and
then
said
henceforth
miss
earl
and
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
introducing
you
to
such
of
my
friends
as
will
appreciate
your
talent
i
hope
you
will
not
confine
yourself
exclusively
to
my
children
but
come
down
sometimes
in
the
evening
and
sit
with
me
and
moreover
i
prefer
that
you
should
dine
with
us
instead
of
with
these
nursery
folks
who
are
not
quite
capable
of
appreciating
you
how
do
you
know
that
mamma
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
i
appreciated
her
before
i
found
out
that
she
was
likely
to
be
famous
before
i
knew
that
mr
manning
condescended
to
notice
her
we
nursery
folk
judge
for
ourselves
we
do
nt
wait
to
find
out
what
other
people
think
and
i
sha
nt
give
up
miss
earl
she
is
my
governess
and
i
wish
you
would
just
let
her
alone
there
was
a
touch
of
scorn
in
the
boy
s
impatient
tone
and
his
mother
bit
her
lip
and
laughed
constrainedly
really
felix
she
should
consider
herself
exceedingly
fortunate
as
she
is
the
first
of
all
your
teachers
with
whom
you
have
not
quarrelled
most
shamefully
even
fought
and
scratched
and
because
she
is
sweet
and
good
and
pretty
and
i
love
her
you
must
interfere
and
take
her
off
to
entertain
your
company
she
came
here
to
take
care
of
hattie
and
me
and
not
to
go
down
stairs
to
see
visitors
she
ca
nt
go
mamma
i
want
her
myself
you
have
all
the
world
to
talk
to
and
i
have
only
her
do
nt
meddle
mamma
you
are
very
selfish
and
ill
tempered
my
poor
little
boy
and
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
you
if
i
am
it
is
because
hush
felix
edna
laid
her
hand
on
the
pale
curling
lips
of
the
cripple
and
luckily
at
this
instant
mrs
andrews
was
summoned
from
the
room
scarcely
waiting
till
the
door
closed
after
her
the
boy
exclaimed
that
means
happy
lucky
and
she
had
no
right
to
give
me
such
a
name
i
am
infelix
nobody
loves
me
nobody
cares
for
me
except
to
pity
me
and
i
would
rather
be
strangled
than
pitied
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
at
rest
in
greenwood
i
wish
somebody
would
knock
my
brains
out
with
my
crutch
and
save
me
from
hobbling
through
life
even
my
mother
is
ashamed
of
my
deformity
she
ought
to
have
treated
me
as
the
spartans
did
their
dwarfs
she
ought
to
have
thrown
me
into
the
east
river
before
i
was
a
day
old
i
wish
i
was
dead
oh
i
do
i
do
felix
it
is
very
wicked
to
i
tell
you
i
wo
nt
be
called
felix
whenever
i
hear
the
name
it
makes
me
feel
as
i
did
one
day
when
my
crutches
slipped
on
the
ice
and
i
fell
on
the
pavement
before
the
door
and
some
newsboys
stood
and
laughed
at
me
tombstone
when
i
am
buried
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
angry
tears
dimmed
his
large
flashing
eyes
while
hattie
sat
with
her
elbows
resting
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
in
her
hands
looking
sorrowfully
at
her
brother
edna
put
her
arm
around
the
boy
s
shoulder
and
drew
his
head
down
on
her
lap
saying
tenderly
your
mother
did
not
mean
that
she
was
ashamed
of
her
son
but
only
grieved
and
mortified
by
his
ungovernable
temper
which
made
him
disrespectful
to
her
i
know
that
she
is
very
proud
of
your
fine
intellect
and
your
ambition
to
become
a
thorough
scholar
and
oh
yes
and
of
my
handsome
body
and
my
pretty
feet
my
dear
little
boy
it
is
sinful
for
you
to
speak
in
that
way
and
god
will
punish
you
if
you
do
not
struggle
against
such
feelings
i
do
nt
see
how
i
can
be
punished
any
more
than
i
have
been
already
happen
suppose
you
were
poor
and
friendless
an
orphan
with
no
one
to
care
for
you
suppose
you
had
no
dear
good
little
sister
like
hattie
to
love
you
now
felix
i
know
that
the
very
fact
that
you
are
not
as
strong
and
well
grown
as
most
boys
of
your
age
only
makes
your
mother
and
all
of
us
love
you
more
tenderly
and
it
is
very
ungrateful
in
you
to
talk
so
bitterly
when
we
are
trying
to
make
you
happy
and
good
and
useful
look
at
little
lila
shut
up
in
silence
unable
to
speak
one
word
or
to
hear
a
bird
sing
or
a
baby
laugh
and
yet
see
how
merry
and
good
natured
she
is
how
much
more
afflicted
she
is
than
you
are
suppose
she
was
always
fretting
and
complaining
looking
miserable
and
sour
and
out
of
humor
do
you
think
you
would
love
her
half
as
well
as
you
do
now
he
made
no
reply
but
his
thin
hands
covered
his
sallow
face
carpet
and
put
her
head
thickly
crowned
with
yellow
curls
on
his
knee
her
uncle
grey
had
given
her
a
pretty
ring
the
day
before
and
now
she
silently
and
softly
took
it
from
her
own
finger
and
slipped
it
on
her
brother
s
felix
you
and
hattie
were
so
delighted
with
that
little
poem
which
i
read
to
you
from
the
journal
of
eugenie
de
guerin
that
i
have
tried
to
set
it
to
music
for
you
the
tune
does
not
suit
it
exactly
but
we
can
use
it
until
i
find
a
better
one
she
went
to
the
piano
and
sang
that
pretty
nursery
ballad
joujou
the
angel
of
the
playthings
hattie
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
and
felix
partly
forgot
his
woes
and
grievances
now
i
want
you
both
to
learn
to
sing
it
and
i
will
teach
hattie
the
accompaniment
on
felix
s
birthday
which
is
not
very
distant
you
can
surprise
your
father
and
mother
by
singing
it
for
little
child
should
sing
it
so
that
it
glittered
in
the
sunlight
now
to
what
kingdom
does
this
belong
he
asked
another
bright
boy
answered
quick
ly
to
the
min
er
al
kingdom
sir
all
metals
belong
to
that
kingdom
that
is
a
good
answer
said
the
king
the
gold
piece
is
your
prize
the
children
were
de
light
ed
with
eager
faces
they
waited
to
hear
what
the
stranger
would
say
next
i
will
ask
you
only
one
more
question
said
the
king
and
it
is
an
easy
one
then
he
stood
up
and
said
tell
me
my
little
folks
to
what
kingdom
do
i
belong
the
bright
boys
were
puzzled
now
some
thought
of
saying
to
the
kingdom
of
prussia
some
wanted
to
say
to
the
animal
kingdom
but
they
were
a
little
afraid
and
looked
up
into
the
king
s
smiling
face
and
said
in
her
simple
way
i
think
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
king
frederick
william
stooped
down
and
lifted
the
little
maiden
in
his
arms
tears
were
in
his
eyes
as
he
kissed
her
and
said
so
be
it
my
child
so
be
it
the
barmecide
feast
there
was
once
a
rich
old
man
who
was
called
the
barmecide
he
lived
in
a
beautiful
palace
in
the
midst
of
flowery
gardens
he
had
every
thing
that
heart
could
wish
in
the
same
land
there
was
a
poor
man
whose
name
was
schacabac
his
clothing
was
rags
and
his
food
was
the
scraps
which
other
people
had
thrown
away
but
he
had
a
light
heart
and
was
as
happy
as
a
king
once
when
schacabac
had
not
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
long
time
he
thought
that
he
would
go
and
ask
the
barmecide
to
help
him
the
servant
at
the
door
said
come
in
and
away
hungry
schacabac
went
in
and
passed
through
many
beautiful
rooms
looking
for
the
barmecide
at
last
he
came
to
a
grand
hall
where
there
were
soft
carpets
on
the
floor
and
fine
pictures
on
the
walls
and
pleasant
couches
to
lie
down
upon
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
he
saw
a
noble
man
with
a
long
white
beard
it
was
the
barmecide
and
poor
schacabac
bowed
low
before
him
as
was
the
custom
in
that
country
the
barmecide
spoke
very
kindly
and
asked
what
was
wanted
schacabac
told
him
about
all
his
troubles
and
said
that
it
was
now
two
days
since
he
had
tasted
bread
is
it
possible
said
the
barmecide
you
must
be
almost
dead
with
hunger
and
here
i
have
plenty
and
to
spare
then
he
turned
and
called
ho
boy
bring
in
the
water
to
wash
our
hands
and
then
order
the
cook
to
hurry
the
supper
schacabac
had
not
expected
to
be
man
say
not
a
word
said
the
barmecide
but
let
us
get
ready
for
the
feast
then
the
rich
man
began
to
rub
his
hands
as
though
some
one
was
pouring
water
on
them
come
and
wash
with
me
he
said
schacabac
saw
no
boy
nor
basin
nor
water
but
he
thought
that
he
ought
to
do
as
he
was
bidden
and
so
like
the
barmecide
he
made
a
pretense
of
washing
come
now
said
the
barmecide
let
us
have
supper
he
sat
down
as
if
to
a
table
and
pre
tend
ed
to
be
carving
a
roast
then
he
said
help
yourself
my
good
friend
you
said
you
were
hungry
so
now
do
nt
be
afraid
of
the
food
schacabac
thought
that
he
un
der
stood
the
joke
and
he
made
pretense
of
taking
food
and
passing
it
to
his
mouth
then
he
began
to
chew
and
said
you
boy
said
the
old
man
bring
on
the
roast
goose
now
my
good
friend
try
this
choice
piece
from
the
breast
and
here
are
sweet
sauce
honey
raisins
green
peas
and
dry
figs
help
yourself
and
remember
that
other
good
things
are
coming
schacabac
was
almost
dead
with
hunger
but
he
was
too
polite
not
to
do
as
he
was
bidden
come
said
the
barmecide
have
another
piece
of
the
roast
lamb
did
you
ever
eat
anything
so
delicious
never
in
my
life
said
schacabac
your
table
is
full
of
good
things
then
eat
heartily
said
the
barmecide
you
can
not
please
me
better
after
this
came
the
des
sert
the
barmecide
spoke
of
sweet
meats
and
fruits
and
schacabac
made
believe
that
he
was
eating
them
now
is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
asked
the
host
ah
no
said
let
us
drink
then
said
the
barmecide
boy
bring
on
the
wine
excuse
me
my
lord
said
schacabac
i
will
drink
no
wine
for
it
is
for
bid
den
the
barmecide
seized
him
by
the
hand
i
have
long
wished
to
find
a
man
like
you
he
said
but
come
now
we
will
sup
in
earnest
he
clapped
his
hands
servants
came
and
he
ordered
supper
soon
they
sat
down
to
a
table
loaded
with
the
very
dishes
of
which
they
had
pre
tend
ed
to
eat
poor
schacabac
had
never
had
so
good
a
meal
in
all
his
life
when
they
had
finished
and
the
table
had
been
cleared
away
the
barmecide
said
i
have
found
you
to
be
a
man
of
good
un
der
stand
ing
your
wits
are
quick
and
you
are
ready
always
to
make
the
best
of
everything
come
and
live
with
me
and
manage
my
house
and
never
again
knew
what
it
was
to
be
hungry
the
endless
tale
in
the
far
east
there
was
a
great
king
who
had
no
work
to
do
every
day
and
all
day
long
he
sat
on
soft
cushions
and
lis
tened
to
stories
and
no
matter
what
the
story
was
about
he
never
grew
tired
of
hearing
it
even
though
it
was
very
long
there
is
only
one
fault
that
i
find
with
your
story
he
often
said
it
is
too
short
all
the
never
thought
his
soul
immortal
until
his
love
for
mercedes
came
into
it
perhaps
not
consciously
now
such
thoughts
would
have
seemed
to
for
no
man
can
live
quite
without
hope
as
we
believe
hope
of
some
event
some
end
of
suffering
at
least
of
some
worthier
act
with
jamie
it
was
the
hope
of
restitution
he
wished
to
leave
behind
him
as
the
score
of
his
life
that
he
had
been
true
to
his
employer
and
had
loved
his
little
ward
and
if
the
time
could
ever
come
when
he
could
do
more
for
her
it
would
not
be
until
his
theft
was
made
good
and
his
hands
were
free
as
his
heart
to
serve
her
again
for
the
one
thing
that
jamie
stood
for
was
integrity
that
was
all
the
little
story
of
his
life
his
salary
was
eighteen
hundred
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
after
his
theft
he
had
spent
a
hundred
and
fifty
then
he
asked
for
two
days
leave
of
absence
and
went
to
new
york
where
he
exchanged
sixteen
hundred
and
forty
dollars
for
spanish
gold
pieces
a
less
old
fashioned
man
would
jamie
could
not
forego
the
satisfaction
of
restoring
the
actual
gold
coming
back
he
opened
the
old
chest
now
empty
one
day
after
hours
and
put
the
pieces
in
the
box
the
naked
gold
made
a
shining
roll
in
its
blackness
just
reaching
across
the
lower
end
and
poor
jamie
felt
the
first
thrill
of
not
happiness
but
something
that
was
not
sorrow
nor
shame
and
then
he
pulled
down
the
old
ledger
and
made
the
first
entry
on
the
dr
side
restored
by
james
mcmurtagh
june
the
other
ten
dollars
had
gone
for
his
journey
to
new
york
and
that
night
as
he
went
home
he
looked
about
him
he
bowed
in
his
queer
way
to
one
or
two
acquaintances
who
passed
him
unconscious
that
he
had
been
cutting
them
for
a
year
before
supper
he
went
in
to
see
john
hughson
carrying
his
pipe
and
without
waiting
to
be
offered
it
asked
to
borrow
a
pinch
some
the
good
hughson
was
delighted
pressed
a
slab
of
plug
upon
him
and
begged
him
to
stay
and
have
something
liquid
with
his
pipe
but
jamie
would
not
he
was
anxious
to
be
alone
his
little
bedroom
gave
upon
the
roof
of
the
adjoining
house
in
the
rear
and
here
his
neighbor
kept
a
few
red
geraniums
in
boxes
and
it
was
jamie
s
privilege
to
smoke
his
pipe
among
them
so
this
evening
after
a
hasty
meal
he
hurried
up
there
beyond
the
roofs
of
the
higher
houses
was
a
radiant
golden
sky
and
in
it
the
point
of
a
crescent
moon
and
even
as
jamie
was
lighting
his
pipe
one
star
came
old
jamie
breathed
hard
and
sighed
and
the
sigh
meant
rest
he
took
a
pleasure
in
the
tobacco
in
the
look
of
the
sky
again
and
with
this
throb
of
returning
life
in
one
great
pulsation
his
love
rushed
back
to
his
heart
and
he
thought
of
mercedes
he
sat
up
of
dawn
he
wrote
to
her
ii
but
jamie
got
no
answer
to
his
letter
and
he
wrote
again
again
he
got
no
answer
and
he
wrote
a
third
time
this
time
by
registered
mail
so
that
he
got
back
a
card
with
her
name
signed
to
the
receipt
jamie
s
manner
unconsciously
to
himself
had
changed
since
that
first
row
of
gold
coins
had
gone
into
the
black
tin
box
the
tellers
and
the
bookkeepers
had
observed
it
and
they
began
to
watch
his
mail
again
what
was
their
glee
to
see
among
jamie
s
papers
one
morning
a
letter
in
the
familiar
feminine
hand
jamie
s
foreign
mail
has
come
the
word
went
round
i
thought
it
must
be
on
its
way
said
the
second
bookkeeper
have
nt
you
noticed
his
looks
lately
the
letter
is
postmarked
new
orleans
said
the
messenger
boy
turning
it
over
but
it
was
felt
this
went
beyond
friendly
sympathy
if
i
see
you
again
interfering
with
mcmurtagh
s
mail
you
may
go
what
business
is
that
of
ours
poor
o
neill
hung
his
head
abashed
but
all
eyes
were
on
jamie
as
he
opened
his
desk
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
the
clerks
looked
at
one
another
the
suspense
became
unendurable
when
old
mr
bowdoin
came
in
the
cashier
told
him
what
had
happened
jamie
s
foreign
mail
has
come
again
but
he
will
never
read
it
here
sir
and
we
ca
nt
send
him
out
till
lunch
time
the
chief
bookkeeper
the
old
gentleman
s
eyes
twinkled
mcmurtagh
he
cried
mr
bowdoin
had
always
called
jamie
so
since
he
came
into
the
bank
will
you
kindly
step
down
to
my
counting
room
i
will
meet
you
there
in
a
few
minutes
and
there
are
some
accounts
i
want
you
to
straighten
out
for
me
as
jamie
hurried
down
to
the
long
wharf
he
pressed
his
coat
tight
and
he
felt
it
warm
against
his
breast
neither
mr
james
bowdoin
nor
harley
was
in
the
little
room
it
was
just
as
jamie
remembered
it
when
he
first
had
entered
it
no
pretense
of
business
was
made
there
now
and
he
tore
the
letter
open
thus
it
ran
new
orleans
august
my
dear
dear
jamie
if
i
have
not
written
to
you
it
was
only
because
i
did
not
want
to
bring
more
trouble
on
you
but
things
have
gone
from
bad
to
worse
with
us
i
feel
that
i
should
be
almost
too
unhappy
to
live
only
that
david
is
with
me
now
jamie
sobbed
a
little
at
this
i
wanted
never
to
ask
you
for
money
again
but
we
are
very
very
poor
i
will
not
give
it
to
him
but
if
you
could
send
me
a
little
money
a
hundred
dollars
would
last
me
a
long
time
your
loving
m
st
clair
jamie
laid
his
head
upon
the
old
what
could
he
your
sake
and
work
my
uttermost
to
in
the
end
good
night
once
more
good
night
my
beautiful
my
own
good
night
bill
god
bless
you
she
sobbed
as
she
turned
her
horse
and
followed
the
texan
at
a
gallop
chapter
viii
foiled
by
a
woman
it
was
their
last
night
in
town
before
breaking
up
camp
and
the
black
hillers
as
they
already
called
themselves
under
chichester
were
determined
to
have
a
lively
time
of
it
they
commenced
wetting
up
or
pouring
down
liquid
lightning
in
camp
but
being
reminded
that
what
they
used
there
would
be
missed
on
their
journey
they
started
to
skin
the
saloons
in
town
and
finish
out
their
spree
where
it
would
not
diminish
their
own
stores
as
wild
bill
said
they
were
going
where
money
would
be
of
little
account
if
all
the
stories
about
the
gold
to
be
found
were
true
so
what
they
spent
now
they
would
nt
have
to
carry
and
they
went
in
as
such
reckless
men
could
and
drinking
with
a
looseness
that
promised
headaches
on
the
morrow
if
nothing
more
wild
bill
went
in
on
the
spree
with
a
rush
as
if
he
wished
to
drown
the
remembrance
of
his
late
fright
and
despite
the
cautions
of
his
friend
captain
jack
who
strove
hard
to
keep
him
within
bounds
california
joe
of
course
was
in
his
element
and
in
a
little
while
all
the
party
became
so
turbulent
that
crawford
left
them
in
disgust
for
as
addie
neidic
had
said
of
him
despite
his
associations
he
was
a
gentleman
by
midnight
every
saloon
had
been
visited
and
many
of
them
pretty
well
cleaned
out
and
now
bill
proposed
to
go
and
break
a
faro
bank
that
some
of
the
party
spoke
of
i
have
seven
hundred
dollars
left
out
of
a
thousand
my
woman
gave
me
before
i
started
said
he
i
ll
lose
that
or
break
the
bank
see
if
i
do
nt
all
of
the
party
he
was
before
the
green
board
without
even
waiting
to
get
the
run
of
the
game
be
planked
a
hundred
dollars
on
the
king
and
lost
without
a
word
he
put
two
hundred
dollars
more
on
the
same
card
and
won
he
left
the
four
hundred
down
and
in
another
turn
he
had
eight
hundred
luck
is
with
me
boys
he
shouted
i
ll
break
the
bank
let
her
swing
for
the
king
once
more
mr
dealer
to
the
wonder
of
all
though
it
was
the
last
turn
of
the
cards
the
king
won
and
wild
bill
picked
up
sixteen
hundred
dollars
his
friends
now
urged
him
to
quit
but
the
demon
of
the
game
had
entered
his
soul
and
he
swore
with
a
terrible
oath
that
he
would
play
till
he
broke
the
bank
or
was
broke
himself
a
new
pack
was
now
put
in
the
box
and
once
more
the
dealer
cried
out
make
your
bets
gentlemen
make
with
a
reckless
bravado
as
much
of
rum
as
of
his
own
nature
again
laid
all
his
winnings
on
one
card
this
time
the
queen
and
with
wonderful
luck
it
could
be
nothing
else
he
again
doubled
his
pile
this
time
his
gains
being
thirty
two
hundred
dollars
stop
now
bill
cried
california
joe
this
ca
nt
last
it
shall
last
the
bank
ca
nt
stand
more
than
two
more
such
pulls
shouted
bill
wildly
and
again
on
the
same
card
he
staked
his
entire
winnings
the
dealer
and
banker
were
one
he
turned
pale
but
when
all
bets
were
down
he
pulled
his
cards
without
a
tremor
in
his
hand
but
a
groan
broke
from
his
lips
as
the
queen
once
more
came
out
on
the
winning
side
once
more
bill
s
stakes
were
doubled
and
this
time
he
changed
his
card
the
banker
hesitated
his
capital
would
hardly
cover
the
pile
if
bill
won
again
keep
on
whispered
a
voice
i
ll
stake
your
bank
the
banker
looked
up
and
saw
though
she
was
disguised
in
male
attire
a
face
he
well
knew
it
was
that
of
addie
neidic
and
he
knew
she
was
able
to
keep
her
word
wild
bill
had
heard
the
whisper
and
his
face
was
white
with
rage
for
he
thought
the
bank
would
succumb
before
it
would
risk
another
chance
with
his
wonderful
luck
but
he
let
his
money
lay
where
he
put
it
and
cried
out
to
the
banker
to
go
on
with
his
game
if
he
dared
the
latter
with
firm
set
lips
cried
out
game
ready
gentlemen
game
ready
the
cards
were
drawn
and
once
more
wild
bill
had
won
coolly
as
if
money
was
no
more
than
waste
paper
bill
gathered
up
the
pile
and
began
to
thrust
it
away
in
his
pockets
when
the
disguised
woman
addie
neidic
thrust
a
roll
of
thousand
dollar
notes
into
the
hands
of
the
banker
and
cried
out
let
no
braggart
go
away
and
say
he
has
bluffed
the
bank
till
he
breaks
it
wild
bill
trembled
from
head
to
foot
i
know
you
he
hissed
you
are
the
woman
who
bluffed
me
at
the
livery
stable
i
ll
win
your
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
then
blow
the
top
of
any
man
s
head
off
who
ll
take
your
part
play
do
nt
boast
put
up
your
money
was
the
scornful
reply
in
an
instant
bill
put
every
dollar
he
had
won
every
cent
he
had
in
the
world
and
a
gold
watch
on

have

it

for

he
shouted
and
his
hand
went
to
his
belt
but
even
as
his
hand
touched
his
pistol
he
heard
that
fearful
whisper
sister
and
his
thoughts
were
even
then
busy
with
the
subject
of
the
address
which
as
president
he
was
to
deliver
on
that
occasion
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
seen
him
when
his
mind
was
more
active
or
more
vigorous
i
was
not
of
which
were
distinctly
novel
at
least
to
me
but
by
the
felicity
and
effectiveness
with
which
they
were
put
never
too
had
i
been
more
impressed
with
the
suavity
the
agreeableness
the
general
charm
of
his
manner
he
had
determined
during
the
coming
winter
to
learn
to
ride
the
wheel
and
we
then
and
there
planned
to
take
a
bicycle
trip
during
the
following
summer
as
we
had
previously
made
excursions
together
on
horseback
when
we
parted
it
was
with
the
agreement
that
we
should
meet
the
next
spring
in
washington
and
fix
definitely
upon
the
time
and
region
of
our
intended
ride
it
was
on
a
saturday
morning
that
i
bade
him
good
by
apparently
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
following
saturday
october
th
that
the
condensed
passionless
relentless
message
which
the
telegraph
transmits
informed
me
that
he
had
died
that
afternoon
that
very
day
he
had
lunched
at
a
friend
s
where
were
gathered
several
of
his
special
house
and
then
had
gone
to
the
office
of
the
hartford
courant
there
was
not
the
slightest
indication
apparent
of
the
end
that
was
so
near
after
the
company
broke
up
he
started
out
to
pay
a
visit
to
one
of
the
city
parks
of
which
he
was
a
commissioner
on
his
way
thither
feeling
a
certain
faintness
he
turned
aside
into
a
small
house
whose
occupants
he
knew
and
asked
to
sit
down
for
a
brief
rest
and
then
as
the
faintness
increased
to
lie
undisturbed
on
the
lounge
for
a
few
minutes
the
few
minutes
passed
and
with
them
his
life
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
words
he
had
fallen
asleep
from
one
point
of
view
it
was
an
ideal
way
to
die
to
the
individual
death
coming
so
gently
so
suddenly
is
shorn
of
all
its
terrors
it
is
only
those
who
live
to
remember
and
to
lament
that
the
suffering
comes
which
has
been
spared
the
victim
even
to
them
however
prepared
for
the
coming
of
the
inevitable
event
it
would
have
been
none
the
less
painful
when
it
actually
came
warner
as
a
writer
we
all
know
the
various
and
varying
opinions
entertained
about
the
quality
and
value
of
his
work
do
not
require
notice
here
future
times
will
assign
him
his
exact
position
in
the
roll
of
american
authors
and
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
to
anticipate
as
we
shall
certainly
not
be
able
to
influence
its
verdict
but
to
only
a
comparatively
few
of
those
who
knew
him
as
a
writer
was
it
given
to
know
him
as
a
man
to
still
fewer
to
know
him
in
that
familiarity
of
intimacy
which
reveals
all
that
is
fine
or
ignoble
in
a
man
s
personality
scanty
is
the
number
of
those
who
will
come
out
of
that
severest
of
ordeals
so
successfully
as
he
the
same
conclusion
would
be
reached
whether
we
were
to
consider
him
in
his
private
relations
or
in
his
career
as
a
man
of
letters
among
the
irritable
race
of
authors
no
one
years
of
close
intercourse
in
which
he
constantly
gave
utterance
to
his
views
both
of
men
and
things
with
absolute
unreserve
i
recall
no
disparaging
opinion
ever
expressed
of
any
writer
with
whom
he
had
been
compared
either
for
praise
or
blame
he
had
unquestionably
definite
and
decided
opinions
he
would
point
out
that
such
or
such
a
work
was
above
or
below
its
author
s
ordinary
level
but
there
was
never
any
ill
nature
in
his
comment
no
depreciation
for
depreciation
s
sake
never
in
truth
was
any
one
more
loyal
to
his
friends
if
his
literary
conscience
would
not
permit
him
to
say
anything
in
favor
of
something
which
they
had
done
he
usually
contented
himself
with
saying
nothing
whatever
failing
there
was
on
his
critical
side
was
due
to
this
somewhat
uncritical
attitude
for
it
is
from
his
particular
friends
that
the
writer
is
apt
to
get
the
most
dispassionate
consideration
and
sometimes
the
coldest
commendation
it
was
a
part
of
warner
s
generous
recognition
of
others
that
he
was
in
all
sincerity
disposed
to
attribute
to
ability
of
which
some
of
them
at
least
were
much
inclined
to
doubt
their
own
possession
were
i
indeed
compelled
to
select
any
one
word
which
would
best
give
the
impression
both
social
and
literary
of
warner
s
personality
i
should
be
disposed
to
designate
it
as
urbanity
that
seems
to
indicate
best
the
one
trait
which
most
distinguished
him
either
in
conversation
or
writing
whatever
it
was
it
was
innate
not
assumed
it
was
the
genuine
outcome
of
the
kindliness
and
broad
mindedness
of
his
nature
and
led
him
to
sympathize
with
men
of
all
positions
in
life
and
of
all
kinds
of
ability
it
manifested
itself
in
his
attitude
towards
every
one
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
it
led
him
to
treat
with
fullest
consideration
all
who
were
in
the
least
degree
under
his
direction
and
converted
in
consequence
the
toil
of
subordinates
into
a
pleasure
it
impelled
him
to
do
unsought
everything
which
lay
in
his
power
for
the
success
of
those
in
whom
he
felt
interest
many
a
young
writer
will
recall
his
when
the
quiet
appreciation
of
one
meant
more
to
him
than
did
later
the
loud
applause
of
many
as
it
was
in
public
so
it
was
in
private
life
the
generosity
of
his
spirit
the
geniality
and
high
bred
courtesy
of
his
manner
rendered
a
visit
to
his
home
as
much
a
social
delight
as
his
wide
knowledge
of
literature
and
his
appreciation
of
what
was
best
in
it
made
it
an
intellectual
entertainment

i

to
remind
you
of
of
no
it

nt
that
he
scowled
at
the
fire
art
meant
for
him
his
own
countless
daubs
and
the
sickening
smell
of
oily
paints
and
musk
and
soiled
silk
tea
gowns
and
the
whole
slovenly
disreputable
scramble
of
bohemian
life
in

i
loathe

he
said
with
a
furious
blow
at
the
smouldering
log
in
the
fireplace
as
if
he
struck
these
things
all
down
into
the
ashes
with
it
will
you
go
back
into
the
church
dear
his
mother
ventured
timidly
most
certainly
no

said
vehemently
of
all
mean
frauds
the
perfunctory
priest
is
the
meanest
if
i
could
be
like
one
of
the
old
holy
gospellers
then
indeed
he
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
began
to
stride
up
and
down
the
long
hall
his
head
thrown
back
his
chest
inflated
i
have
a
message
for
the
world
mother
she
interrupted
eagerly
but
i
must
deliver
it
in
my
own
way
i
have
lost
two
years
i
am
going
to
put
in
big
strokes
of
work
now
in
the
next
two
years
i
intend
to
take
my
proper
place
in
my
own
country
i
will
find
standing
room
for
george
waldeaux
with
a
complacent
smile
and
in
the
meantime
of
course
i
must
make
money
enough
to
support
you
and
the
boy
handsomely
so
you
see
mother
he
ended
laughing
i
have
no
time
to
lose
no
george
it
was
the
proudest
moment
of
her
life
how
heroic
and
generous
he
was
she
filled
his
pocket
book
the
next
day
when
he
went
to
new
york
to
take
the
world
by
the
throat
it
was
really
not
george
waldeaux
s
fault
that
she
filled
it
nor
was
it
his
fault
that
during
the
next
two
years
the
world
was
in
no
hurry
to
run
to
his
feet
either
to
learn
gold
the
little
man
did
his
best
he
put
his
message
as
he
called
it
into
poems
into
essays
into
a
novel
publishers
thanked
him
effusively
for
the
pleasure
of
reading
them
and
sent
them
back
the
only
word
of
his
which
reached
the
public
was
a
review
of
the
work
of
a
successful
author
it
was
so
personal
so
malignant
that
george
when
he
read
it
writhed
with
shame
and
humiliation
he
tore
the
paper
into
fragments
am
i
so
envious
and
small
as
that
before
god
no
words
of
mine
shall
ever
go
into
print
again
he
said
and
he
kept
his
word
he
came
down
every
month
or
two
to
his
mother
why
not
try
teaching
george
she
said
anxiously
these
great
scholars
and
scientific
men
have
places
and
reputations
which
even
you
need
not
despise
he
laughed
bitterly
i
tried
for
a
place
as
tutor
in
a
third
class
school
and
could
nothing
it
occurred
to
him
to
go
into
politics
and
help
reform
the
world
by
routing
a
certain
irish
boss
he
made
a
speech
at
a
ward
meeting
and
broke
down
in
the
middle
of
it
before
the
storm
of
gibes
and
hootings
what
was
the
matter
he
asked
a
friend
whose
face
was
red
with
laughter
my
dear
fellow
you
should
nt
lecture
them
you
re
not
the
parson
they
resent
your
air
of
enormous
superiority
for
heaven
s
sake
do
nt
speak
again
in
this
campaign
it
is
a
wretched
story
there
is
no
need
of
going
into
the
details
there
was
no
room
for
him
he
tried
in
desperation
to
get
some
foothold
in
business
the
times
were
hard
that
winter
which
of
course
was
against
him
besides
his
critical
haughty
air
naturally
did
not
prepossess
employers
in
his
favor
when
he
came
to
ask
for
a
job
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
the
man
broke
down
the
belongs
to
specialists
even
a
bootblack

his
trade
i
know
nothing
i
can
do
nothing
i
am
a
mass
of
flabby
pretences
every
month
she
filled
his
pocket
book
she
found
at
last
that
he
did
not
touch
the
money
he
sold
his
clothes
and
his
jewelry
to
keep
himself
alive
while
he
tramped
the
streets
of
new
york
looking
for
work
he
starved
himself
to
make
this
money
last
his
flesh
was
lead
colored
from
want
of
proper
food
and
he
staggered
from
weakness
he
that
will
not
work
neither
let
him
eat
he
said
grimly
it
was
about
this
time
that
miss
vance
came
home
mrs
waldeaux
in
a
moment
of
weakness
gave
her
a
hint
of
his
defeat
is
the
world
blind
she
cried
to
deny
work
to
a
man
of
george
s
capacity
what
does
it
mean
clara
heard
of
george
s
sufferings
with
equanimity
the
truth
is
she
said
when
she
told
the
up
to
believe
that
he
was
a
grand
llama
among
men
there
is
no
work
for
grand
llamas
in
this
country
and
when
he
understands
that
he
is
made
of
very
ordinary
clay
indeed
he
will
probably
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
lucy
was
watering
her
roses
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
she
said
what
the
people
of
new
york
think
of
mr
waldeaux
clara
looked
at
her
quickly
i
do
not
quite
catch
your
meaning

said
but
lucy
filled

and
forgot
to

clara
had
brought
miss
dunbar
back
and
established
her
in
her
own
house
near
one
of
the
chief
joys
of
your
future
i
have
always
wanted
you
to
marry
only
i
have
always
said
to
myself
not
yet
i
ca
nt
spare
him
yet
mothers
begin
their
children
s
lives
by
being
the
most
unselfish
beings
in
the
world
and
then
as
we
grow
older
i
m
afraid
we
are
inclined
to
go
to
the
other
extreme
i
wo
nt
tell
a
falsehood
and
say
i
am
glad
you
are
going
to
be
married
now
forgive
me
dear
forgive
me
but
in
my
heart
there
is
still
the
same
cry
not
yet
not
yet
oh
i
know
i
m
wrong
it
is
to
be
and
after
all
i
was
so
unprepared
and
you
are
my
life
dear
my
everything
you
must
let
me
sigh
just
a
little
i
ll
promise
to
be
all
smiles
at
the
wedding
when
you
first
laughed
in
the
sun
and
twinkled
your
baby
eyes
at
the
stars
i
was
not
a
very
happy
woman
you
were
only
six
months
old
when
i
divorced
your
father
how
much
i
have
regretted
that
step
since
it
would
have
been
far
better
had
i
borne
with
him
he
was
the
only
man
in
the
world
for
me
and
he
would
have
come
back
to
me
if
i
had
only
waited
then
instead
of
dying
wretchedly
miserable
as
he
did
he
might
have
been
alive
to
day
and
we
would
be
companions
for
each
other
but
i
was
proud
and
wilful
however
enough
of
that
as
i
said
when
you
were
a
tiny
baby
i
was
an
unhappy
woman
with
an
heart
empty
and
bruised
how
i
i
tell
you
nor
can
you
imagine
the
comfort
the
blessing
you
became
to
me
your
butterfly
like
little
kisses
made
well
all
the
bruises
your
little
hands
with
their
soft
flower
like
caresses
smoothed
away
the
troubles
and
before
long
you
seemed
to
have
crept
in
little
body
little
soul
into
my
heart
till
you
filled
it
completely
and
now
i
must
share
oh
we
are
selfish
we
mothers
for
i
want
all
all
i
used
to
be
a
little
jealous
in
those
early
days
even
of
your
nurse
do
you
know
rob
that
i
bathed
my
baby
every
morning
of
your
little
life
so
long
as
you
took
infant
tubs
i
would
nt
leave
it
to
anyone
else
and
for
more
than
one
year
of
your
life
in
the
middle
of
each
night
and
early
morning
i
warmed
over
a
little
spirit
lamp
i
have
it
yet
your
preparation
of
milk
and
fed
it
to
you
so
way
if
the
doctor
would
nt
let
me
feed
you
as
i
hungered
to
do
how
soon
it
was
you
knew
me
i
could
make
you
smile
when
no
one
else
could
and
what
a
joy
it
was
to
see
a
love
for
me
coming
into
your
infantile
existence
i
had
cried
a
good
deal
before
you
were
born
and
some
afterward
first
out
of
relief
and
then
for
pure
gladness
but
under
your
dear
influence
i
gradually
forgot
how
tears
came
you
almost
never
cried
and
what
a
good
baby
you
were
oh
a
blessed
baby
and
i
tried
to
repay
you
by
not
worrying
you
with
too
many
kisses
with
too
much
loving
which
i
m
sure
is
not
good
for
a
child
sometimes
i
had
to
clench
my
hands
so
strong
was
my
desire
to
take
you
up
and
clasp
you
tight
then
how
quickly
you
began
to
grow
and
before
long
my
letters
and
intimate
conversation
began
to
be
filled
with
what
rob
said
this
morning
i
never
knew
so
naively
witty
a
child
and
soon
you
reached
the
age
when
i
could
play
the
role
of
comforter
the
knocks
and
bruises
i
ve
healed
by
kissing
them
do
you
remember
one
third
i
m
sure
i
do
nt
the
many
imagined
slights
of
your
little
friends
which
were
forgotten
on
my
lap
the
little
aches
and
pains
that
were
slept
away
in
my
arms
how
full
my
life
was
then
what
a
blessed
boy
you
were
and
then
those
half
lonely
years
when
everyone
frightened
me
by
saying
you
would
be
spoiled
into
sending
you
away
to
school
i
begrudge
those
months
i
spent
without
you
yet
but
how
we
enjoyed
the
vacations
that
s
when
we
began
reading
together
again
real
stories
not
those
of
the
younger
days
do
you
remember
your
favorite
when
a
very
small
boy
we
always
read
it
when
you
were
nt
feeling
very
well
or
after
you
d
been
punished
for
being
naughty
sitting
together
in
the
great
big
old
whose
mother
died
in
a
garret
and
they
were
so
terribly
poor
they
had
to
beg
a
coffin
for
her
and
they
alone
followed
it
to
the
grave
there
was
a
very
trying
and
sad
woodcut
of
the
two
little
orphans
doing
this
and
we
always
cried
together
over
it
it
was
nt
a
healthy
story
for
a
small
boy
and
i
do
nt
know
how
we
got
hold
of
it
oh
yes
i
do
it
was
published
by
the
tract
society
and
had
a
moral
it
was
your
aunt
sent
it
to
you
but
i
have
forgotten
the
moral
the
football
period
began
in
the
school
vacations
and
went
all
through
college
but
still
i
think
you
were
always
more
fond
of
books
and
music
than
athletics
and
i
was
never
good
at
outdoor
sports
i
only
managed
to
master
tennis
so
as
to
be
able
to
play
with
you
the
four
years
of
college
had
some
loneliness
in
them
too
but
i
enjoyed
my
visits
to
williamstown
and
a
good
deal
again
for
i
said
when
rob
comes
out
he
will
want
to
go
he
will
have
at
least
three
cotillon
years
and
i
want
him
to
go
in
the
best
society
we
have
besides
there
is
sure
to
be
a
wife
let
her
be
a
girl
of
our
own
position
and
class
but
mary
said
she
this
is
where
mr
hatt
always
used
to
get
on
the
train
there
are
the
hatt
mills
and
he
goes
up
and
down
every
we
were
we
are
always
afraid
we
ll
meet
him
on
the
train
of
course
said
mary
leonard
leaning
forward
and
scanning
the
platform
with
its
row
of
idlers
and
its
few
travellers
well
he
is
nt
here
now
we
are
going
to
escape
him
this
time
but
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
i
do
nt
want
samuel
hatt
to
be
the
first
englefield
person
we
meet
they
looked
up
with
careless
curiosity
at
the
people
who
entered
the
train
there
was
a
little
girl
with
a
bunch
of
common
garden
flowers
following
close
behind
a
tired
looking
woman
who
had
been
obviously
spending
the
day
a
florid
old
gentleman
with
gold
spectacles
who
revealed
a
bald
head
as
he
removed
his
hat
and
used
it
for
a
fan
they
had
seen
him
hurrying
to
the
platform
just
before
the
train
moved
out
a
commercial
traveller
and
a
schoolboy
no
said
mary
leonard
he
is
nt
here
seat
in
front
of
them
and
continued
to
fan
himself
the
conductor
came
through
the
car
warm
spell
we
re
having
for
october
mr
hatt
he
said
as
he
punched
the
commutation
ticket
that
was
offered
him
mary
leonard
and
lucy
eastman
gazed
spellbound
at
the
back
of
mr
hatt
s
bald
head
they
were
too
amazed
to
look
away
from
it
at
each
other
it
it
must
be
his
father
gasped
lucy
eastman
he
looks
a
little
like
him
then
it
s
his
father
come
back
returned
mary
in
an
impatient
whisper
his
father
died
before
we
ever
went
to
englefield
and
do
nt
you
remember
he
was
always
fanning
himself
their
fascinated
gaze
left
the
shiny
pink
surface
of
samuel
hatt
s
head
and
their
eyes
met
i
hope
he
wo
nt
see
us
giggled
lucy
i
hope
not
let
s
look
the
other
way
in
a
few
minutes
mr
made
a
solemn
but
wavering
way
down
the
car
to
greet
a
man
who
sat
just
across
the
aisle
from
mary
leonard
both
the
women
avoided
his
eyes
blushing
a
little
and
with
the
fear
of
untimely
mirth
about
their
lips
as
he
talked
with
their
neighbor
however
they
ventured
to
look
at
him
and
as
he
turned
to
go
back
his
slow
deliberate
glance
fell
upon
them
rested
a
moment
and
without
a
flicker
of
recognition
passed
on
and
he
resumed
his
place
there
was
almost
a
shadow
in
the
eyes
that
met
again
as
the
women
turned
towards
one
another
i
i
know
it
s
funny
said
lucy
a
little
tremulously
but
i
do
nt
quite
like
it
that
we
look
to
him
just
as
he
does
to
us
we
have
hair
on
our
heads
said
mary
leonard
but
she
added
less
aggressively
we
need
nt
have
worried
about
his
speaking
to
us
train
rumbled
into
a
covered
station
mary
leonard
started
to
her
feet
and
then
paused
and
looked
down
at
her
companion
this
englefield
this
the
quiet
little
place
where
the
man
from
the
hotel
consented
to
look
after
their
trunks
while
their
cousins
drove
them
up
in
the
wagon
this
noisy
station
with
two
or
three
hotel
stages
and
shouting
drivers
of
public
carriages
lucy
said
she
sitting
down
again
in
momentary
despair
we
ve
gone
back
thirty
five
years
but
we
forgot
to
take
englefield
with
us
it
did
not
take
long
however
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
new
conditions
they
arranged
to
stay
at
the
inn
that
was
farthest
from
the
centre
of
things
and
the
drive
out
restored
some
of
the
former
look
of
the
place
it
was
near
sunset
the
road
looked
pink
before
them
as
they
left
the
city
the
boys
had
set
fire
to
little
piles
of
early
fallen
leaves
along
the
sides
of
the
streets
and
a
faint
pungent
smoke
hung
leaped
forth
vividly
now
and
then
from
the
dusky
heaps
as
they
left
the
paved
city
for
the
old
inn
which
modern
travel
and
enterprise
had
left
on
the
outskirts
the
sky
showed
lavender
through
a
mistiness
that
was
hardly
palpable
enough
for
haze
the
browns
and
reds
of
the
patches
of
woods
in
the
near
distance
seemed
the
paler
steadier
reproduction
of
the
flames
behind
them
low
on
the
horizon
the
clouds
lay
in
purple
waves
deepening
and
darkening
into
brown
mary
said
lucy
eastman
in
a
low
tone
laying
her
hand
on
her
companion
s
arm
it
s
just
the
way
it
looked
when
we
came
the
first
time
of
all
do
you
remember
remember
it
s
as
if
it
were
yesterday
oh
lucy
i
do
nt
know
about
a
new
heaven
but
i
m
glad
i
m
glad
it
is
nt
a
new
earth
quite
yet
there
was
a
mistiness
in
the
eyes
of
the
women
that
none
of
the
moved
by
the
sudden
sweet
recognition
that
seemed
sadder
than
any
change
the
next
morning
they
left
the
house
early
that
they
might
have
long
hours
in
which
to
hunt
up
old
haunts
and
renew
former
associations
again
the
familiar
look
of
things
departed
as
they
wandered
about
the
wider
gayer
streets
the
house
in
which
mary
leonard
s
cousins
had
lived
had
been
long
in
other
hands
and
the
occupants
had
cut
down
the
finest
of
the
old
trees
to
make
room
for
an
addition
and
a
woman
whose
face
seemed
provokingly
foreign
to
the
scene
came
out
with
the
air
of
a
proprietor
and
entered
her
carriage
as
they
passed
at
another
place
which
they
used
to
visit
on
summer
afternoons
and
which
had
been
approached
by
a
little
lane
making
it
seem
isolated
and
distant
the
beautiful
turf
had
been
removed
to
prepare
a
bald
and
barren
tennis
court
and
they
reached
it
by
an
electric
car
even
the
little
candy
shop
had
become
a
hardware
store
of
course
when
one
thinks
of
such
might
be
the
marshes
of
essex
or
indeed
the
blue
sea
itself
this
apple
tree
crowned
peak
was
a
kind
of
lookout
from
the
dead
country
to
the
living
sea
miss
ellwell
brought
thornton
out
at
the
mound
of
stones
on
the
crest
they
rested
their
arms
on
the
wall
looking
east
searchingly
for
the
bit
of
blue
coast
and
the
sails
there
there
i
can
see
it
she
cried
he
looked
at
her
incredulously
there
was
nothing
but
a
nebulous
mass
of
blue
well
i
have
seen
it
she
protested
two
or
three
times
to
day
it
is
a
bit
hazy
why
do
you
want
to
see
it
he
asked
idly
oh
it
is
so
different
it
is
big
and
strange
and
unfamiliar
do
nt
you
like
it
there
is
a
world
beyond
turned
to
the
shade
of
the
nut
trees
in
the
july
sun
the
woods
seemed
asleep
merely
soothed
by
a
wandering
breeze
and
they
flung
themselves
down
on
the
warm
ground
all
about
the
air
swam
with
pleasant
heated
drowsy
earthy
odors
as
she
took
off
her
hat
and
nestled
back
into
the
undergrowth
thornton
felt
her
anaemic
body
pale
from
the
fatigue
of
the
hot
walk
as
if
the
water
lily
were
drooping
in
the
mid
day
sun
yet
she
was
somehow
intimately
connected
with
the
brooding
earth
there
were
two
bodies
the
body
of
flesh
that
had
come
with
fatigue
and
feebleness
into
the
world
and
the
body
of
passion
that
was
blooming
into
power
she
talked
of
the
thousand
trivialities
that
go
to
make
the
conversation
between
a
man
and
a
woman
thornton
lay
silently
stretched
on
the
warm
leaves
at
her
feet
feeling
her
bloodless
face
with
its
sharp
blue
veining
each
was
conscious
of
a
dynamic
something
in
the
air
their
minds
had
a
frank
understanding
while
the
began
once
more
to
talk
of
the
sea
that
lay
down
there
beyond
the
green
meadows
and
the
blue
haze
a
faint
rose
color
of
animation
darted
over
the
pallor
and
made
the
moist
eyes
flash
the
sea
that
stood
in
her
mind
for
the
mysteries
of
change
of
the
unknown
thornton
knew
that
this
wistfulness
after
change
had
nothing
definite
in
it
was
merely
a
girl
s
hunger
for
motion
yet
that
had
divided
her
in
his
mind
from
her
kind
there
is
a
world
beyond
she
murmured
in
wondering
repetition
of
his
words
the
branches
of
the
nut
trees
swayed
in
the
odorous
wind
as
if
whispering
yes
yes
we
know
of
it
that
world
beyond
over
the
hills
of
flesh
and
the
tedious
wastes
of
tired
bodies
there
is
a
world
of
peace
beyond
her
eyes
came
to
his
face
wistfully
he
held
the
keys
of
that
beyond
something
had
snapped
in
his
well
ordered
mechanism
and
he
was
going
going
drifting
will
lessly
held
her
looking
into
a
face
that
burned
with
love
there
were
no
words
life
had
been
too
strong
for
his
little
plans
it
had
mocked
him
and
driven
him
passionward
like
a
bit
of
straw
caught
in
a
gale
the
hours
swam
on
unheeded
while
they
rested
there
face
to
face
then
came
the
going
home
across
the
afternoon
woods
she
silent
and
content
he
trying
to
account
for
himself
when
he
had
speculated
about
such
matters
he
had
seen
himself
discussing
quite
properly
the
serious
affairs
of
life
with
some
tall
girl
of
distinguished
carriage
some
one
of
the
many
young
women
whose
acquaintance
had
made
up
his
boston
parties
he
had
expected
that
their
conversation
would
grow
more
serious
as
this
intimacy
deepened
and
that
at
last
having
found
themselves
of
one
accord
on
the
sober
ideals
of
life
he
should
broach
to
her
this
final
proposition
involving
both
their
lives
he
had
half
imagined
such
a
situation
with
several
fine
young
women
the
scene
had
always
heavy
hangings
he
in
his
long
black
afternoon
coat
there
had
been
a
touch
of
solemnity
in
it
a
weighty
sense
of
responsibility
that
would
have
made
their
first
kiss
a
little
sepulchral
now
this
her
hand
touched
his
his
mind
left
these
bizarre
images
and
suddenly
it
seemed
that
life
was
one
wilderness
of
woods
in
the
late
afternoon
sun
down
which
he
was
fated
to
wander
in
a
lethargic
dream
one
dominant
feeling
of
tenderness
one
indifference
to
the
baying
of
reason
merely
love
and
the
soft
warm
earth
and
the
greenness
of
living
things
and
the
woman
whose
dress
brushed
his
arm
ah
that
was
sweet
and
precious
at
any
price
viii
he
had
put
something
in
motion
on
that
languid
july
day
and
suddenly
he
was
whirled
along
in
a
stream
of
consequences
there
was
an
interview
with
mr
ellwell
a
sudden
opening
of
the
ellwell
family
arms
and
he
was
one
of
them
not
much
to
his
relish
ruby
ellwell
brought
her
father
had
chummed
with
the
four
corners
renewed
its
worldly
life
in
a
garden
party
at
which
both
engagements
were
announced
thornton
had
to
stand
in
line
with
his
new
brother
in
law
and
for
all
this
disagreeable
business
the
sole
consolation
was
the
happiness
the
woman
he
loved
found
in
it
for
her
it
was
a
rehabilitation
of
the
family
the
first
dawn
of
those
better
times
she
had
looked
for
all
these
years
he
remembered
for
all
his
lifetime
how
his
father
had
met
her
how
he
had
walked
across
the
lawn
old
and
gray
and
aloof
and
had
taken
both
her
hands
he
had
smiled
at
her
tenderly
as
if
she
were
a
little
girl
much
as
he
had
smiled
years
before
at
jarvis
s
mother
then
he
had
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
and
had
stood
patting
her
hands
in
a
gentle
caress
later
he
had
slipped
away
in
the
same
quiet
abstracted
manner
for
the
rest
of
the
day
jarvis
thornton
had
been
a
little
sad
as
had
planned
a
simple
wedding
for
september
they
would
walk
to
the
village
church
the
old
white
hastening
to
fulfill
her
contract
with
haight
chapter
xliv
morton
rutherford
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
observed
the
expression
on
maverick
s
face
to
lyle
it
seemed
she
had
never
seen
such
venomous
malignity
as
was
in
the
look
which
he
gave
her
stepping
into
the
dining
room
a
few
moments
after
morton
had
left
she
heard
imprecations
and
curses
mingled
with
her
own
name
and
that
of
mr
cameron
and
realized
at
once
that
their
secret
was
known
then
as
he
hastily
left
the
house
she
heard
a
few
words
of
bitter
hatred
which
would
have
no
special
meaning
to
his
wife
friends
had
been
anticipating
for
the
last
few
days
readily
understood
the
wind
was
now
raging
down
the
canyon
with
terrific
force
but
lyle
had
but
one
thought
to
warn
those
whom
she
loved
and
save
them
from
danger
catching
up
a
light
wrap
which
she
threw
about
her
shoulders
she
rushed
out
of
the
house
passing
miss
gladden
and
ned
who
were
in
the
porch
watching
the
storm
and
who
tried
to
detain
her
lyle
what
is
the
matter
where
are
you
going
they
cried
to
the
mines
lyle
answered
raising
her
voice
above
the
roar
of
the
storm
they
are
going
to
fire
the
mines
and
they
are
all
there
morton
and
everard
and
jack
i
must
warn
them
if
i
can
lyle
come
back
shouted
ned
let
me
go
she
shook
her
head
i
must
go
i
know
the
mines
she
cried
and
turning
ran
down
the
out
of
sight
almost
before
they
realized
what
had
happened
meanwhile
morton
rutherford
had
found
houston
without
difficulty
they
are
coming
everard
he
announced
in
a
low
tone
they
will
be
here
to
night
what
are
the
indications
here
i
judge
from
haight
s
manner
that
word
of
some
kind
has
been
received
from
headquarters
but
just
what
is
to
be
done
or
whether
there
is
any
immediate
danger
i
can
not
yet
tell
i
am
going
over
to
haight
s
office
for
a
few
moments
said
rutherford
i
may
catch
some
message
from
the
company
that
will
show
us
the
situation
just
what
i
was
intending
to
suggest
said
houston
you
will
remain
here
until
i
come
back
yes
unless
i
should
detect
some
certain
signs
of
danger
in
that
case
i
shall
warn
the
men
and
shall
start
for
tunnel
no
that
part
of
the
mine
will
be
safe
very
well
you
will
probably
hear
from
me
within
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
and
rutherford
started
for
the
mills
haight
on
returning
to
the
office
from
dinner
waited
some
little
time
for
the
expected
dispatch
at
last
it
came
cameron
just
arrived
with
englishman
lindlay
and
attorney
going
out
to
the
mines
on
evening
train
are
at
arlington
hotel
van
dorn
at
same
hotel
and
in
telegraphic
communication
with
some
one
at
the
y
there
is
a
conspiracy
somewhere
what
do
you
know
answer
at
once
is
everything
ready
he
was
still
studying
the
contents
of
the
telegram
wondering
just
what
the
conspiracy
might
mean
when
minty
slyly
entered
and
by
means
of
the
information
she
had
secured
furnished
him
the
needed
key
to
the
situation
in
a
few
moments
the
following
answer
was
returned
the
truth
is
out
have
just
discovered
houston
is
cameron
s
nephew
out
here
in
his
interests
van
dorn
et
al
working
with
him
cameron
ready
awaiting
your
orders
just
as
the
message
was
sent
maverick
passed
on
his
way
to
his
post
and
seeing
him
haight
stepped
to
the
door
and
called
him
i
say
jim
i
ve
learned
the
truth
at
last
about
that
superintendent
of
ours
damn
him
you
seemed
so
interested
in
old
cameron
this
morning
i
thought
you
d
like
to
know
that
it
has
turned
out
that
this
houston
is
his
nephew
houston
old
man
cameron
s
nephew
gasped
maverick
with
a
terrible
oath
and
growing
fairly
livid
how
d
ye
get
onto
that
no
matter
how
jim
but
it
seems
he
s
been
out
here
all
summer
getting
onto
some
of
our
little
business
ways
and
reporting
to
the
old
man
and
now
he
s
got
the
old
fellow
out
here
to
see
the
fun
never
mind
jim
i
guess
the
fun
will
be
on
the
other
side
after
all
i
ll
attend
to
my
business
and
d
go
at
it
with
a
better
relish
after
this
little
piece
of
news
maverick
passed
on
his
way
regardless
of
the
storm
incapable
of
coherent
speech
muttering
oaths
and
curses
intermingled
with
the
vilest
epithets
haight
watching
him
with
a
grim
smile
for
a
few
moments
then
going
back
to
his
office
he
had
but
just
reseated
himself
at
his
desk
when
morton
rutherford
entered
the
outer
room
damn
him
what
is
he
sneaking
around
here
for
haight
soliloquized
at
the
same
time
hastily
transferring
a
revolver
from
his
desk
to
his
pocket
i
ll
spoil
that
mug
of
his
if
he
attempts
any
funny
business
here
this
movement
was
seen
by
rutherford
who
was
watching
him
closely
but
he
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
it
and
entered
the
office
as
usual
with
a
civil
greeting
to
haight
the
latter
sprang
to
his
feet
taking
his
position
close
by
the
shaded
window
his
right
hand
grasping
the
revolver
in
his
pocket
rutherford
s
haight
he
saw
there
could
be
no
semblance
of
civility
between
them
it
was
to
be
open
war
you
are
a
coward
he
said
and
you
are
a
sneak
haight
hissed
in
reply
prying
around
here
when
you
had
better
be
minding
your
own
business
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
attending
to
my
own
business
and
you
will
find
before
you
are
much
older
that
i
have
more
right
here
than
you
for
a
moment
haight
hesitated
astonished
by
rutherford
s
words
and
manner
then
was
about
to
make
some
reply
when
the
click
of
the
instrument
attracted
his
attention
keeping
his
eye
on
rutherford
he
gave
the
forty
pounds
a
year
he
complains
that
the
clergy
were
taxed
more
than
ever
the
church
having
become
an
ass
whereon
every
man
is
to
ride
to
market
and
cast
his
wallet
they
paid
tenths
and
first
fruits
and
subsidies
so
that
out
of
twenty
pounds
of
a
benefice
the
incumbent
did
not
reserve
more
than
l
s
d
for
himself
and
his
family
they
had
to
pay
for
both
prince
and
laity
and
both
grumbled
at
and
slandered
them
harrison
gives
a
good
account
of
the
higher
painful
diligence
in
their
calling
and
that
the
clergy
of
england
were
reputed
on
the
continent
as
learned
divines
skillful
in
greek
and
hebrew
and
in
the
latin
tongue
there
was
however
a
scarcity
of
preachers
and
ministers
in
elizabeth
s
time
and
their
character
was
not
generally
high
what
could
be
expected
when
covetous
patrons
canceled
their
debts
to
their
servants
by
bestowing
advowsons
of
benefices
upon
their
bakers
butlers
cooks
grooms
pages
and
lackeys
when
even
in
the
universities
there
was
cheating
at
elections
for
scholarships
and
fellowships
and
gifts
were
for
sale
the
morals
of
the
clergy
were
however
improved
by
frequent
conferences
at
which
the
good
were
praised
and
the
bad
reproved
and
these
conferences
were
a
notable
spur
unto
all
the
ministers
whereby
to
apply
their
books
which
otherwise
as
in
times
past
would
give
themselves
to
hawking
hunting
tables
cards
dice
tipling
at
the
ale
house
shooting
and
other
like
vanities
the
learned
trades
and
their
daughters
might
go
out
to
service
jewell
says
many
of
them
were
the
basest
sort
of
people
unlearned
fiddlers
pipers
and
what
not
not
a
few
says
harrison
find
fault
with
our
threadbare
gowns
as
if
not
our
patrons
but
our
wives
were
the
causes
of
our
woe
he
thinks
the
ministers
will
be
better
when
the
patrons
are
better
and
he
defends
the
right
of
the
clergy
to
marry
and
to
leave
their
goods
if
they
have
any
to
their
widows
and
children
instead
of
to
the
church
or
to
some
school
or
almshouse
what
if
their
wives
are
fond
after
the
decease
of
their
husbands
to
bestow
themselves
not
so
advisedly
as
their
calling
requireth
do
not
duchesses
countesses
and
knights
wives
offend
in
the
like
fully
so
often
as
they
and
eve
remarks
the
old
philosopher
of
radwinter
eve
will
be
eve
though
adam
would
say
nay
the
apparel
of
and
decent
than
it
ever
was
in
the
popish
church
when
the
priests
went
either
in
divers
colors
like
players
or
in
garments
of
light
hue
as
yellow
red
green
etc
with
their
shoes
piked
their
hair
crisped
their
girdles
armed
with
silver
their
shoes
spurs
bridles
etc
buckled
with
like
metal
their
apparel
for
the
most
part
of
silk
and
richly
furred
their
caps
laced
and
buttoned
with
gold
so
that
to
meet
a
priest
in
those
days
was
to
behold
a
peacock
that
spreadeth
his
tail
when
he
danceth
before
the
hen
hospitality
among
the
clergy
was
never
better
used
and
it
was
increased
by
their
marriage
for
the
meat
and
drink
were
prepared
more
orderly
and
frugally
the
household
was
better
looked
to
and
the
poor
oftener
fed
there
was
perhaps
less
feasting
of
the
rich
in
bishops
houses
and
it
is
thought
much
peradventure
that
some
bishops
in
our
time
do
come
short
but
this
is
owing
to
the
curtailing
of
their
livings
and
the
excessive
prices
whereunto
things
are
grown
harrison
spoke
his
mind
about
dignitaries
he
makes
a
passing
reference
to
thomas
a
becket
as
the
old
cocke
of
canturburie
who
did
crow
in
behalf
of
the
see
of
rome
and
the
young
cockerels
of
other
sees
did
imitate
his
demeanour
he
is
glad
that
images
shrines
and
tabernacles
are
removed
out
of
churches
the
stories
in
glass
windows
remain
only
because
of
the
cost
of
replacing
them
with
white
panes
he
would
like
to
stop
the
wakes
guilds
paternities
church
ales
and
brides
ales
with
all
their
rioting
and
he
thinks
they
could
get
on
very
well
without
the
feasts
of
apostles
evangelists
martyrs
the
holy
days
after
christmas
easter
and
whitsuntide
and
those
of
the
virgin
mary
with
the
rest
it
is
a
world
to
see
he
wrote
of
how
ready
the
catholicks
are
to
cast
the
communion
call
oysterboards
and
to
set
up
altars
whereon
to
say
mass
and
he
tells
with
sinful
gravity
this
tale
of
a
sacrilegious
sow
upon
the
rd
of
august
the
high
altar
of
christ
church
in
oxford
was
trimly
decked
up
after
the
popish
manner
and
about
the
middest
of
evensong
a
sow
cometh
into
the
quire
and
pulled
all
to
the
ground
for
which
heinous
fact
it
is
said
she
was
afterwards
beheaded
but
to
that
i
am
not
privy
think
of
the
condition
of
oxford
when
pigs
went
to
mass
four
years
after
this
there
was
a
sickness
in
england
of
which
a
third
part
of
the
people
did
taste
and
many
clergymen
who
had
prayed
not
to
live
after
the
death
of
queen
mary
had
their
desire
the
lord
hearing
their
prayer
says
harrison
and
intending
thereby
to
give
his
church
a
breathing
time
there
were
four
classes
in
england
gentlemen
citizens
yeomen
and
artificers
or
laborers
besides
the
nobles
live
without
work
and
buy
a
coat
of
arms
though
some
of
them
bear
a
bigger
sail
than
his
boat
is
able
to
sustain
the
complaint
of
sending
abroad
youth
to
be
educated
is
an
old
one
harrison
says
the
sons
of
gentlemen
went
into
italy
and
brought
nothing
home
but
mere
atheism
infidelity
vicious
conversation
and
ambitious
proud
behavior
and
retained
neither
religion
nor
patriotism
among
citizens
were
the
merchants
of
whom
harrison
thought
there
were
too
many
for
like
the
lawyers
they
were
no
furtherance
to
the
commonwealth
but
raised
the
price
of
all
commodities
in
former
free
trade
times
sugar
was
sixpence
a
pound
now
it
is
two
shillings
sixpence
raisins
were
one
penny
and
now
was
not
so
bad
as
this
everybody
came
running
to
see
what
the
matter
was
and
joanna
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
into
aunt
zelie
s
room
where
it
was
found
that
a
large
lump
on
her
head
and
a
bruise
on
her
arm
were
the
worst
of
her
injuries
bess
told
how
it
happened
i
ca
nt
think
what
ails
carl
lately
said
louise
he
is
a
mean
hateful
boy
sobbed
helen
i
do
nt
care
if
i
did
spoil
his
composition
feeling
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
talk
to
her
then
aunt
zelie
left
her
to
the
tender
ministrations
of
her
sisters
and
joanna
and
went
to
seek
the
chief
offender
he
was
still
in
the
girls
room
standing
had
hurt
helen
badly
had
passed
and
the
sight
of
his
composition
stirred
his
anger
afresh
is
it
true
that
you
threw
your
sister
down
his
aunt
stood
before
him
with
a
look
in
her
dark
eyes
which
it
was
not
pleasant
to
meet
carl
glanced
down
but
answered
yes
and
here
is
what
she
did
holding
up
the
blotted
paper
does
that
excuse
your
unmanliness
your
you
might
have
killed
her
you
know
i
ca
nt
talk
to
you
now
carl
you
d
better
go
to
your
room
i
ca
nt
tell
you
how
disappointed
i
am
he
never
thought
of
not
following
her
suggestion
indeed
he
was
glad
to
get
away
from
those
indignant
eyes
of
course
he
muttered
to
himself
i
am
all
to
blame
and
nothing
is
said
to
helen
about
spoiling
my
work
boys
are
always
found
fault
with
but
girls
can
do
anything
down
in
his
heart
he
knew
this
was
not
flung
himself
into
a
chair
by
the
window
it
was
a
gloomy
thawing
day
the
snow
as
if
aghast
at
the
trouble
it
had
caused
was
melting
sadly
away
there
was
nothing
in
the
prospect
to
make
him
feel
cheerful
after
awhile
he
went
to
work
on
his
composition
again
and
as
he
wrote
he
felt
more
and
more
like
a
martyr
when
it
was
finished
he
folded
it
and
put
it
away
and
began
to
think
it
must
be
near
lunch
time
with
the
door
closed
there
in
the
third
story
he
could
not
hear
the
bell
however
he
would
not
go
down
if
they
wanted
him
they
might
send
for
him
by
two
o
clock
he
was
feeling
deeply
injured
nobody
cared
whether
he
starved
or
not
then
he
remembered
that
uncle
william
was
to
take
them
to
see
hermann
that
afternoon
by
this
time
they
must
have
gone
without
him
carl
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
shed
some
tears
of
vexation
and
disappointment
all
the
while
something
was
the
afternoon
dragged
slowly
he
grew
very
hungry
and
at
last
saying
to
himself
that
he
would
go
and
get
some
biscuit
and
tom
sawyer
one
of
his
favorite
books
he
went
softly
downstairs
the
house
was
so
quiet
that
the
sight
of
mr
smith
asleep
on
a
hall
chair
was
a
positive
relief
after
visiting
the
pantry
he
went
to
the
library
for
his
book
the
door
was
half
open
and
when
he
reached
it
he
suddenly
stopped
for
there
was
aunt
zelie
by
the
table
with
her
head
bowed
on
her
arms
evidently
she
had
not
heard
him
and
carl
almost
held
his
breath
he
thought
she
was
crying
he
was
not
sure
but
certainly
she
was
unhappy
it
came
to
him
in
that
moment
as
it
never
had
before
how
tender
and
sweet
and
helpful
she
was
she
had
sorrow
of
her
own
he
knew
and
who
was
there
to
comfort
her
as
she
comforted
others
and
he
had
disappointed
her
had
behaved
shamefully
must
have
been
crazy
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
that
sorrowful
figure
and
turning
to
go
away
instead
the
next
minute
he
was
kneeling
beside
her
saying
aunt
zelie
i
am
so
sorry
she
was
startled
for
she
had
not
heard
him
but
she
turned
and
put
her
arms
around
him
for
a
moment
without
speaking
aunt
zelie
i
know
how
contemptible
i
am
you
ought
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
carl
exclaimed
in
a
great
burst
of
contrition
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
fast
as
she
answered
i
ca
nt
throw
stones
at
you
dear
but
perhaps
i
can
help
you
to
learn
the
lesson
i
have
had
to
learn
many
times
he
never
forgot
that
afternoon
how
he
sat
beside
her
with
his
head
on
her
shoulder
while
she
talked
to
him
as
she
had
never
talked
before
how
his
face
glowed
with
mingled
shame
and
pride
as
she
said
that
of
all
dearest
to
her
but
i
have
more
fear
for
you
than
for
the
others
i
long
to
have
you
grow
up
a
strong
true
man
master
of
yourself
in
every
sense
if
you
do
not
i
shall
feel
that
in
some
way
it
is
my
fault
i
will
try
to
be
what
you
want
me
to
be
like
uncle
carl
if
i
can
and
nobody
in
the
world
could
help
me
as
you
do
illustration
he
told
her
about
the
trouble
at
school
i
shall
not
leave
you
till
you
leave
me
aunt
zelie
said
smiling
rather
wistfully
at
the
tall
boy
that
will
be
never
and
i
will
always
take
care
of
you
answered
carl
laying
his
cheek
against
her
hand
he
told
her
about
the
trouble
at
school
too
finding
it
a
relief
to
confess
everything
and
she
listened
gravely
for
a
little
misunderstanding
like
this
a
little
hateful
pride
pleasant
friendships
are
given
up
and
the
good
times
have
my
good
neighbors
forgotten
their
motto
already
i
m
afraid
so
carl
said
thinking
how
hard
it
would
be
to
make
things
right
again
have
you
told
father
he
asked
no
he
did
not
come
to
lunch
then
i
shall
have
to
tell
him
with
a
sigh
this
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
that
which
had
arrested
his
attention
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
apparently
the
blank
leaf
of
a
letter
there
was
no
writing
or
mark
on
it
to
indicate
its
ownership
but
had
it
been
the
visiting
card
of
fred
greenwood
hank
hazletine
could
not
have
been
more
positive
that
it
belonged
to
the
young
man
it
was
impossible
that
motoza
should
carry
writing
paper
with
him
the
cowman
never
did
so
consequently
he
could
not
have
dropped
it
on
his
late
visit
it
was
equally
improbable
that
bill
tozer
had
anything
to
do
with
it
he
knew
that
both
of
the
boys
seen
them
figuring
over
some
problems
they
were
discussing
and
with
a
thrill
of
conviction
he
remembered
that
the
paper
they
used
was
of
precisely
the
same
pattern
as
the
piece
he
held
in
his
hand
the
younker
has
been
here
but
what
the
mischief
has
become
of
him
and
the
mystified
cowman
looked
right
and
left
on
the
floor
and
at
the
roof
as
if
he
suspected
the
youth
was
hiding
in
one
of
those
places
an
explanation
suggested
itself
after
taking
the
lad
to
the
cavern
his
captor
from
some
cause
had
changed
his
mind
and
transferred
him
to
another
place
of
confinement
no
there
was
another
theory
which
would
explain
the
mystery
it
was
that
motoza
yielding
to
his
implacable
enmity
of
the
youth
had
placed
him
beyond
all
reach
of
his
friends
the
spirit
of
revenge
with
an
american
indian
is
tenfold
stronger
than
cupidity
it
was
not
improbable
that
the
miscreant
having
committed
the
unspeakable
crime
was
concealing
it
from
tozer
his
ally
in
the
for
the
time
he
carefully
let
himself
down
from
the
ledge
to
the
rock
immediately
beneath
and
began
working
his
way
through
the
canyon
to
the
opening
at
the
break
his
familiarity
stood
him
in
as
good
stead
as
before
and
he
reached
the
place
without
mishap
climbing
the
steep
slope
to
the
higher
ground
he
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
thought
it
was
well
into
the
night
and
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
do
anything
more
he
was
as
firmly
resolved
however
as
before
not
to
be
outwitted
by
the
ruffians
with
whom
he
was
dealing
he
would
consent
to
no
attempt
to
pay
them
a
ransom
until
he
knew
beyond
peradventure
that
their
part
of
the
contract
would
be
fulfilled
if
they
try
any
crooked
work
he
muttered
with
deadly
earnestness
both
of
em
have
got
to
settle
with
hank
hazletine
he
gave
no
thought
to
jack
dudley
for
he
took
it
for
granted
that
he
had
been
able
to
look
out
for
known
to
him
he
reached
the
plateau
within
an
hour
after
the
arrival
of
the
youth
who
had
started
a
fire
and
was
doing
his
best
to
dry
his
clothing
and
gain
some
warmth
for
his
chilled
body
it
need
not
be
said
that
the
cowman
was
interested
in
the
story
told
by
the
youth
and
was
astonished
beyond
measure
to
learn
that
both
had
taken
the
same
route
one
actually
passing
the
other
without
either
suspecting
it
on
his
part
hazletine
related
all
that
he
had
passed
through
and
explained
the
reason
of
his
ascent
of
the
canyon
some
time
before
when
he
was
observed
by
the
wondering
lads
meanwhile
where
was
fred
greenwood
chapter
xix
into
the
cavern
hank
hazletine
and
jack
dudley
having
failed
to
find
the
missing
fred
greenwood
let
us
try
our
hand
at
the
task
going
back
to
that
afternoon
when
the
elder
youth
from
his
concealment
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
fired
down
into
the
little
herd
of
antelope
grazing
in
the
valley
in
front
of
him
will
be
remembered
that
fred
had
started
along
the
side
of
the
valley
with
a
view
of
placing
himself
beyond
the
game
and
rendering
the
success
of
himself
and
friend
certain
he
never
dreamed
of
danger
to
himself
his
attention
was
fixed
upon
the
pretty
animals
and
hungry
as
he
was
he
felt
a
sympathy
for
them
knowing
that
in
all
probability
one
of
the
number
would
be
sacrificed
nevertheless
he
put
forth
the
utmost
pains
to
prevent
their
taking
alarm
and
there
is
hardly
a
doubt
that
he
would
have
succeeded
in
his
purpose
but
for
the
catastrophe
which
overtook
him
when
half
the
distance
had
been
passed
suddenly
while
he
was
stealing
forward
in
a
crouching
posture
a
low
threatening
voice
reached
his
ear
only
the
single
word
stop
was
uttered
but
it
could
not
have
startled
the
youth
more
than
the
whir
of
a
rattlesnake
under
his
feet
before
he
could
straighten
up
he
turned
his
head
like
a
flash
not
a
rod
distant
kneeling
with
his
winchester
aimed
at
him
believing
that
he
would
press
the
trigger
of
his
weapon
the
next
moment
fred
greenwood
was
transfixed
he
could
only
look
at
his
enemy
and
await
the
end
he
was
without
the
power
to
raise
a
finger
in
his
own
defence
drop
gun
commanded
his
master
the
words
showed
the
lad
that
he
had
a
few
minutes
at
least
to
live
but
the
drop
was
on
him
and
he
promptly
obeyed
drop
little
gun
added
the
sioux
who
never
wavered
in
keeping
his
rifle
pointed
at
the
chest
of
the
young
man
fred
withdrew
his
revolver
and
flung
it
at
his
feet
he
was
now
without
a
single
firearm
an
infant
could
not
have
been
more
helpless
as
yet
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
he
recalled
the
warning
of
jack
dudley
and
knew
the
ferocious
hatred
this
vagrant
redskin
held
toward
him
to
appeal
for
mercy
would
delight
the
miscreant
and
not
aid
the
prisoner
he
tried
another
tack
the
question
pleased
the
sioux
who
partly
lowering
his
rifle
still
held
it
ready
for
instant
use
his
ugly
countenance
was
broken
by
the
old
grin
huh
you
call
motoza
tief
eh
that
s
what
i
called
you
and
that
s
what
you
are
huh
few
weeks
father
she
said
i
want
to
know
why
i
may
nt
go
and
see
other
little
boys
and
girls
and
go
to
church
and
go
to
see
the
people
in
the
cottages
as
norah
and
tom
and
ruth
do
chapter
vii
secrets
what
makes
you
ask
that
question
una
said
her
father
when
we
have
lived
in
other
countries
you
have
never
asked
to
have
little
boys
and
girls
to
play
with
or
worried
about
why
you
may
not
go
and
see
people
and
go
to
church
and
here
you
have
norah
and
tom
and
dan
to
play
with
surely
that
is
enough
but
i
did
nt
know
before
that
little
boys
and
girls
at
least
when
i
saw
other
little
boys
and
girls
playing
with
each
other
i
thought
they
were
brothers
and
sisters
or
cousins
and
of
course
i
have
nt
got
any
brothers
or
sisters
or
cousins
of
my
very
own
but
now
that
i
know
what
little
boys
and
girls
do
i
do
want
to
go
to
church
and
go
to
tea
with
them
in
their
houses
and
do
things
like
them
please
father
let
me
and
una
clasped
her
hands
coaxingly
as
she
thought
of
the
dear
old
lady
and
gentleman
she
had
been
to
tea
with
that
afternoon
the
flower
filled
garden
the
yellow
honeycomb
the
gold
fish
and
the
black
puppy
and
the
cockatoo
the
old
gentleman
had
promised
to
show
her
the
next
time
she
came
all
floated
through
her
brain
as
she
waited
for
her
father
s
answer
but
monsieur
gen
shook
his
head
no
dear
he
said
to
himself
he
was
thinking
that
perhaps
he
had
been
foolish
to
allow
una
to
be
friends
with
known
that
it
would
make
her
restless
and
dissatisfied
with
the
quiet
life
she
had
been
quite
content
to
live
before
then
he
roused
himself
and
looked
down
kindly
at
his
little
girl
are
you
very
disappointed
poor
little
una
he
said
putting
his
arm
round
her
and
drawing
her
to
his
side
do
nt
look
so
sad
and
i
will
try
and
explain
to
you
why
it
is
that
you
have
never
had
little
friends
and
companions
of
your
own
age
una
looked
at
him
still
gravely
but
with
the
light
of
a
growing
interest
in
her
eyes
then
she
fetched
a
little
stool
and
sat
down
at
her
father
s
feet
you
must
know
una
dear
said
her
father
smiling
rather
sadly
as
he
looked
down
at
her
that
each
one
of
us
has
some
kind
of
work
to
do
in
the
world
we
may
do
it
badly
or
we
may
do
it
well
or
we
may
not
even
try
to
do
to
try
to
do
something
to
help
our
fellow
men
do
you
understand
little
one
una
nodded
yes
father
i
quite
understand
she
said
it
was
not
often
that
her
father
talked
in
this
way
it
was
rather
like
listening
to
the
vicar
s
sermon
the
only
sunday
she
had
ever
been
to
church
she
thought
as
she
leant
her
head
against
her
father
s
knee
and
monsieur
gen
went
on
speaking
well
dear
sometimes
people
can
help
each
other
to
do
their
bits
of
work
in
the
world
and
sometimes
too
they
can
spoil
other
people
s
work
and
there
are
some
people
who
are
trying
very
hard
to
spoil
the
work
which
i
am
doing
una
sprang
to
her
feet
father
how
dare
they
she
said
indignantly
horrid
people
i
hate
them
her
father
reached
out
his
hand
and
drew
her
to
him
but
as
long
as
they
can
not
find
out
or
how
i
am
doing
it
they
can
not
really
spoil
my
work
and
that
is
why
i
have
never
made
friends
with
people
in
any
of
the
different
places
where
we
have
stayed
in
case
the
people
who
want
to
spoil
my
work
should
try
and
find
out
through
these
new
friends
who
i
am
and
what
i
am
doing
and
that
is
why
i
want
you
my
little
una
to
help
me
to
keep
my
work
as
secret
as
possible
oh
father
i
will
i
will
cried
una
only
only
i
do
nt
quite
see
how
i
can
let
out
a
secret
if
i
do
nt
exactly
know
what
it
is
i
can
not
tell
you
all
the
secret
little
una
said
her
father
at
least
not
until
you
are
older
and
can
understand
more
about
it
but
if
i
were
to
let
you
make
friends
and
go
about
wherever
you
like
people
would
begin
to
wonder
where
you
came
from
and
who
and
what
i
did
and
although
not
really
knowing
my
secret
you
might
let
out
little
bits
of
it
until
people
began
to
wonder
and
talk
about
you
and
me
one
can
never
be
too
careful
he
added
half
to
himself
yes
i
understand
father
said
una
gravely
and
she
sat
at
her
father
s
feet
looking
into
the
fire
and
not
talking
much
until
the
little
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
struck
seven
and
marie
came
to
tell
her
that
it
was
bedtime
i
wonder
whether
i
was
wise
in
telling
her
so
much
monsieur
gen
thought
to
himself
when
his
little
daughter
had
gone
but
it
seemed
the
only
thing
to
be
done
and
she
is
prudent
beyond
her
years
poor
little
lonely
girl
i
do
not
think
she
will
chatter
about
anything
i
have
told
her
for
some
time
after
this
una
was
rather
quiet
and
sad
more
like
what
she
had
been
when
norah
and
dan
first
to
laugh
and
play
as
she
had
been
of
late
the
secret
her
father
had
told
her
weighed
heavily
on
the
little
girl
s
mind
she
was
so
afraid
that
she
might
have
let
out
to
her
little
friends
though
unknowingly
something
about
her
father
s
work
and
she
was
careful
now
not
to
say
anything
which
might
lead
them
to
ask
questions
about
him
one
afternoon
she
was
walking
to
the
man
in
charge
and
double
quick
too
the
man
stared
but
helena
rattled
the
gold
in
her
pocket
and
he
called
to
two
men
to
hitch
up
upon
my
soul
he
whispered
to
his
associates
it
s
those
kids
of
jack
belmont
s
and
old
yorba
s
or
i
m
a
dead
man
but
it
ai
nt
none
of
my
business
and
i
ai
nt
one
to
peach
i
like
spirit
we
re
going
to
the
fire
and
i
wish
the
hack
to
wait
for
us
said
helena
as
he
signified
that
all
was
ready
i
ll
pay
you
now
how
much
is
it
ten
dollars
he
replied
unblushingly
helena
paid
the
money
like
a
blood
magdalena
horrified
at
the
extravagance
her
own
allowance
was
five
dollars
a
month
she
asked
remonstrantly
as
the
hack
slid
down
the
steep
hill
i
got
fifty
dollars
out
of
jack
to
night
he
s
feeling
awfully
soft
over
my
going
away
poor
old
jack
he
ll
feel
so
lonesome
without
me
but
we
ll
have
a
gay
old
time
travelling
together
in
europe
when
i
m
through
magdalena
did
not
speak
of
her
conversation
with
her
own
parent
she
did
not
want
to
think
of
it
this
night
was
to
be
one
of
uniform
joy
they
were
a
quarter
of
an
hour
reaching
the
fire
as
they
turned
into
the
great
central
artery
of
the
city
market
street
they
leaned
forward
and
gazed
eagerly
at
the
dense
highly
coloured
mass
of
men
and
women
mostly
young
who
promenaded
the
north
sidewalk
under
a
blaze
of
gas
what
queer
looking
girls
said
magdalena
why
do
they
wear
so
many
frizzes
and
sailor
hats
on
one
side
they
re
chippies
said
helena
wisely
what
s
street
they
work
all
day
and
promenade
with
their
beaux
all
evening
as
i
live
lena
we
re
going
down
fourth
street
we
ll
go
right
through
chippytown
they
had
been
south
of
market
street
before
for
ila
and
tiny
lived
on
the
aristocratic
rincon
hill
but
their
way
had
always
lain
down
second
street
which
was
old
but
stately
and
respectable
fourth
street
like
market
street
by
night
would
be
a
new
country
but
after
a
few
moments
eager
attention
helena
sniffed
with
disappointment
the
narrow
street
and
those
branching
from
it
were
ill
lighted
and
deserted
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
low
browed
shops
but
there
was
always
the
red
glare
beyond
and
in
a
few
moments
the
holocaust
burst
upon
them
in
all
its
terrible
magnificence
they
sprang
out
of
the
hack
and
walked
rapidly
to
the
edge
of
the
crowd
which
filled
the
street
in
spite
of
the
warning
cries
of
the
firemen
and
the
angry
shouts
of
the
policemen
the
fire
was
dwellings
beyond
a
great
furniture
factory
and
innumerable
tenements
were
vanishing
like
icicles
under
a
hot
sun
the
girls
careless
of
the
severe
jostling
they
received
stared
in
fascinated
amazement
at
the
red
tongues
darting
among
the
blackened
shells
the
crashing
roofs
the
black
masses
of
smoke
above
cut
with
narrow
swords
of
flame
the
solid
pillar
of
fire
above
the
factory
the
futile
streams
of
water
the
gallant
efforts
of
the
firemen
magdalena
hardly
knowing
why
reflected
with
deep
satisfaction
that
a
fire
was
even
more
wonderful
at
close
quarters
than
when
viewed
from
a
distance
every
detail
delighted
her
but
when
a
clumsy
boy
stepped
on
her
toes
she
drew
helena
into
a
sand
lot
opposite
where
it
was
less
crowded
it
was
then
that
she
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
weeping
women
gathered
about
their
household
goods
she
stared
at
them
for
a
moment
then
shook
the
rapt
helena
by
the
arm
look
she
whispered
what
is
the
matter
with
those
absently
oh
do
nt
i
wish
i
were
on
that
house
with
a
hose
in
my
hand
what
a
lovely
exciting
life
a
fireman
s
must
be
then
yielding
to
magdalena
s
insistence
she
turned
and
directed
her
gaze
to
the
people
in
the
lot
behind
her
oh
the
poor
things
she
said
forgetting
the
fire
they
ve
been
burnt
out
let
s
talk
to
them
the
two
girls
approached
the
unfortunate
creatures
who
were
wailing
loudly
as
if
at
a
wake
poor
devils
exclaimed
helena
i
am
so
glad
i
have
some
silver
with
me
and
i
have
nothing
to
give
them
thought
magdalena
bitterly
but
she
was
too
proud
to
speak
she
stared
at
them
her
brain
a
medley
of
new
sensations
as
helena
went
about
questioning
fascinating
sympathising
giving
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
poverty
she
had
barely
heard
of
its
existence
condescended
to
borrow
from
life
it
was
not
abject
poverty
that
she
witnessed
by
any
means
there
were
no
hollow
cheeks
here
no
pallid
faces
no
shrunken
limbs
it
was
save
for
the
passing
distress
to
which
they
were
not
unaccustomed
a
very
jolly
hearty
contented
poverty
their
belongings
were
certainly
mean
but
solid
and
sufficient
nevertheless
to
magdalena
who
had
been
surrounded
by
luxury
from
her
birth
and
had
rarely
been
in
a
street
of
less
importance
than
her
own
these
commonly
clad
creatures
weeping
over
their
cheap
household
goods
seemed
the
very
dregs
of
the
earth
her
keen
enjoyment
fled
she
was
sure
she
could
never
be
happy
again
with
so
much
misery
in
the
world
if
her
father
would
only
she
recalled
his
contempt
for
charities
the
prohibition
he
had
laid
on
her
mother
she
determined
to
pray
all
night
to
the
virgin
to
soften
his
heart
when
the
virgin
had
been
allowed
a
reasonable
time
she
would
beg
him
to
give
the
virgin
had
failed
her
many
times
but
must
surely
hearken
to
so
worthy
a
petition
as
this
she
stood
apart
no
one
noticed
her
she
had
nothing
to
give
they
were
showering
blessings
upon
helena
who
was
walking
about
with
a
cocky
little
stride
well
pleased
with
herself
suddenly
helena
wheeled
and
ran
over
to
magdalena
i
ve
given
away
loving
gaze
it
vanished
and
was
gone
a
wave
of
colour
swept
over
her
face
her
eyes
wavered
gave
one
imploring
glance
me
susan
d
asked
margaret
once
more
n
no
said
susan
d
in
a
whisper
scarcely
audible
no
and
why
not
dear
child
i
promised
whispered
susan
d
susan
d
do
you
know
anything
about
that
strange
noise
that
frightened
us
so
last
night
but
not
another
word
would
susan
d
say
she
looked
loving
imploring
deprecating
she
threw
her
arms
around
margaret
s
neck
and
hid
her
face
and
clung
to
her
but
no
word
could
she
be
brought
to
say
at
last
margaret
displeased
and
puzzled
felt
constrained
to
tell
the
child
rather
sternly
to
fold
her
work
and
go
away
and
not
come
back
to
her
till
she
could
answer
questions
properly
susan
went
obediently
at
the
door
she
hesitated
and
margaret
heard
a
little
sigh
which
made
her
heart
go
out
in
sympathy
toward
the
little
creature
instantly
she
rose
and
going
to
the
child
put
her
arms
round
puzzled
about
something
she
said
quickly
susan
d
nodded
and
clung
close
to
her
cousin
s
side
i
will
not
ask
you
anything
more
said
margaret
i
am
going
to
trust
you
susan
d
not
to
do
anything
wrong
remember
dear
that
the
two
most
important
things
in
the
world
are
truth
and
kindness
now
kiss
me
dear
and
go
left
alone
margaret
sat
for
some
time
puzzling
over
what
had
happened
and
wondering
what
would
happen
next
it
was
evident
that
the
children
were
concerned
in
some
way
or
at
least
had
some
knowledge
of
the
mysterious
sounds
which
had
so
alarmed
miss
sophronia
what
ought
she
to
do
how
far
must
she
try
to
force
confession
from
them
if
it
were
her
duty
to
try
and
how
could
she
do
it
thus
pondering
she
became
aware
of
voices
in
the
air
she
sat
near
the
open
window
and
the
voices
were
from
above
her
and
holding
her
breath
well
if
you
back
out
now
susan
d
it
will
be
mean
basil
was
saying
what
did
you
say
to
her
i
did
nt
say
anything
susan
d
answered
sullenly
why
did
nt
you
tell
her
that
we
had
a
pain
and
did
nt
want
to
bother
her
cause
she
had
company
cried
merton
eagerly
i
had
that
all
fixed
to
tell
her
only
she
never
asked
me
i
would
nt
tell
her
a
lie
said
susan
d
basil
you
would
nt
tell
her
a
lie
either
you
know
you
would
nt
when
she
looks
at
you
that
way
straight
at
you
and
you
ca
nt
get
your
eyes
away
of
course
i
would
nt
said
basil
and
the
reason
she
did
nt
ask
you
merton
was
because
she
knew
it
would
nt
make
much
difference
what
you
said
susan
if
you
had
only
had
a
little
dipplo
macy
you
could
have
got
through
all
right
as
i
did
i
do
nt
know
what
you
mean
by
dipplo
macy
retorted
susan
ho
stupid
sneered
merton
i
do
nt
believe
you
know
what
it
means
yourself
cried
basil
come
tell
now
if
you
are
so
wise
what
does
it
mean
ah
i
knew
you
did
nt
know
you
are
a
sneak
mert
well
i
guess
in
the
beginning
when
adam
was
making
the
words
you
know
he
must
have
wanted
to
hide
from
the
serpent
or
something
perhaps
a
hairy
mammoth
or
a
megatherium
i
should
nt
wonder
so
he
said
dip
low
and
then
massy
for
a
kind
of
exclamation
you
see
and
spelling
gets
changed
a
lot
in
the
course
of
time
you
can
see
that
just
from
one
class
to
another
in
the
grammar
school
round
things
managing
them
without
telling
lies
or
truth
either
you
ve
got
to
tell
one
or
the
other
objected
susan
d
no
you
have
nt
either
now

cried
merton
we
ve
got
lots
of
things
to
see
to
we
have
to
the
voices
were
gone
margaret
sat
still
sewing
steadily
and
working
many
thoughts
into
her
seam
it
might
have
been
half
an
hour
after
this
that
basil
burst
into
the
room
breathless
and
beaming
his
tow
colored
hair
standing
on
end
oh
cousin
margaret
can
i
i
mean
may
i
go
over
to
first
he
but
peered
within
and
listened
then
he
stood
quiet
for
a
space
as
if
he
waited
for
what
we
could
not
tell
none
of
us
being
sufficiently
near
to
prevent
and
the
power
of
the
demon
prevailing
over
weak
and
mortal
flesh
he
mounted
the
curb
and
amid
the
most
horrid
shrieks
cursings
and
revilings
proceeding
from
the
foul
below
wherefrom
came
only
faint
groans
for
a
short
space
thus
died
pedro
d
ortez
lord
of
cartillon
leaving
the
task
of
getting
out
his
body
to
those
vassals
who
greatly
perturbed
in
spirit
gathered
at
the
spot
we
hastened
away
horrified
at
such
abominations
of
beelzebub
as
we
had
witnessed
being
for
our
fear
and
little
faith
made
culpable
before
god
and
hoping
to
repurchase
peace
by
great
penitence
report

rendered

the
most
reverend
and
illustrious

further
facts
having
come
to
my
knowledge
in
this
the
year
of
grace
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
eighty
nine
which
do
most
his
visitation
of
the
sins
of
the
father
upon
the
children
of
them
who
hate
him
it
is
deemed
meet
and
proper
that
they
be
here
set
down
and
perpetuated
for
that
future
generations
may
know
the
truth
therefore
be
it
held
in
everlasting
memory
that
pedro
d
ortez
the
same
who
has
been
by
me
beforementioned
as
of
a
profane
carnal
and
blood
guilty
life
living
not
with
the
fear
of
god
before
his
eyes
but
filled
with
evil
at
the
instigation
of
the
devil
the
said
pedro
having
at
this
period
two
sons
desired
that
the
elder
should
according
to
secular
law
inherit
his
title
and
lands
he
desired
also
that
the
younger
raoul
might
enter
the
armies
of
the
king
but
raoul
nothing
loath
in
so
far
as
the
fighting
there
was
concerned
lusted
yet
for
the
gold
and
acres
which
were
his
father
s
pedro
the
elder
brother
being
of
a
mild
and
amiable
temper
designed
more
for
the
cloister
than
the
camp
raoul
and
meekness
of
spirit
all
of
these
facts
being
stated
and
related
to
me
by
brother
julian
who
went
betimes
to
the
castle
for
alms
and
tithes
which
same
were
frequent
denied
and
withheld
to
the
great
detriment
of
our
just
dues
one
day
after
a
more
than
usually
violent
quarrel
between
pedro
and
raoul
their
father
came
suddenly
upon
them
in
a
retired
portion
of
the
castle
grounds
the
sight
was
enough
to
startle
even
a
man
so
used
to
shedding
human
blood
as
had
been
the
lord
of
cartillon
pedro
was
slowly
sinking
to
the
ground
easing
himself
down
somewhat
upon
his
knees
and
elbows
his
brother
stood
near
watching
and
calmly
wiping
the
red
drippings
from
his
sword
upon
the
grass
not
a
semblance
of
regret
did
he
show
for
the
deed
of
blood
the
father
gazed
transfixed
with
horror
from
one
son
to
the
other
until
the
slow
comprehension
came
to
him
how
now
raoul
what
hast
thou
done
the
older
man
demanded
of
raoul
canst
lordship
of
this
fair
domain
the
younger
replied
full
as
sturdily
hot
and
scornful
with
lowering
brow
and
unrepenting
glare
thou
foul
and
unnatural
murderer
and
thinkest
thou
to
profit
by
thy
brother
s
death
no
i
swear
hold
old
man
swear
not
and
taint
not
thy
soul
with
perjury
have
a
care
for
thine
own
safety
it
is
now
but
the
feeble
barrier
of
thy
tottering
age
which
prevents
all
these
acres
these
fighting
men
these
towers
from
being
my
own
have
a
care
i
say
that
thou
dost
not
lie
as
low
as
he
and
by
my
hand
the
old
man
fell
back
a
pace
affrighted
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
a
fear
fear
of
his
own
son
yet
the
scornful
and
defiant
face
before
him
was
that
of
his
true
child
therein
he
saw
reflected
his
own
turbulent
and
reckless
youth
the
wretched
old
man
covered
his
face
from
the
sight
of
pedro
his
first
born
repose
of
death
and
moaned
aloud
in
his
agony
nay
sorrow
not
my
father
raoul
commanded
harshly
it
was
but
a
weakling
who
stood
next
thy
seat
of
power
behold
i
too
am
thy
son
i
am
stronger
of
a
stouter
heart
abler
and
more
courageous
than
he
and
will
make
thee
a
fitter
heir
didst
thou
not
slay
thy
brother
to
sit
in
his
hall
didst
not
thou
hang
him
to
drink
his
wine
to
command
his
servants
have
i
done
aught
but
follow
thy
example
heedless
of
his
father
s
sobs
raoul
pursued
his
unrelenting
purpose
what
the
sword
did
for
thee
it
has
done
for
me
all
glory
to
the
sword
and
he
raised
the
reeking
blade
to
his
lips
to
kiss
the
elder
man
shrank
away
from
him
as
he
approached
nay
as
i
tell
thee
draw
not
thy
hand
away
turn
not
from
me
or
by
the
blood
of
christ
beside
thy
woman
son
the
puny
changeling
whose
face
now
is
scarce
paler
than
his
blood
was
thin
now
by
the
god
who
made
ye
swear
twill
be
given
out
as
but
an
accident
and
no
man
will
ever
know
from
thee
the
truth
i
swear
i
swear
the
old
man
repeated
piteously
after
his
son
and
so
it
came
to
be
that
raoul
the
second
son
succeeded
his
father
as
lord
of
cartillon
and
thus
is
the
promise
of
the
lord

as
given
in
presence
of
brothers
jehan
and
hubert
only
such
portions
being
here
set
out
saw
you
first
to
invite
you
maurice
met
the
girl
s
smiling
eyes
and
the
ice
of
her
hand
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
come
in
last
night
i
knew
she
was
the
other
woman
you
did
nt
look
at
me
i
can
see
with
my
eyelashes
do
you
know
i
have
often
thought
i
should
love
her
if
i
were
a
man
there
was
not
a
trace
of
jealousy
in
lily
s
gentle
and
perfect
manner
you
resemble
her
said
maurice
you
have
the
blond
head
and
the
same
features
only
a
little
more
delicate
i
have
been
in
her
parlor
all
morning
said
lily
we
talked
about
you
i
am
certain
maurice
mrs
carstang
is
in
her
heart
still
faithful
to
you
that
she
should
thrust
the
old
love
on
him
as
a
kind
of
solace
seemed
the
cruelest
of
all
there
was
no
cognizance
of
anything
except
this
one
maddening
girl
she
absorbed
him
she
wrung
the
strength
of
his
manhood
from
him
as
tribute
such
tribute
as
everybody
a
rock
tranced
by
the
strong
control
which
he
kept
over
himself
i
must
go
said
lily
she
had
not
sat
down
at
all
maurice
shuffled
his
papers
good
bye
she
spoke
good
bye
he
answered
she
did
not
ask
are
you
coming
down
the
trail
with
me
but
ebbed
softly
away
the
swish
of
her
silken
petticoat
subsiding
on
the
grassy
avenue
her
lover
stretched
his
arms
across
the
desk
and
sobbed
upon
them
with
heart
broken
gasps
it
is
killing
me
it
is
killing
me
and
there
is
no
escape
if
i
took
my
life
my
disembodied
ghost
would
follow
her
less
able
to
make
itself
felt
than
now
i
can
not
live
without
her
and
she
is
not
for
me
not
for
me
he
cursed
the
necessity
which
drove
him
out
with
the
sailing
party
and
the
prodigal
waste
of
life
on
neutral
trivial
doings
which
can
not
be
called
living
he
could
see
lily
keeping
down
a
wild
beast
in
him
which
desired
to
toss
overboard
the
men
who
crowded
around
her
she
was
more
deliciously
droll
than
any
comedienne
full
of
music
and
wit
the
kind
of
spirit
that
rises
flood
tide
with
occasion
he
was
himself
hilarious
also
during
this
experience
of
sailing
with
two
queens
surrounded
by
courtiers
and
playing
the
deep
game
of
fascination
as
if
men
were
created
for
the
amusement
of
their
lighter
moments
lily
s
defiant
inscrutable
eyes
mocked
him
but
mrs
carstang
gave
him
sweet
friendship
and
he
sat
by
her
with
the
unchanging
loyalty
of
a
devotee
to
an
altar
from
which
the
sacrament
has
been
removed
next
morning
lily
did
not
come
to
the
lime
kiln
maurice
worked
furiously
all
day
and
corrected
proof
in
his
room
at
night
though
tableaux
were
shown
in
the
casino
both
mrs
carstang
and
lily
being
head
and
front
of
the
undertaking
the
second
day
lily
did
not
come
to
the
limekiln
but
he
saw
her
pass
along
the
grassy
avenue
in
front
of
his
of
them
they
waved
their
hands
to
him
maurice
sat
with
his
head
on
his
desk
all
the
afternoon
beaten
and
broken
hearted
he
told
himself
he
was
a
poltroon
that
he
was
losing
his
manhood
that
the
one
he
loved
despised
him
and
did
well
to
despise
him
that
a
man
of
his
age
who
gave
way
to
such
weakness
must
be
entering
senility
the
habit
of
rectitude
would
cover
him
like
armor
and
proclaim
him
still
of
a
chivalry
to
which
he
felt
recreant
but
it
came
upon
him
like
revelation
that
many
a
man
had
died
of
what
doctors
had
called
disease
when
the
report
to
the
health
officer
should
have
read
this
man
loved
a
woman
with
a
great
passion
and
she
slew
him
the
sigh
of
the
woods
around
and
the
sunlight
searching
for
him
through
his
door
were
lonelier
than
illimitable
space
it
was
what
the
natives
call
a
real
mackinac
day
with
infinite
splendor
of
sky
and
water
maurice
heard
the
rustle
came
through
the
white
waste
of
stones
she
stopped
and
gazed
at
him
with
large
hunted
eyes
and
submitted
to
his
taking
and
kissing
her
hands
it
was
so
blessed
to
have
her
at
all
that
half
his
trouble
fled
before
her
they
sat
down
together
on
the
bench
much
of
his
life
maurice
had
been
in
the
attitude
of
judging
whether
other
people
pleased
him
or
not
lily
reversed
this
habit
of
mind
and
made
him
humbly
solicitous
to
know
whether
he
pleased
her
or
not
he
silently
thanked
god
for
the
mere
privilege
of
having
her
near
him
passionate
selfishness
was
chastened
out
of
him
one
can
say
much
behind
the
lips
and
make
no
sound
at
all
if
i
drench
her
with
my
love
and
she
does
not
know
it
thought
maurice
it
can
not
annoy
her
let
me
take
what
she
is
willing
to
give
and
ask
no
more
the
carstangs
are
gone
said
lily
yes
i
bade
them
good
bye
this
you
do
nt
say
you
regret
their
going
i
never
seek
mrs
carstang
he
sat
holding
the
girl
s
hands
and
never
swerving
a
glance
from
her
face
which
was
weirdly
pallid
the
face
of
her
spirit
he
felt
himself
enveloped
and
possessed
by
her
his
will
subject
to
her
will
he
said
within
himself
voicelessly
i
love
you
i
love
the
firm
chin
the
wilful
lower
lip
and
the
cupid
s
bow
of
the
upper
lip
i
love
the
oval
of
your
cheeks
the
curve
of
your
ears
the
etched
eyebrows
and
all
the
little
curls
on
your
temples
i
love
the
proud
nose
and
most
beautiful
forehead
every
blond
hair
on
that
dear
head
is
mine
its
upward
tilt
on
the
long
throat
is
adorable
have
you
any
gesture
or
personal
trait
which
does
not
thrill
me
but
best
of
all
because
through
them
you
yourself
look
at
me
revealing
more
than
you
think
i
for
a
moment
and
when
he
looked
back
she
was
close
to
him
with
the
infantile
smile
on
her
face
candor
and
sanity
in
her
gray
eyes
involuntarily
he
extended
his
arms
and
she
nestled
within
them
you
will
be
married
freda
he
said
you
will
be
married
and
to
me
he
held
her
tightly
and
kissed
her
lips
but
the
kiss
ended
in
a
crashing
sound
and
a
shock
of
pain
in
his
whole
body
which
expelled
the
breath
from
his
lungs
the
moonlit
island
in
a
blaze
of
light
which
gave
way
to
pitchy
darkness
with
rain
on
his
face
and
whistling
wind
in
his
ears
while
he
clung
with
both
arms
not
to
a
girl
but
to
a
hard
wet
and
cold
mizzentopgallant
yard
whose
iron
jack
stay
had
bumped
him
severely
between
the
eyes
below
him
in
the
darkness
a
scream
rang
out
followed
by
the
roar
of
the
mate
are
you
all
right
up
there
want
any
help
he
had
fallen
four
feet
when
he
could
speak
he
answered
i
m
all
right
sir
and
catching
the
royal
foot
rope
dangling
from
the
end
of
the
yard
above
him
he
brought
it
to
its
place
passed
the
seizing
and
finished
furling
the
royal
but
it
was
a
long
job
his
movements
were
uncertain
for
every
nerve
in
his
body
was
jumping
in
its
own
inharmonious
key
what
s
the
matter
wi
you
up
there
demanded
the
mate
when
he
reached
the
deck
and
was
nothing
sir
i
forgot
about
the
foot
rope
you
re
a
bigger
lunkhead
than
i
thought
go
forrard
he
went
and
when
he
came
aft
at
four
bells
to
take
his
trick
at
the
wheel
the
girl
was
still
on
deck
standing
near
the
companionway
facing
forward
the
mate
stood
at
the
other
side
of
the
binnacle
looking
at
her
with
one
elbow
resting
on
the
house
there
was
just
light
enough
from
the
cabin
skylight
for
owen
to
see
the
expression
which
came
over
his
face
as
he
watched
the
graceful
figure
balancing
to
the
heave
of
the
ship
it
took
on
the
same
evil
look
which
he
had
seen
in
his
fall
while
there
was
no
mistaking
the
thought
behind
the
gleam
in
his
eyes
the
mate
looked
up
into
owen
s
face
and
saw
something
there
which
he
must
have
understood
for
he
dropped
his
glance
to
the
compass
snarled
out
keep
her
on
the
course
and
stepped
into
down
on
the
house
hid
him
from
view
the
girl
approached
the
man
at
the
wheel
i
saw
you
fall
mr
owen
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
and
i
could
not
help
screaming
were
you
hurt
much
no
miss
folsom
he
answered
in
a
low
though
not
a
steady
tone
but
i
was
sadly
disappointed
i
confess
i
was
nervous
very
nervous
when
you
went
aloft
she
said
and
i
cleared
away
the
life
buoy
then
when
you
fell
it
slipped
out
of
my
hand
and
went
overboard
mr
adams
scolded
me
was
nt
it
ridiculous
there
were
tears
and
laughter
in
the
speech
not
at
all
he
said
gravely
it
saved
my
life
for
which
i
thank
you
how
why
who
in
sam
hill
s
been
casting
off
these
gripe
lashings
growled
the
voice
of
the
mate
behind
the
dinghy
at
the
wheel
where
she
patted
the
moving
spokes
pretending
to
assist
him
in
steering
miss
freda
said
the
officer
sternly
as
he
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
i
must
ask
you
plainly
to
let
things
alone
and
another
thing
please
do
nt
talk
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
will
you
please
mind
your
own
business
she
almost
screamed
and
then
crying
and
laughing
together
if
you
paid
as
much
attention
to
your
work
as
you
do
to
to
me
men
would
nt
fall
from
aloft
on
account
of
rotten
foot
ropes
the
abashed
officer
went
forward
grumbling
about
discipline
and
women
aboard
ship
when
he
was
well
out
of
sight
in
the
darkness
the
girl
turned
suddenly
passed
both
arms
around
owen
s
neck
exerted
a
very
slight
pressure
patted
him
playfully
on
the
shoulder
as
she
withdrew
them
and
sped
down
the
companionway
he
steered
a
wild
course
during
he
received
from
the
mate
needs
must
when
the
devil
drives
hogged
at
bow
and
stern
her
deck
sloped
at
the
ends
like
a
truck
s
platform
while
a
slight
twist
in
the
old
hull
canted
the
foremast
to
port
and
the
mizzen
to
starboard
it
would
be
hard
to
know
when
she
was
on
an
even
keel
the
uneven
planking
inboard
and
out
was
scarred
like
a
chopping
block
possibly
from
a
former
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
coal
trade
aloft
were
dingy
gray
spars
slack
hemp
rigging
untarred
for
years
and
tan
colored
sails
mended
with
patch
upon
patch
of
lighter
hued
canvas
that
seemed
about
to
fall
apart
from
their
own
weight
she
was
english
built
bark
rigged
bluff
in
the
bow
square
in
the
stern
unpainted
and
leaky
on
the
whole
as
unkempt
and
disreputable
looking
a
craft
as
ever
flew
the
black
flag
and
with
the
clank
of
the
pumps
marking
time
to
the
wailing
squeak
of
the
tiller
ropes
she
wallowed
through
the
waves
like
a
log
in
an
eddying
tideway
makeshift
slovenly
air
it
was
a
square
section
of
the
bark
s
foreroyal
painted
black
around
the
skull
and
cross
bones
design
which
had
been
left
the
original
hue
of
the
canvas
the
port
holes
were
equally
slovenly
in
appearance
being
cut
through
between
stanchions
with
axes
instead
of
saws
and
the
bulwarks
were
further
disfigured
by
extra
holes
smashed
through
at
the
stanchions
to
take
the
lashings
of
the
gun
breechings
but
the
guns
were
bright
and
cared
for
as
were
the
uniforms
of
the
crew
for
they
had
been
lately
transhipped
far
from
home
with
a
general
cargo
this
ancient
trader
had
been
taken
in
a
fog
by
captain
swarth
and
his
men
