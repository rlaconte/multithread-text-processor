wise
humanity
they
submitted
to
a
condition
in
which
providence
had
placed
them
they
settled
the
question
in
the
deep
foundations
of
the
constitution
would
you
then
sir
destroy
the
fabric
by
undermining
the
constitution
alas
this
would
be
the
consequence
were
it
possible
to
carry
out
the
views
of
the
abolition
party
the
beautiful
words
of
harrison
g
otis
delivered
in
faneuil
hall
boston
aug
d
would
have
been
appropriate
here
too
speaking
of
the
formation
of
anti
slavery
societies
he
said
suppose
an
article
had
been
proposed
to
the
congress
that
framed
the
instrument
of
confederation
proposing
that
the
northern
states
should
be
at
liberty
to
form
anti
slavery
associations
and
deluge
the
south
with
homilies
upon
slavery
how
would
it
have
been
received
the
gentleman
before
me
apostrophized
the
image
of
washington
i
will
follow
his
example
and
point
to
the
portrait
of
his
associate
hancock
which
is
pendant
by
its
side
let
us
imagine
an
interview
between
them
in
the
company
of
friends
just
after
one
had
signed
the
commission
for
the
other
and
in
ruminating
on
the
lights
and
shadows
of
futurity
hancock
should
have
said
i
congratulate
my
country
upon
the
choice
she
has
made
and
i
foresee
that
the
laurels
you
gained
in
the
field
of
braddock
s
defeat
will
be
twined
with
those
which
shall
be
earned
by
you
in
the
war
of
independence
yet
such
are
the
prejudices
in
my
part
of
the
union
against
slavery
that
although
your
name
and
services
may
screen
you
from
opprobrium
during
your
life
your
countrymen
when
millions
weep
over
your
tomb
will
be
branded
by
mine
as
man
stealers
and
murderers
and
the
stain
of
it
consequently
annexed
to
your
memory
but
alas
the
abolitionist
will
not
reflect
he
lives
in
a
whirlpool
whither
he
has
been
drawn
by
his
own
rashness
what
to
him
is
the
love
of
country
or
the
memory
of
washington

randolph
said
i
should
have
been
a
french
atheist
had
not
my
mother
made
me
kneel
beside
her
as
she
folded
my
little
hands
and
taught
me
to
say
our
father
remember
this
mothers
in
america
and
imprint
upon
the
fair
tablet
of
your
young
child
s
heart
a
reverence
for
the
early
institutions
of
their
country
and
for

chapter
xxii
alice
said
mrs
weston
as
they
sat
together
one
morning
before
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
if
you
choose
i
will
read
to
you
the
last
part
of
cousin
janet
s
letter
you
know
my
daughter
of
walter
s
gay
course
in
richmond
and
it
is
as
i
always
feared
there
is
a
tendency
to
recklessness
and
dissipation
in
walter
s
disposition
with
what
a
spirit
of
deep
thankfulness
you
should
review
the
last
few
months
of
your
life
i
have
sometimes
feared
i
was
unjust
to
walter
my
regret
at
the
attachment
for
him
which
you
felt
at
one
time
became
a
personal
dislike
which
i
acknowledge
i
was
wrong
to
yield
to
but
i
think
we
both
acted
naturally
circumstanced
as
we
were
dear
as
you
are
to
me
i
would
rather
see
you
dead
than
the
victim
of
an
unhappy
marriage
love
is
not
blind
as
many
say
i
believe
the
stronger
one
s
love
is
the
more
palpable
the
errors
of
its
object
it
was
so
with
me
and
it
would
be
so
with
you
that
you
have
conquered
this
attachment
is
the
crowning
blessing
of
my
life
even
should
you
choose
never
to
consummate
your
engagement
with
arthur
i
will
at
least
thank
god
that
you
are
not
the
wife
of
a
man
whose
violent
passions
even
as
a
child
could
not
be
controlled
and
who
is
destitute
of
a
spark
of
religious
principle
i
will
now
read
you
what
cousin
janet
says
i
have
received
a
long
letter
from
mr
c
the
episcopal
clergyman
in
richmond
in
answer
to
mine
inquiring
of
walter
all
that
i
feared
is
true
walter
is
not
only
gay
but
dissipated
mr
c
says
he
has
called
to
see
him
repeatedly
and
invited
him
to
his
house
and
has
done
all
that
he
could
to
interest
him
in
those
pleasures
that
are
innocent
and
ennobling
but
alas
it
is
difficult
to
lay
aside
the
wine
cup
when
its
intoxicating
touch
is
familiar
to
the
lips
and
so
of
the
other
forbidden
pleasures
of
life
to
one
of
walter
s
temperament
there
is
two
fold
danger
walter
is
gambling
too
and
bets
high
he
will
of
course
be
a
prey
to
the
more
experienced
ones
who
will
take
advantage
of
his
youth
and
generosity
to
rob
him
for
is
a
professed
gambler
better
than
a
common
thief
it
is
needless
for
me
to
say
i
have
shed
many
tears
over
this
letter
tears
are
for
the
living
and
i
expect
to
shed
them
while
i
wear
this
garment
of
mortality
can
it
be
that
in
this
case
the
wise
creator
will
visit
the
sins
of
the
father
upon
the
child
are
are
all
my
tears
and
prayers
to
fail
i
cannot
think
so
while
he
reigns
in
heaven
in
the
same
body
with
which
he
suffered
on
earth
in
the
very
hand
that
holds
the
sceptre
is
the
print
of
the
nails
under
the
royal
crown
that
encircles
his
brow
can
still
be
traced
the
marks
of
the
thorns
he
is
surely
then
touched
with
a
feeling
of
our
infirmities
and
he
will
in
the
end
bring
home
this
child
of
my
love
and
my
adoption
i
often
say
to
myself
could
i
see
alice
and
arthur
and
walter
happy
how
happy
should
i
be
i
would
be
more
than
willing
to
depart
but
there
would
be
still
a
care
for
something
in
this
worn
out
and
withered
frame
it
will
be
far
better
to
be
with
jesus
but
he
will
keep
me
here
as
long
as
he
apron
the
shining
curls
she
looked
on
with
a
malicious
smile
while
they
crisped
and
blackened
in
the
glowing
lehigh
fire
but
miserable
as
were
the
week
days
sunday
after
all
was
the
dreadful
day
for
katy
the
long
long
long
sunday
when
every
book
in
the
house
was
put
un
der
lock
and
key
when
even
religious
newspapers
tracts
and
memoirs
were
tabooed
when
the
old
people
who
fancied
they
could
not
go
to
church
sat
from
sunrise
to
sunset
in
their
best
clothes
with
their
hands
folded
looking
speechlessly
into
the
fire
when
there
was
no
dinner
when
the
irish
girl
and
the
cat
equally
lawless
and
heretical
went
to
see
their
friends
when
not
a
sound
was
heard
in
the
house
save
the
ticking
of
the
old
claw
footed
clock
that
stood
in
the
entry
when
katy
crept
up
to
her
room
and
crouching
in
a
corner
wondered
if
god
was
good
why
he
let
her
papa
die
and
why
he
did
not
help
her
mamma
who
tried
so
hard
to
earn
money
to
bring
her
home
the
last
bright
golden
beam
of
the
sabbath
sun
had
slowly
faded
away
one
by
one
the
stars
came
gliding
out
he
who
held
them
all
in
their
places
listening
ever
to
the
ceaseless
music
of
their
motion
yet
bent
a
pitying
ear
to
the
stifled
sob
of
a
troubled
child
softly
sweetly
fell
the
gentle
dew
of
slumber
on
weary
eyelids
while
angels
came
to
minister
tears
glittered
still
on
katy
s
long
lashes
but
the
little
lips
parted
with
a
smile
murmuring
papa
sleep
on
dream
on
little
katy
he
who
noteth
the
sparrow
s
fall
hath
given
his
angels
charge
to
keep
thee
chapter
lxvii
in
one
of
the
thousand
business
offices
in
one
of
the
thousand
crowded
streets
of
a
neighboring
city
sat
mr
john
walter
with
his
legs
crossed
his
right
finger
pressed
against
the
right
lobe
of
his
organ
of
causality
his
right
elbow
resting
on
his
right
knee
and
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
beating
a
sort
of
tattoo
on
a
fresh
copy
of
the
standard
which
lay
upon
the
table
by
his
side
his
attitude
was
one
of
profound
meditation
who
can
she
be
exclaimed
mr
walter
in
a
tone
of
blended
interest
and
vexation
who
can
she
be
mr
walter
raised
his
head
uncrossed
his
legs
took
up
the
standard
and
re
read
floy
s
last
article
slowly
often
pausing
to
analyze
the
sentences
as
though
he
would
extort
from
them
some
hidden
meaning
to
serve
as
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
author
after
he
had
perused
the
article
thus
searchingly
he
laid
down
the
standard
and
again
exclaimed
who
can
she
be
she
is
a
genius
certainly
whoever
she
is
continued
he
soliloquizingly
a
bitter
life
experience
she
has
had
too
she
did
not
draw
upon
her
imagination
for
this
article
like
the
very
first
production
of
her
pen
that
i
read
it
is
a
wail
from
her
inmost
soul
so
are
many
of
her
pieces
a
few
dozen
of
them
taken
consecutively
would
form
a
whole
history
of
wrong
and
suffering
and
bitter
sorrow
what
a
singular
being
she
must
be
if
i
have
formed
a
correct
opinion
of
her
what
powers
of
endurance
what
an
elastic
strong
brave
loving
fiery
yet
soft
and
winning
nature
a
bundle
of
contradictions
and
how
famously
she
has
got
on
too
it
is
only
a
little
more
than
a
year
since
her
first
piece
was
published
and
now
her
articles
flood
the
whole
country
i
seldom
take
up
an
exchange
which
does
not
contain
one
or
more
of
them
that
first
piece
of
hers
was
a
stroke
of
genius
a
real
gem
although
not
very
smoothly
polished
ever
since
i
read
it
i
have
been
trying
to
find
out
the
author
s
name
and
have
watched
her
career
with
eager
interest
her
career
i
say
for
i
suppose
floy
to
be
a
woman
notwithstanding
the
rumors
to
the
contrary
at
any
rate
my
wife
says
so
and
women
have
an
instinct
about
such
things
i
wish
i
knew
whether
she
gets
well
paid
for
her
writings
probably
not
inexperienced
writers
seldom
get
more
than
a
mere
pittance
there
are
so
many
ready
to
write
poor
fools
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
thing
and
there
are
so
many
ready
to
take
advantage
of
this
fact
and
withhold
from
needy
talent
the
moral
right
to
a
deserved
remuneration
thank
heaven
i
have
never
practiced
this
the
household
messenger
does
not
yield
me
a
very
large
income
but
what
it
does
yield
is
fairly
earned
why
bless
me
exclaimed
mr
walter
suddenly
starting
up
and
as
suddenly
sitting
down
again
why
has
not
this
idea
occurred
to
me
before
yes
why
not
engage
floy
to
write
for
the
household
messenger
how
i
wish
i
were
rich
that
i
might
give
her
such
a
price
as
she
really
deserves
let
me
see
she
now
writes
for
the
standard
and
the
pilgrim
four
pieces
a
week
for
each
eight
pieces
in
all
that
is
too
much
work
for
her
to
begin
with
she
cannot
do
herself
justice
she
ought
not
to
write
at
the
outside
more
than
two
pieces
a
week
then
she
could
polish
them
up
and
strengthen
them
and
render
them
as
nearly
perfect
in
execution
as
they
are
in
conception
one
piece
a
week
would
be
as
much
as
i
should
wish
could
i
possibly
afford
to
pay
her
as
much
or
more
for
that
one
piece
as
she
now
gets
for
eight
her
name
is
a
tower
of
strength
but
its
influence
would
be
frittered
away
were
she
to
write
for
more
than
one
paper
if
i
could
secure
her
pen
all
to
myself
the
advertising
that
such
a
connection
would
give
the
messenger
would
be
worth
something
ah
me
were
my
purse
only
commensurate
with
my
feelings
if
i
only
knew
who
floy
is
and
could
have
him
how
plausible
were
the
excuses
that
arose
in
her
mind
and
now
where
had
they
fled
the
very
power
of
speech
seemed
abandoning
her
she
almost
longed
for
some
taunting
word
another
cold
sneer
at
least
they
would
have
stung
her
into
eloquence
but
that
dull
quiet
silence
chained
up
her
faculties
she
sat
gazing
on
the
floor
mute
and
pale
and
he
remained
in
his
seat
coldly
regarding
her
at
length
the
stillness
grew
irksome
to
him
i
am
waiting
patiently
ada
waiting
to
hear
why
you
abandoned
your
husband
she
started
her
eye
kindled
and
the
fiery
blood
flashed
into
her
cheek
i
did
not
abandon
my
husband
he
left
me
for
a
journey
but
for
a
journey
was
the
calm
reply
yes
such
journeys
as
you
had
taken
before
and
with
a
like
motive
leaving
me
young
penniless
beset
with
temptation
tortured
with
jealousy
on
that
very
journey
you
had
a
companion
she
looked
at
him
as
if
eager
even
then
against
her
own
positive
knowledge
to
hear
a
denial
of
her
accusations
but
he
only
smiled
and
murmured
softly
yes
yes
i
remember
it
was
a
pleasant
journey
it
drove
me
wild
i
was
not
myself
suspicions
such
suspicions
haunted
me
i
thought
i
believed
nay
believe
now
that
you
wished
me
to
go
that
you
longed
to
get
rid
of
me
nay
that
you
encouraged
i
cannot
frame
words
for
the
thought
even
now
he
had
lent
you
money
large
sums
william
william
in
the
name
of
heaven
tell
me
that
it
was
not
for
this
i
was
left
alone
in
debt
and
helpless
say
that
you
did
not
yourself
thrust
me
into
that
terrible
temptation
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
grasped
it
hard
her
eyes
searched
his
to
the
soul
he
smiled
her
hand
dropped
her
countenance
fell
and
oh
such
bitter
disappointment
broke
through
her
voice
it
has
been
the
vulture
preying
on
my
heart
ever
since
a
word
would
have
torn
it
away
but
you
will
not
take
the
trouble
even
to
deceive
me
you
smile
only
smile
i
only
smile
at
the
absurdity
of
your
suspicion
she
looked
up
eagerly
but
with
doubt
in
her
face
she
panted
to
believe
him
but
lacked
the
necessary
faith
i
asked
him
to
deny
this
on
his
death
bed
and
he
could
not
then
he
is
dead
was
the
quick
rejoinder
he
is
dead
yes
he
is
dead
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
and
the
daughter
his
heiress
she
too
is
dead
he
longed
to
ask
another
question
his
eyes
absolutely
gleamed
with
eagerness
but
his
self
control
was
wonderful
a
direct
question
might
expose
the
unutterable
meanness
of
his
hope
he
must
obtain
what
he
panted
to
know
by
circuitous
means
and
you
staid
by
him
to
the
last
she
turned
upon
him
a
sharp
and
penetrating
look
he
felt
the
whole
force
of
her
glance
and
assumed
an
expression
well
calculated
to
deceive
a
much
less
excitable
observer
i
thought
he
said
that
you
had
been
living
in
retirement
that
you
left
the
noble
villain
without
public
disgrace
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
for
me
to
know
this
i
did
leave
him
i
did
live
in
retirement
toiled
for
my
own
bread
by
wrestling
with
poverty
i
strove
to
win
back
some
portion
of
content
yet
you
were
with
him
when
he
died
it
was
a
mournful
death
bed
he
sent
for
me
and
i
went
oh
it
was
a
mournful
death
bed
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
she
covered
her
face
with
both
hands
i
had
been
the
governess
of
his
daughter
her
nurse
in
the
last
sickness
and
you
lived
apart
alone
you
and
this
daughter
she
died
in
florence
we
were
alone
she
was
sent
home
for
burial
and
to
be
a
governess
to
this
young
lady
you
abandoned
your
own
child
only
to
be
governess
can
you
say
to
me
ada
that
it
was
only
to
be
a
governess
to
this
young
lady
there
was
feeling
in
his
voice
something
of
stern
dignity
perhaps
at
the
moment
he
did
feel
she
thought
so
and
it
gave
her
hope
she
had
not
removed
her
hands
they
still
covered
her
face
and
a
faint
murmur
only
broke
through
the
fingers
oh
what
cowards
sin
makes
of
us
that
poor
woman
dared
not
tell
the
truth
she
shrunk
from
uttering
a
positive
falsehood
hence
the
humiliating
murmur
that
stole
from
her
pallid
lips
the
sickening
shudder
that
ran
through
her
frame
you
do
not
answer
said
the
husband
for
leicester
was
her
husband
you
do
not
answer
she
had
gathered
courage
enough
to
utter
the
falsehood
and
dropping
her
hands
replied
in
a
firm
voice
disagreeably
firm
for
the
lie
cost
her
proud
spirit
a
terrible
effort
and
she
could
not
utter
it
naturally
as
he
would
have
done
yes
i
can
answer
it
was
to
be
the
young
lady
s
governess
that
i
went
only
to
be
her
governess
penniless
abandoned
what
else
could
i
do
he
did
not
believe
her
in
his
soul
he
knew
that
she
was
not
speaking
the
truth
but
there
was
something
yet
to
learn
and
in
the
end
it
might
be
policy
to
feign
a
belief
which
he
could
not
feel
so
after
wasting
youth
and
talent
on
his
daughter
paling
your
beauty
over
her
death
bed
and
his
this
pitiful
man
could
leave
you
to
poverty
and
toil
did
he
expect
that
i
would
receive
you
again
after
that
suspicious
desertion
no
no
the
wild
thought
was
mine
you
once
loved
me
william
the
tears
were
swelling
in
her
eyes
again
few
men
could
have
resisted
the
look
of
those
eyes
the
sweet
pleading
of
her
voice
for
the
contrast
with
her
usual
imperious
pride
had
something
very
touching
in
it
you
were
very
beautiful
then
he
said
very
beautiful
and
am
i
so
much
changed
she
answered
with
a
smile
of
gentle
sweetness
in
his
secret
heart
sent
this
afternoon
but
about
two
hours
ago
he
came
to
me
and
declared
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
would
not
part
with
them
i
offered
double
the
original
amount
but
he
said
money
was
no
inducement
i
strove
to
borrow
or
hire
for
any
given
time
but
every
proposal
was
peremptorily
declined
and
as
it
is
impossible
to
leave
here
i
came
over
to
entreat
you
to
remain
with
my
sister
at
least
for
a
few
days
till
we
can
determine
what
is
advisable
to
do
his
proposal
was
accepted

assumed

in

to

stationed
on
the
observatory
of

fortress
a
sentinel
paced
to

fro
on
the
flat
roof
of
the
gray
old
church
having
orders
to
give
instant
alarm
in

by
the
ringing
of

bells
silver
haired
men
bending
beneath

along

augured

in

silent

anxiously
the

awaited

on

breeze
with
throbbing
hearts

inhabitants
gathered
about
their
doors
and
strained
their
eyes
toward
the
south
a
large
body
of
mexicans
availing
themselves
of
the
cover
of
night
sallied
from
the
alamo
hoping
to
cut
off
a
squad
of
ninety
two
men
who
leaving
the
main
body
of
the
texan
army
had
advanced
for
the
purpose
of
reconnoitering
and
were
posted
at
the
old
mission
of
conception
some
two
miles
below
the
town
and
here
the
contest
was
waged
the
watchman
on
the
church
listened
intently
as
each
report
reached
his
ear
and
kept
his
fingers
firmly
on
the
bell
rope
an
hour
passed
on
and
the
sun
rode
high
in
heaven
gradually
the
thundering
died
away
quicker
grew
the
breathing
and
tighter
the
cold
fingers
clasped

other
the
last
sound
ceased
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
throughout
the
town
and
many
a
cheek
grew
colorless
as
marble
there
came
a
confused
sound
of
shouts
the
mingling
of
many
voices
the
distant
tramp
of
cavalry
and
then
there
fell
on
the
aching
ears
the
deep
thrilling
tones
of
the
church
bells
an
intervening
bend
in
the
river
was
quickly
passed
and
a
body
of
mexican
cavalry
dashed
at
full
gallop
across
the
plain
nor
slackened
their
pace
till
secure
behind
the
somber
walls
of
the
alamo
at
intervals
of
every
few
moments
small
squads
pushed
in
then
a
running
band
of
infantry
and
lastly
a
solitary
horseman
reeling
in
his
saddle
dripping
with
gore
madly
his
wounded
horse
sprung
on
when
just
as
the
fort
was
gained
his
luckless
rider
rolled
senseless
at
the
entrance
one
deep
groan
was
echoed
from
church
to

precision
they
lifted
their

and
artillerymen
and
officers
rolled
together
in
the
dust
the
brave
little
band
conquered
and
the
flying
mexicans
left
them
sole
masters
of
the
field
of
the
horseshoe
on
the
hill
which
rose
just
beyond
the

stood
in
bold
relief
against
the
eastern
sky
a
tall
square
building
to
which
the
sobriquet
of
powder
house

applied
here
as
a
means
of
increased
vigilance
was
placed
a
body
of
horse
for
the
purpose
of
watching
the
plain
which
stretched
along
the
river
fearing
every
moment
to
see
the
victorious
texans
at
the
heels
of
their
retreating
infantry
they
had
orders
to
dash
in
at
the
first
glimpse
of
the
advance
guard
of
the
enemy
but
night
closed
and
none
appeared
and
dreading
the
morning
light
many
lay
down
to
sleep
at
the
close
of
that
eventful
day
several
hours
elapsed
and
then
the
texan
forces
under
general
burleson
wound
across
the
valley
and
settled
along
the
verge
of
the
town
the

was
beleaguered
forced
as
it
were
to
remain
a
witness
of
the
horrors
of
the
then
approaching
conflict
the
cousins
strove
to
cast
from
them
the
gloomy
forebodings
which
crept
into
their
hearts
darkening
the
present
and
investing
the
future
with
phantoms
of
terror
mrs
carlton
and
mary
were
far
more
hopeful
than
the
remainder
of
the
little
circle
and
kept
up
the
semblance
of
cheerfulness
which
ever
flies
at
the
approach
of
danger
the
girls
saw
but
little
of
the
gentlemen

out
in

entreaties

enlisted
immediately
after
general
burleson

arrival
his
manner
during
his
brief
visits
was
considerate
and
kind
yet
mary
fancied
at
times
that
he
avoided
her
though
marking
her
declining
health
he
had
prescribed
some
simple
remedy
and
never
failed
to
inquire
if
she
were
not
improving
in
taking
it
but
thanks
to
that
overruling
power
in
whose
hands
we
all
are
i
have
been
most
mysteriously
preserved
from
setting
the
seal
upon
my
own
wretchedness
i
see
you
are
incredulous
but
there
is
one
here
who
feels
that
i
speak
the
truth
exonerated
in
her
eyes
i
can
bear
the
fate
which
in
all
probability
awaits
me

raised
helen
s
hand
to
his
lips
fervently
pressed
it
replaced
it
on
her
lap
and
folding
his
arms
he
signified
his
readiness
to
accompany
them
wherever
they
wished
the
sympathies
of
mr
forrester
s
family
were
with
him
for
they
knew
all
he
had
borne
and
they
believed
his
solemn
assertion
of
his
innocence
of
the
crime
but
it
was
not
thus
with
the
remainder
of
the
company
they
regarded
the
scene
they
had
just
witnessed
as
well
got
up
for
effect
but
their
conviction
of
clinton

guilt
remained
unshaken
his
captors
congratulated
each

that
court

then
sitting
in
the
county
seat

the
criminal
could
be
summarily
dealt
with
before

at

audacious
crime

permit
her

exhausted
by
the
variety
of
emotions
she
had
contended

many

conveyed
to
bellevue

she
was
placed
in

summoned

over
this
young
martyr

aggrandizement
helen
lay
white
and
motionless
for
hours
with
no
sign
of
intelligence
or
suffering
save
an
occasional
tear
that
welled
from
the
half
closed
eyes
betraying
that
amidst
the
aberration
of
intellect
caused
by
the
fever
which
burned
in
her
veins
she
was
still
conscious
of
the
mighty
weight
of
misery
that
lay
as
a
burden
on
her
soul
on
the
morning
after
the
murder
the
body
of
hilton
was
brought
to
bellevue
for
interment
attended
by
a
large
concourse
of
persons
his
remains
were
conveyed
to
their
last
resting
place
and
now
all
that
remained
to
consummate
the
tragedy
was
to
bring
speedy
punishment
to
the
perpetrator
of
the
deed
though
hilton
had
not
been
a
popular
man
the
circumstances
of
his
death
awoke
a
wide
spread
feeling
of
indignation
and
speedy
retribution
to
the
author
of
his
fate
was
the
universal
wish
clinton
was
a
stranger
and
there
was
no
one
to
raise
a
voice
in
his
behalf
save
mr
forrester
and
his
new
son
the
latter
too
little
known
in
the
neighborhood
himself
to
have
much
influence
the
minds
of
all
men
in
the
community
were
decided
as
to
the
question
of
the
prisoner
s
guilt
and
since
he
must
die
why
prolong
the
tortures
of
suspense
let
him
be
condemned
at
once
and
the
demands
of
justice
satisfied
through
the
powerful
influence
of
hilton
s
connections
the
trial
was
hurried
on
for
there
was
no
one
to
insist
that
in
the
excited
state
of
public
feeling
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
an
unprejudiced
jury
clinton
s
guilt
appeared
to
be
so
clear
and
palpable
that
this
was
scarcely
deemed
of
great
importance
he
was
tried
within
a
few
days
after
the
murder
he
adhered
to
the
statement
he
had
already
made
but
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
against
him
it
was
received
with
universal
disbelief
sentence
was
pronounced
against
him
death
and
but
one
week
given
to
prepare
for
the
awful
change
the
prisoner
heard
his
doom
with
calmness
and
returned
to
his
cell
to
write
to
his
friends
and
inform
them
of
the
terrible
fate
which
hung
over
him
this
accomplished
he
took
up
his
pen
to
address
helen
but
his
courage
failed
him
what
could
he
say
to
console
the
stricken
one
she
believed
him
innocent
for
he
knew
that
his
solemn
assurance
in
that
last
heart
rending
interview
had
carried
conviction
to
her
at
least
the
time
must
arrive
when
his
name
would
be
vindicated
from
this
imputation
but
too
late
to
save
him
from
its
penalty
and
she
would
probably
perish
a
victim
to
her
sorrowful
fate
before
that
hour
rolled
around
he
did
not
ask
for
prolonged
life
for
her
could
he
have
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
thus
have
gone
to
meet
the
award
of
the
deeds
done
on
earth
he
would
have
welcomed
death
but
to
leave
helen
to
the
loneliness
of
her
anguish
was
a
terrible
thought
he
heard
of
her
illness
with
joy
and
really
hoped
that
before
the
knowledge
of
his
unhappy
doom
could
reach
her
she
would
be
forever
at
rest
the
news
of
clinton
s
condemnation
soon
reached
bellevue
helen
still
lay
apparently
in
the
same
dreamy
half
unconscious
state
though
her
physical
powers
did
not
seem
to
waste
away
beneath
the
sufferings
of
her
mind
after
the
third
day
of
her
illness
she
did
not
refuse
food
when
it
was
offered
for
she
wished
to
regain
her
usual
strength
as
the
mind
struggled
back
to
consciousness
a
restless
feeling
awoke
within
it
that
on
her
depended
the
preservation
of
her
lover
to
her
would
be
given
the
power
to
atone
to
him
for
all
the
anguish
she
had
an
undue
regard
for
lena
why
should
he
wish
to
see
her
the
wife
of
another
and
that
other
his
son
was
it
his
better
and
nobler
nature
struggling
to
save
her
from
evil
which
prompted
the
wish
durward
hoped
so
he
believed
so
and
the
confidence
which
had
so
recently
been
shaken
was
fully
restored
when
by
the
light
of
the
hall
lamp
at
home
he
saw
how
white
and
almost
ghostly
was
the
face
which
ere
they
entered
the
drawing
room
turned
imploringly
upon
him
asking
him
to
be
careful
mrs
graham
had
been
in
a
fit
of
the
sulks
ever
since
the
morning
of
mrs
livingstone
s
call
and
now
though
she
had
not
seen
her
husband
for
several
days
she
merely
held
out
her
hand
turning
her
head
meantime
and
replying
to
his
questions
in
a
low
quiet
kind
of
a
much
injured
woman
way
as
provoking
as
it
was
uncalled
for
father

suggestion

one

beautiful

in

will
propose
to
her
at
once
and
she
will
thus
be
out
of
danger

what
should
he
do
with
her
should
he
bring
her
there
to
woodlawn
where
scarcely
a
day
passed
without
some
domestic
storm
no
his
home
should
be
full
of
sunlight
of
music
and
flowers
where
no
angry
word
or
darkening
frown
could
ever
find
entrance
and
thus
dreaming
of
a
blissful
future
when
lena
should
be
his
bride

it

not

an
individual

very
important
personage

still
in
some
degree
connected
with

with

assembled
in

john

returned
and
purposely
telling
his
mother
and
carrie
whom
he
had
left
with
lena
had
succeeded
in
putting
them
both
into
an
uncomfortable
humor
the
latter
secretly
lamenting
the
mistake
which
she
had
committed
in
suffering
lena
to
stay
with
mabel
but
it
could
not
be
remedied
now
there
was
no
good
reason
for
calling
her
home

broke
at
least
three
cambric
needles
in
her
vigorous
jerks
at
the
handkerchief
she
was
hemming
a
heavy
tread
upon
the
piazza
a
loud
ring
of
the
bell
and
carrie
straightened
up
thinking
it
might
possibly
be
durward
who
had
called
on
his
way
home
but
the
voice
was
strange
and
rather
impatiently
she
waited
does
mr
john
livingstone
live
here
asked
the
stranger
of
the
negro
who
answered
the
summons
yes
sir
answered
the
servant
eyeing
the
new
comer
askance
and
is
old
miss
nichols
and
helleny
to
hum
the
negro
grinned
answering
in
the
affirmative
and
asking
the
young
man
to
walk
in
wall
guess
i
will
said
he
advancing
a
few
steps
toward
the
parlor
door
then
suddenly
halting
he
added
more
to
himself
than
to
the
negro
darned
if
i
do
nt
go
the
hull
figger
and
send
in
my
card
as
they
do
to
boston
so
saying
he
drew
from
his
pocket
an
embossed
card
and
bending
his
knee
for
a
table
he
wrote
with
sundry
nourishes
mr
joel
slocum
esq
slocumville
massachusetts
there
hand
that
to
your
boss
said
he
and
tell
him
i
m
out
in
the
entry
at
the
same
time
he
stepped
before
the
hat
stand
rubbing
up
his
oily
hair
and
thinking
mr
joel
slocum
would
make
an
impression
anywhere
who
is
it
ben
whispered
carrie
dunno
miss
said
the
negro
passing
the
card
to
his
master
and
waiting
in
silence
for
his
orders
mr
joel
slocum
esq
slocumville
massachusetts
slowly
read
mr
livingstone
wondering
where
he
had
heard
that
name
before
who
simultaneously
asked
carrie
and
anna
while
their
mother
looked
wonderingly
up
instantly
john
jr
remembered
lena
s
love
letter
and
anticipating
fun
exclaimed
show
him
in
ben
show
him
in
while
ben
is
showing
him
in
we
will
introduce
him
more
fully
to
our
readers
promising
that
the
picture
is
not
overdrawn
but
such
as
we
saw
it
in
our
native
state
joel
belonged
to
that
extreme
class
of
yankees
with
which
we
sometimes
though
not
often
meet
brought
up
among
the
new
england
mountains
he
was
almost
wholly
ignorant
of
what
really
belonged
to
good
manners
fancying
that
he
knew
everything
and
sneering
at
those
of
his
acquaintance
who
being
of
a
more
quiet
turn
of
mind
were
content
to
settle
down
in
the
home
of
their
fathers
caring
little
or
nothing
for
the
world
without
but
as
for
him
he
was
bound
he
said
to
see
the
elephant
and
if
his
brothers
were
green
enough
to
stay
tied
to
their
mother
s
apron
strings
they
might
do
it
but
he
would
nt
no
sir
he
was
going
to
make
something
of
himself
to
effect
this
about
two
years
before
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
he
went
to
boston
to
learn
the
art
of
daguerreotype
taking
in
which
he
really
did
seem
to
excel
returning
home
with
some
money
a
great
deal
of
vanity
and
a
strong
propensity
to
boast
of
what
he
had
seen
recollections
of
lena
his
early
and
as
he
sentimentally
expressed
it
his
undying
all
enduring
love
still
haunted
him
and
at
last
he
determined
upon
a
tour
to
kentucky
purchasing
for
the
occasion
a
rather
fantastic
suit
consisting
of
greenish
pants
blue
coat
red
vest
and
yellow
neck
handkerchief
these
he
laid
carefully
by
in
his
trunk
until
he
reached
lexington
where
he
intended
stopping
for
a
time
hanging
out
a
naming
sign
which
announced
his
presence
and
capabilities
after
spending
a
few
days
in
the
city
endeavoring
to
impress
its
inhabitants
with
a
sense
of
his
consequence
and
mentally
styling
them
all
know
nothings
be
cause
they
did
not
seem
to
be
a
state
of
the
most
perfect
composure
the
singular
terror
of
her
father
and
the
boldness
and
assurance
of
the
intruder
were
to
miss
stevens
something
inexplicable
she
stood
looking
from
one
to
the
other
as
though
seeking
an
explanation
and
on
observing
symptoms
of
a
return
to
consciousness
on
the
part
of
her
parent
she
turned
to
mccloskey
and
said
appealingly
you
see
how
your
presence
has
agitated
my
father
pray
let
me
conjure
you
go
be
your
errand
what
it
may
i
promise
you
it
shall
have
the
earliest
attention
or
said
she
tell
me
what
it
is
perhaps
i
can
see
to
it
i
attend
a
great
deal
to
father
s
business
pray
tell
me
no
no
exclaimed
the
old
man
who
had
caught
the
last
few
words
of
his
daughter
no
no
not
a
syllable
here
i
m
well
i
m
well
enough
i
ll
attend
to
you
there
there
that
will
do
he
continued
addressing
the
servant
leave
the
room
and
you
he
added
turning
to
his
daughter
do
you
go
too
i
am
much
better
now
and
can
talk
to
him
go
go
he
cried
impatiently
as
he
saw
evidences
of
a
disposition
to
linger
on
her
part
if
i
want
you
i
ll
ring
go
this
person
wo
nt
stay
long
not
if
i
get
what
i
came
for
miss
said
mccloskey
insolently
otherwise
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
i
may
stay
with
a
look
of
apprehension
lizzie
quitted
the
room
and
the
murderer
and
his
accomplice
were
alone
together
mr
stevens
reached
across
the
table
drew
the
liquor
towards
him
and
recklessly
pouring
out
a
large
quantity
drained
the
glass
to
the
bottom
this
seemed
to
nerve
him
up
and
give
him
courage
for
he
turned
to
mccloskey
and
said
with
a
much
bolder
air
than
he
had
yet
shown
in
addressing
him
so
you
re
back
again
villain
are
you
i
thought
and
hoped
you
were
dead
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
some
horrid
spectre
i
ve
been
divilish
near
it
squire
but
providence
has
preserved
me
ye
see
jist
to
be
a
comfort
to

and
hope

good
dale
of

this
many
years

mr
stevens
glared
at
him
fiercely
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
rejoined
you
promised
me
solemnly
five
years
ago
that
you
would
never
trouble
me
again
and
i
gave
you
money
enough
to
have
kept
you
in
comfort
ay
luxury
for
the
remainder
of
your
life
where
is
it
all
now
that
s
more
than
i
can
tell
you
squire
i
only

how
it

i
do

trouble
myself
how
it

bookkeeper
for

he

quarterly
account
and
then
it
wo
nt
come
on
ye
so
sudden
when
it
s
all
out
another
time
insolent
muttered
mr
stevens
mccloskey
gave
mr
stevens
an
impudent
look
but
beyond
that
took
no
farther
notice
of
his
remark
but
proceeded
with
the
utmost
coolness
to
pour
out
another
glass
of
brandy
after
which
he
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
grate
and
placed
his
dirty
feet
upon
the
mantelpiece
in
close
proximity
to
an
alabaster
clock
you
make
yourself
very
much
at
home
said
stevens
indignantly
why
should
nt
i
answered
his
tormentor
in
a
tone
of
the
most
perfect
good
humour
why
should
nt
i
in
the
house
of
an
ould
acquaintance
and
particular
friend
just
the
place
to
feel
at
home
eh
stevens
then
folding
his
arms
and
tilting
back
his
chair
he
asked
coolly
you
have
nt
a
cigar
have
ye
no
replied
stevens
surlily
and
if
i
had
you
should
not
have
it
your
insolence
is
unbearable
you
appear
continued
he
with
some
show
of
dignity
to
have
forgotten
who
i
am
and
who
you
are
ye
re
mistaken
there
squire
divil
a
bit

i
i

mccloskey
and
you
are
slippery
george
an
animal
that

known
over
the
varsal
world
as
a
philadelphia
lawyer
a
man
that

chated
his
hundreds
and
if
he
lives
long
enough
he
ll
chate
as
many
more
savin
his
friend
mr
mccloskey
and
him
he
ll
not
be
afther
chating
because
he
wo
nt
be
able
to
get
a
chance
although
he
d
like
to
if
he
could
divil
a
doubt
of
that
it
s
false
i
never
tried
to
cheat
you
rejoined
stevens
courageously
for
the
liquor

beginning
to
have
a
very
inspiriting
effect
it
s
a
lie
i
paid
you
all
i
agreed
upon
and
more
besides
but
you
are
like
a
leech
never
satisfied
you

had
from
me
altogether
nearly
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
you
ll
not
get
much
more
now
mind
i
tell
you
the
divil
i
wo

rejoined
he
angrily
that
is
yet
to
be
seen
how
would
you
like
to
make
yer
appearance
at
court
some
fine
morning
on
the
charge
of
murther
eh
mr
stevens
gave
a
perceptible
shudder
and
looked
round
whereupon
mccloskey
said
with
a
malevolent
grin
ye
see
i
do
nt
stick
at
words
squire
i
call
things
by
their
names
so
i
perceive
answered
stevens
you
were
not
so
bold
once
ha
ha
laughed
mccloskey
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
then
i
was
under
the
thumb
that
was
before
we
were
sailing
in
the
one
boat
now
ye
see
squire
the
boot
is
on
the
other
leg
mr
stevens
remained
quiet
for
a
few
moments
whilst
his
ragged
visitor
continued
to
leisurely
sip
his
brandy
and
contemplate
the
soles
of
his
boots
as
they
were
reflected
in
the
mirror
above
they
were
a
from
other
neighbors
dwelt
the
friends
of
herbert
greyson
the
widow
rocke
and
her
son
traverse
no
one
knew
who
she
was
or
whence
or
why
she
came
some
fifteen
years
before
she
had
appeared
in
town
clothed
in
rusty
mourning
and
accompanied
by
a
boy
of
about
two
years
of
age
she
had
rented
that
cottage
furnished
it
poorly
and
had
settled
there
supporting
herself
and
child
by
needlework
at
the
time
that
doctor
greyson
died
and
his
widow
and
son
were
left
perfectly
destitute
and
it
became
necessary
for
mrs
greyson
to
look
out
for
a
humble
lodging
where
she
could
find
the
united
advantages
of
cheapness
cleanliness
and
pure
air
she
was
providentially
led
to
inquire
at
the
cottage
of
the
widow
rocke
whom
she
found
only
too
glad
to
increase
her
meager
income
by
letting
half
her
little
house
to
such
unexceptionable
tenants
as
the
widow
greyson
and
her
son
and
thus
commenced
between
the
two
poor
young
women
and
the
two
boys
an
acquaintance
that
ripened
into
friendship
and
thence
into
that
devoted
love
so
seldom
seen
in
this
world
their
households
became
united
one
fire
one
candle
and
one
table
served
the
little
family
and
thus
considerable
expense
was
saved
as
well
as
much
social
comfort
gained
and
when
the
lads
grew
too
old
to
sleep
with
their
mothers
one
bed
held
the
two
boys
and
the
other
accommodated
the
two
women
and
despite
toil
want
care
the
sorrow
for
the
dead
and
the
neglect
of
the
living
this
was
a
loving
contented
and
cheerful
little
household
how
much
of
their
private
history
these
women
might
have
confided
to
each
other
was
not
known
but
it
was
certain
that
they
continued
fast
friends
up
to
the
time
of
the
death
of
mrs
greyson
after
which
the
widow
rocke
assumed
a
double
burden
and
became
a
second
mother
to
the
orphan
boy
until
herbert
himself
ashamed
of
taxing
her
small
means
ran
away
as
he
had
said
and
went
to
sea
every
year
had
herbert
written
to
his
kind
foster
mother
and
his
dear
brother
as
he
called
traverse
and
at
the
end
of
every
prosperous
voyage
when
he
had
a
little
money
he
had
sent
them
funds
but
not
always
did
these
letters
or
remittances
reach
the
widow
s
cottage
and
long
seasons
of
intense
anxiety
would
be
suffered
by
her
for
the
fate
of
her
sailor
boy
as
she
always
called
herbert
only
three
times
in
all
these
years
had
herbert
found
time
and
means
to
come
down
and
see
them
and
that
was
long
ago
it
was
many
months
over
two
years
since
they
had
even
received
a
letter
from
him
and
now
the
poor
widow
and
her
son
were
almost
tempted
to
think
that
their
sailor
boy
had
quite
forsaken
them
it
is
near
the
close
of
a
late
autumnal
evening
that
i
shall
introduce
you
reader
into
the
interior
of
the
widow
s
cottage
you
enter
by
the
little
wooden
gate
pass
up
the
moldering
paved
walk
between
the
old
leafless
lilac
bushes
and
pass
through
the
front
door
right
into
a
large
clean
but
poor
looking
sitting
room
and
kitchen
everything
was
old
though
neatly
and
comfortably
arranged
about
this
room
a
faded
home
made
carpet
covered
the
floor
a
threadbare
crimson
curtain
hung
before
the
window
a
rickety
walnut
table
dark
with
age
sat
under
the
window
against
the
wall
old
walnut
chairs
were
placed
each
side
of
it
old
plated
candlesticks
with
the
silver
all
worn
off
graced
the
mantelpiece
a
good
fire
a
cheap
comfort
in
that
well
wooded
country
blazed
upon
the
hearth
on
the
right
side
of
the
fireplace
a
few
shelves
contained
some
well
worn
books
a
flute
a
few
minerals
and
other
little
treasures
belonging
to
traverse
on
the
left
hand
there
was
a
dresser
containing
the
little
delfware
tea
service
and
plates
and
dishes
of
the
small
family
before
the
fire
with
her
knitting
in
her
hand
sat
marah
rocke
watching
the
kettle
as
it
hung
singing
over
the
blaze
and
the
oven
of
biscuits
that
sat
baking
upon
the
hearth
marah
rocke
was
at
this
time
about
thirty
five
years
of
age
and
of
a
singularly
refined
and
delicate
aspect
for
one
of
her
supposed
rank
her
little
form
slight
and
flexible
as
that
of
a
young
girl
was
clothed
in
a
poor
but
neat
black
dress
relieved
by
a
pure
white
collar
around
her
throat
her
jet
black
hair
was
parted
plainly
over
her
low
sweet
brow
brought
down
each
side
her
thin
cheeks
and
gathered
into
a
bunch
at
the
back
of
her
shapely
little
head
her
face
was
oval
with
regular
features
and
pale
olive
complexion
serious
lips
closed
in
pensive
thought
and
soft
dark
brown
eyes
full
of
tender
affection
and
sorrowful
memories
and
too
often
cast
down
in
meditation
beneath
the
heavy
shadows
of
their
long
thick
eyelashes
completed
the
melancholy
beauty
of
a
countenance
not
often
seen
among
the
hard
working
children
of
toil
marah
rocke
was
a
very
hard
working
woman
sewing
all
day
long
and
knitting
through
the
twilight
and
then
again
resuming
her
needle
by
candle
light
and
sewing
until
midnight
and
yet
marah
rocke
made
but
a
poor
and
precarious
living
for
herself
and
son
needlework
so
ill
paid
in
large
cities
is
even
worse
paid
in
the
country
towns
and
though
the
cottage
hearth
was
never
cold
the
widow
s
meals
were
often
scant
lately
her
son
traverse
who
occasionally
earned
a
trifle
of
money
by
doing
with
all
his
might
whatever
his
hand
could
find
to
do
had
been
engaged
by
a
grocer
in
the
town
to
deliver
his
goods
to
his
customers
during
the
illness
of
the
regular
porter
for
which
as
he
was
only
a
substitute
he
received
the
very
moderate
sum
of
twenty
five
cents
a
day
this
occupation
took
traverse
from
home
at
daybreak
in
the
morning
and
kept
him
absent
until
eight
o
was
well
for
me
he
did
not
require
me
to
talk
i
should
have
betrayed
myself
if
i
had
attempted
it
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
pair
who
stood
a
few
yards
from
us
phil
bending
down
was
whispering
in
low
tones
to
his
companion
in
the
pink
domino
there
was
something
in
her
attitude
as
she
listened
with
half
bent
head
that
i
could
not
fail
to
recognize
and
from
below
the
edge
of
her
domino
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
yellow
brocade
there
was
but
one
to
whom
phil
could
talk
in
those
earnest
tones
but
one
to
whom
he
could
tell
that
tale
josephine
i
saw
must
have
gone
upstairs
and
put
on
the
domino
over
her
first
dress
the
more
to
puzzle
some
of
her
partners
kitty
had
in
some
way
become
acquainted
with
her
intention
and
seized
upon
it
to
further
the
deception
that
she
saw
prevailed
in
regard
to
me
there
was
very
little
that
escaped
that
clever
jade
i
wished
with
a
sigh
that
she
were
less
unscrupulous
in
a
few
moments
the
cousins
passed
where
we
sat
nearly
concealed
from
them
walking
slowly
and
talking
earnestly
you
cannot
ask
me
to
endure
it
longer
this
suspense
is
misery
he
said
with
a
quiver
in
his
manly
voice
dear
phil
murmured
the
clear
low
tones
of
his
companion
you
must
know
my
feelings
toward
you
i
have
never
tried
to
hide
them
but
you
know
how
it
is
you
know
it
would
be
madness
for
either
of
us
to
think
of
each
other
why
would
it
be
madness
he
urged
oh
josephine
why
cannot
you
give
up
the
ambition
that
separates
us
depend
upon
it
it
has
stood
in
the
way
of
your
happiness
all
your
life
it
had
been
impossible
to
avoid
hearing
this
conversation
my
companion
starting
up
looked
after
the
retreating
figures
amazed
and
stern
in
his
haste
he
had
pulled
down
an
american
flag
that
had
been
draped
over
the
sofa
we
occupied
i
started
up
and
involuntarily
raised
my
hand
to
replace
it
the
loose
sleeve
fell
back
from
my
arm
and
in
the
strong
light
of
the
lamp
overhead
the
scar
on
my
wrist
caught
his
eye
with
a
quick
imperious
movement
he
seized
my
hand
before
i
could
withdraw
it
and
held
it
firmly
in
one
of
his
while
with
the
other
he
raised
my
mask
you
have
deceived
me
he
said
between
his
teeth
you
have
deceived
yourself
you
are
the
victim
of
your
own
prejudices
you
cannot
say
i
did
more
than
humor
your
decision
i
returned
quickly
you
only
acted
a
womanly
and
natural
part
lied
sweetly
in
every
glance
of
your
bright
eyes
in
every
turn
of
your
graceful
figure
in
every
word
on
your
red
lips
i
do
nt
blame
you
you
are
a
woman
you
are
too
cruel
you
will
repent
this
some
day
it
will
be
the
bitterest
thing
you
have
to
remember
the
recollection
of
it
will
make
you
suffer
as
you
have
made
me
suffer
never
fear
but
i
shall
have
enough
to
suffer
if
the
present
is
any
earnest
of
the
future
for
me
your
kindest
wishes
will
be
more
than
realized
for
a
proud
man
he
said
with
a
low
bitter
laugh
flinging
from
him
the
hand
he
held
for
a
proud
man
i
have
had
some
humiliations
that
you
would
hardly
believe
if
i
told
you
you
could
hardly
understand
them
in
your
simplicity
your
soft
woman
s
heart
would
bleed
perhaps
but
it
would
heal
itself
too
soon
to
allay
in
any
great
degree
my
wretchedness
your
morning
glory
tenderness
would
droop
before
the
fierceness
of
my
pain
it
would
die
in
my
hot
grasp
i
will
not
ask
your
pity
but
spare
me
your
detestation
save
the
aversion
that
your
eyes
showed
then
for
those
who
have
deserved
it
better
at
your
hands
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
from
within
a
window
near
us
was
thrown
open
and
a
group
of
people
laughing
and
talking
stepped
out
on
the
piazza
hastily
restoring
my
mask
to
its
place
i
turned
away
and
entered
the
house
through
the
window
they
had
opened
you
may
have
deceived
one
who
is
indifferent
to
you
you
cannot
deceive
one
who
loves
you
said
a
low
voice
in
my
ear
and
the
black
figure
i
instinctively
dreaded
stood
beside
me
for
the
sake
of
heaven
come
with
me
one
moment
who
are
you
i
murmured
shrinking
back
he
bent
down
and
whispered
a
name
in
my
ear
at
which
the
color
left
my
cheek
the
light
my
eye
almost
the
life
my
pulses
will
you
come
i
bent
my
head
without
a
word
and
followed
him
out
of
the
hall
down
the
terrace
through
the
winding
paths
of
the
shrubbery
across
the
garden
hurrying
on
to
suit
his
fierce
pace
but
chilled
to
the
heart
with
a
terror
that
was
no
longer
nameless
chapter
xxxii
o
man
while
in
thy
early
years
how
prodigal
of
time
misspending
all
thy
precious
hours
thy
glorious
youthful
prime
alternate
follies
take
the
sway
licentious
passions
burn
which
tenfold
force
give
nature
s
law
that
man
was
made
to
mourn
burns
the
spot
to
which
my
companion
led
me
was
a
ruined
summerhouse
not
a
stone
s
throw
from
the
outer
garden
hedge
it
was
a
lonely
place
in
a
sort
of
hollow
a
low
dense
orchard
stretched
dark
on
one
side
while
a
little
knoll
crowned
with
copse
rose
between
it
and
all
view
of
the
house
and
grounds
on
the
other
and
a
little
stream
fell
murmuring
down
from
rock
to
rock
through
the
ravine
why
it
was
so
deserted
and
dilapidated
i
had
never
exactly
known
but
from
something
stephen
had
said
when
i
had
questioned
him
about
it
i
had
conjectured
that
it
was
associated
with
the
shame
and
fall
of
her
whose
memory
was
even
yet
so
painful
and
that
ruin
and
decay
were
welcome
lucia
it
was
all
they
said
and
wept
again
quietly
aunt
martha
was
dressed
in
sober
black
her
face
was
very
comely
for
the
hardness
that
came
with
a
morbid
and
mistaken
zeal
was
mellowed
and
the
sadness
of
experience
softened
it
i
have
lived
not
far
from
you
lucia
all
these
long
years
martha
and
you
did
not
come
to
me
i
did
not
dare
listen
lucia
if
a
woman
who
had
always
gratified
her
love
of
admiration
and
gloried
in
the
power
of
gratifying
it
who
conquered
men
and
loved
to
conquer
them
who
was
a
woman
of
ungoverned
will
and
indomitable
pride
should
encounter
as
how
often
they
do
a
man
who
utterly
conquered
her
and
betrayed
her
through
the
very
weakness
that
springs
from
pride
do
you
not
see
that
such
a
woman
would
go
near
to
insanity
as
i
have
been
believing
that
i
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
and
that
no
punishment
could
be
painful
enough
mrs
bennet
looked
alarmed
no
no
there
is
no
reason
said
her
sister
observing
it
the
man
came
i
could
not
resist
him
there
was
a
form
of
marriage
i
believed
that
it
was
i
who
had
conquered
he
left
me
my
child
was
born
i
appealed
to
lawrence
newt
our
old
friend
and
playmate
he
promised
me
faithful
secrecy
and
through
him
the
child
was
sent
where
gabriel
was
at
school
then
i
withdrew
from
both
i
thought
it
was
the
will
of
god
i
felt
myself
commanded
to
a
living
death
dead
to
every
friend
and
kinsman
dead
to
every
thing
but
my
degradation
and
its
punishment
and
yet
consciously
close
to
you
near
to
all
old
haunts
and
familiar
faces
lost
to
them
all
lost
to
my
child
her
voice
faltered
and
the
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
but
i
persevered
the
old
passionate
pride
was
changed
to
a
kind
of
religious
frenzy
lawrence
newt
went
and
came
to
and
from
india
i
was
utterly
lost
to
the
world
i
knew
that
my
child
would
never
know
me
for
lawrence
had
promised
that
he
would
not
betray
me
and
when
i
disappeared
from
his
view
lawrence
gradually
came
to
consider
me
dead
then
amy
discovered
me
among
the
poor
souls
she
visited
and
through
amy
lawrence
newt
and
by
them
i
have
been
led
out
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
see
the
blessed
light
of
love
once
more
she
bowed
her
head
in
uncontrollable
emotion
and
your
son
said
her
sister
half
smiling
through
her
sympathetic
tears
will
be
yours
also
amy
tells
me
said
aunt
martha
thank
god
thank
god
martha
who
gave
him
his
name
asked
mrs
bennet
aunt
martha
paused
for
a
little
while
then
she
said
you
never
knew
who
my
my
husband
was
never
i
remember
he
never
came
to
the
house
well
i
gave
my
child
almost
his
father
s
name
i
called
him
wynne
his
father
s
name
was
wayne
mrs
bennet
clasped
her
hands
in
her
lap
how
wonderful
how
wonderful
was
all
she
said
lawrence
newt
knocked
at
the
door
and
amy
and
he
came
in
there
was
so
sweet
and
strange
a
light
upon
amy
s
face
that
mrs
bennet
looked
at
her
in
surprise
then
she
looked
at
lawrence
newt
and
he
cheerfully
returned
her
glance
with
that
smiling
musing
expression
in
his
eyes
that
was
utterly
bewildering
to
mrs
bennet
she
could
only
look
at
each
of
the
persons
before
her
and
repeat
her
last
words
how
wonderful
how
wonderful
amy
waring
who
had
not
heard
the
previous
conversation
between
her
two
aunts
blushed
as
she
heard
these
words
as
if
mrs
bennet
had
been
alluding
to
something
in
which
amy
was
particularly
interested
amy
said
mrs
bennet
amy
could
scarcely
raise
her
eyes
there
was
an
exquisite
maidenly
shyness
overspreading
her
whole
person
at
length
she
looked
the
response
she
could
not
speak
how
could
you
asked
her
aunt
poor
amy
was
utterly
unable
to
reply
coming
and
going
in
my
house
my
dearest
niece
and
yet
hugging
such
a
secret
and
holding
your
tongue
oh
amy
amy
these
were
the
words
of
reproach
but
the
tone
and
look
and
impression
were
of
entire
love
and
sympathy
lawrence
newt
looked
calmly
on
aunt
lucia
what
could
i
do
was
all
that
amy
could
say
well
well
i
do
not
reproach
you
i
blame
nobody
i
am
too
glad
and
happy
it
is
too
wonderful
wonderful
there
was
a
fullness
and
intensity
of
emphasis
in
what
she
said
that
apparently
made
amy
suspect
that
she
had
not
correctly
understood
her
aunt
s
intention
oh
you
mean
about
aunt
martha
said
amy
with
an
air
of
relief
and
surprise
lawrence
newt
smiled
mrs
bennet
turned
to
amy
with
a
fresh
look
of
inquiry
about
aunt
martha
of
course
about
aunt
martha
why
amy
what
on
earth
did
you
suppose
it
was
about
again
the
overwhelming
impossibility
to
reply
mrs
bennet
was
very
curious
she
looked
at
her
sister
martha
who
was
smiling
intelligently
then
at
lawrence
newt
who
did
not
cease
smiling
as
if
he
were
in
no
perplexity
whatsoever
then
at
amy
who
sat
smiling
at
her
through
the
tears
that
had
gathered
in
the
thoughtful
womanly
brown
eyes
let
me
speak
said
lawrence
newt
quietly
why
should
we
not
all
be
glad
and
happy
with
you
you
have
found
a
sister
aunt
martha
has
found
herself
and
a
son
i
have
found
a
wife
and
amy
a
husband
they
returned
to
the
room
where
they
had
left
the
guests
and
the
story
was
quietly
told
to
hope
wayne
and
the
others
hope
and
edward
looked
at
each
other
little
malacca
she
said
in
a
low
tone
putting
out
her
hand
sister
hope
said
the
young
man
blushing
and
his
large
eyes
filling
with
tenderness
and
my
sister
too
whispered

she
took

hand

mrs

mr

s
political
friends
house
for
them
giving
little
parties
and
large
ones
which
were
pleasant
to
everybody
except
cousin
charles
who
detested
company
it
made
him
lie
so
but
he
was
very
well
satisfied
that
people
should
like
to
visit
and
praise
his
house
and
its
belongings
if
alice
would
take
the
trouble
of
it
upon
herself
i
made
calls
with
her
wednesday
afternoons
and
went
to
church
with
her
sunday
mornings
at
home
i
saw
little
of
her
she
was
almost
exclusively
occupied
with
the
children
their
ailments
or
their
pleasures
and
staid
in
her
own
room
or
the
nursery
when
in
the
house
i
never
occupied
one
spot
long
but
wandered
in
the
garden
which
had
a
row
of
elms
or
haunted
the
kitchen
and
stables
to
watch
black
phoebe
the
cook
or
the
men
as
they
cleaned
the
horses
or
carriages
my
own
room
was
in
a
wing
of
the
cottage
with
a
window
overlooking
the
entrance
into
the
yard
and
the
carriage
drive
this
was
its
sole
view
except
the
wall
of
a
house
on
the
other
side
of
a
high
fence
i
heard
charles
when
he
drove
home
at
night
or
away
in
the
morning
knew
when
nell
was
in
a
bad
humor
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
which
i
heard
whether
my
window
was
open
or
shut
it
was
a
pretty
room
with
a
set
of
maple
furniture
and
amber
and
white
wallpaper
and
amber
and
white
chintz
curtains
and
coverings
it
suited
the
color
of
my
hair
alice
declared
and
was
becoming
to
my
complexion
yes
said
charles
looking
at
my
hair
with
an
expression
that
made
me
put
my
hand
up
to
my
head
as
if
to
hide
it
i
knew
it
was
carelessly
dressed
i
made
a
study
that
day
of
the
girls
heads
at
school
and
from
that
time
improved
in
my
style
of
wearing
it
and
i
brushed
it
with
zeal
every
day
afterward
alice
had
my
room
kept
so
neatly
for
me
that
it
soon
came
to
be
a
reproach
and
i
was
finally
taught
by
her
example
how
to
adjust
chairs
books
and
mats
in
straight
lines
to
fold
articles
without
making
odd
corners
and
wrinkles
at
last
i
improved
so
much
that
i
could
find
what
i
was
seeking
in
a
drawer
without
harrowing
it
with
my
fingers
and
began
to
see
beauty
in
order
alice
had
a
talent
for
housekeeping
and
her
talent
was
fostered
by
the
exacting
systematic
taste
of
her
husband
he
examined
many
matters
which
are
usually
left
to
women
and
he
applied
his
business
talent
to
the
art
of
living
succeeding
in
it
as
he
did
in
everything
else
alice
told
me
that
charles
had
been
poor
that
his
father
was
never
on
good
terms
with
him
she
fancied
they
were
too
much
alike
so
he
had
turned
him
off
to
shift
for
himself
when
quite
young
when
she
met
him
he
was
the
agent
of
a
manufacturing
company
in
the
town
where
her
parents
lived
and
even
then
in
his
style
of
living
he
surpassed
the
young
men
of
her
acquaintance
the
year
before
they
were
married
his
father
died
and
as
charles
was
his
only
child
he
left
his
farm
to
him
and
ten
thousand
dollars
all
he
had
the
executors
of
the
will
were
obliged
to
advertise
for
him
not
having
any
clue
to
his
place
of
residence
he
sold
the
farm
as
soon
as
it
was
put
in
his
hands
took
the
ten
thousand
dollars
and
came
back
to
be
married
a
year
after
he
went
to
rosville
and
built
a
cotton
factory
three
miles
from
town
and
the
cottage
and
then
brought
her
and
edward
who
was
a
few
months
old
to
live
in
it
he
had
since
enlarged
the
works
employed
more
operatives
and
was
making
a
great
deal
of
money
morgeson
s
mills
she
believed
were
known
all
over
the
country
charles
was
his
own
agent
as
well
as
sole
owner
there
were
no
mills
beside
his
in
the
neighborhood
to
that
fact
she
ascribed
the
reason
of
his
having
no
difficulties
in
rosville
and
no
enmities
for
she
knew
he
had
no
wish
to
make
friends
the
rosville
people
having
no
business
in
common
with
him
had
no
right
to
meddle
and
could
find
but
small
excuse
for
comment
they
spent
she
said
five
or
six
thousand
a
year
most
of
it
went
in
horses
she
was
convinced
and
she
believed
his
flowers
cost
him
a
great
deal
too
you
must
know
cassandra
that
his
heart
is
with
his
horses
and
his
flowers
he
is
more
interested
in
them
than
he
is
in
his
children
she
looked
vexed
when
she
said
this
but
i
took
hold
of
the
edge
of
her
finely
embroidered
cape
and
asked
her
how
much
it
cost
she
laughed
and
said
fifty
dollars
but
you
see
how
many
lapels
it
has
i
have
still
a
handsomer
one
that
was
seventy
five
are
they
a
part
of
the
six
thousand
a
year
alice
of
course
but
charles
wishes
me
to
dress
and
never
stints
me
in
money
and
after
all
i
like
for
him
to
spend
his
money
in
his
own
way
it
vexes
me
sometimes
he
buys
such
wild
brutes
and
endangers
his
life
with
them
he
rides
miles
and
miles
every
year
and
it
relieves
the
tedium
of
his
journeys
to
have
horses
he
must
watch
i
suppose
nobody
in
rosville
lived
at
so
fast
a
rate
as
the
morgesons
the
oldest
families
there
were
not
the
richest
the
ryders
in
particular
judge
ryder
had
four
unmarried
daughters
they
were
the
only
girls
in
our
set
who
never
invited
us
to
visit
them
they
could
not
help
saying
with
a
fork
of
the
neck
who
are
the
morgesons
but
all
the
others
welcomed
cousin
alice
and
were
friendly
with
me
she
was
too
pretty
and
kind
hearted
not
to
be
liked
if
she
was
rich
and
cousin
charles
was
respected
was
hurriedly
summoned
to
his
aid
was
summoned
quite
as
much
in
the
capacity
of
friend
as
in
that
of
medical
attendant
the
story
of
life
or
death
was
soon
told
the
merchant
had
believed
from
the
moment
of
attack
that
his
day
of
probation
was
over
and
apart
from
his
natural
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
his
only
child
there
was
little
tie
to
bind
the
sufferer
to
earth
his
wife
his
wife
that
day
as
much
as
she
had
been
at
any
period
of
their
wedded
life
had
long
been
awaiting
him
as
he
believed
in
a
better
world
and
there
is
something
in
the
facility
with
which
those
quiet
good
people
who
seem
never
to
have
enjoyed
existence
with
the
fiery
zest
which
tingles
in
finger
and
lip
of
the
sons
of
pleasure
and
sorrow
give
up
their
hold
upon
being
and
pass
away
into
the
infinite
unknown
which
lies
beyond
the
dark
valley
something
that
may
well
make
it
a
matter
of
question
whether
theirs
is
not
after
all
the
golden
secret
of
human
happiness
for
which
all
ages
have
been
studying
and
delving
the
doctor
came
with
that
rapidity
which
was
usual
with
him
and
with
every
mark
of
intense
interest
on
his
face
and
in
his
general
demeanor
he
found
the
invalid
sinking
rapidly
and
his
attendants
the
weeping
eleanor
then
a
handsome
promising
but
defectively
educated
girl
of
near
eighteen
and
two
or
three
of
the
ladies
of
the
near
neighborhood
who
had
gathered
in
to
tender
their
services
when
it
was
known
that
the
merchant
had
been
brought
home
in
a
dying
condition
a
few
words
from
the
sufferer
uttered
in
a
low
tone
almost
in
the
ear
of
the
stooping
physician
and
then
all
the
others
were
sent
out
of
the
room
except
his
daughter
whose
pleading
gesture
asking
to
be
allowed
to
remain
within
the
room
was
not
disregarded
but
who
was
motioned
by
the
doctor
to
take
her
place
at
the
window
beyond
supposed
hearing
of
the
words
that
were
to
pass
between
the
two
friends
tell
me
the
exact
truth
said
the
low
voice
of
nicholas
hill
when
these
dispositions
had
been
made
i
am
prepared
to
hear
any
judgment
which
your
lips
may
speak
there
is
no
hope
for
me
i
am
dying
either
the
doctor
could
not
speak
or
he
would
not
he
merely
bowed
his
head
in
a
manner
that
the
questioner
well
understood
so
i
thought
from
the
first
said
the
dying
man
the
life
blood
does
not
flow
away
in
that
manner
for
nothing
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
regret
the
end
for
i
have
lived
almost
as
long
as
i
could
make
myself
useful
and
i
think
i
am
as
nearly
prepared
to
die
as
poor
fallen
humanity
can
hope
to
be
i
hope
and
believe
that
you
are
indeed
prepared
to
die
my
dear
good
friend
answered
the
doctor
with
feeling
in
his
tone
and
the
feeble
hand
of
the
sufferer
meanwhile
within
his
i
cannot
hold
out
a
false
hope
to
you
you
cannot
live
how
gladly
science
and
friendship
would
both
join
hands
in
doing
something
to
keep
you
in
the
world
you
know
but
how
much
we
shall
all
miss
you
and
grieve
for
you
you
do
not
know
that
you
will
miss
me
i
hope
said
the
dying
man
but
there
is
no
occasion
whatever
to
grieve
for
me
it
is
a
peaceful
end
i
think
and
in
god
s
own
good
time
i
have
but
one
anxiety
he
paused
and
the
doctor
nodded
his
head
towards
the
side
of
the
room
where
poor
eleanor
was
sitting
trying
to
distract
her
own
thoughts
by
looking
out
of
the
window
the
father
saw
that
he
understood
him
and
pressed
the
hand
that
he
held
yes
you
have
guessed
rightly
he
said
my
only
anxiety
is
for
the
fate
of
my
child
eleanor
is
a
good
girl
but
she
is
yet
very
young
and
she
will
need
protection
she
shall
find
it
said
the
doctor
solemnly
the
face
of
the
dying
man
lit
up
with
an
expression
of
the
sincerest
pleasure
and
happiness
and
his
feeble
grasp
again
pressed
the
hand
of
high
health
which
lay
so
near
his
own
ebbing
pulse
i
believe
you
and
i
thank
you
my
friend
as
well
as
physician
he
replied
i
have
not
been
afraid
to
think
of
this
day
as
they
tell
me
that
so
many
are
and
my
affairs
are
in
some
degree
prepared
for
it
i
have
a
handsome
property
though
not
a
large
one
and
you
will
find
a
will
lying
in
the
private
drawer
of
the
safe
at
the
store
with
the
exception
of
a
few
legacies
to
friends
a
small
one
to
yourself
included
it
all
goes
to
eleanor
and
you
will
find
yourself
named
my
executor
a
confidence
which
flatters
me
and
which
i
hope
i
shall
deserve
said
the
doctor
as
the
enfeebled
man
again
paused
for
a
moment
i
know
that
you
will
the
sufferer
resumed
thanks
to
my
property
eleanor
will
not
be
a
burthen
to
you
except
in
the
demand
of
care
her
few
relatives
as
you
know
are
distant
ones
and
none
of
them
reside
nearer
than
california
there
will
be
none
to
interfere
with
you
in
guiding
her
aright
keeping
her
pure
in
her
remaining
years
of
girlhood
and
watching
over
her
until
she
becomes
the
wife
of
some
honorable
man
or
in
some
other
way
ceases
to
need
your
protection
i
accept
the
charge
as
freely
as
it
is
given
and
i
will
perform
it
as
i
would
for
one
of
my
own
blood
was
the
solemn
answer
of
the
medical
man
i
knew
that
before
i
asked
or
i
should
never
have
asked
at
all
said
the
dying
man
eleanor
my
daughter
come
here
the
young
girl
obeyed
and
knelt
beside
the
bed
striving
to
restrain
her
sobs
and
tears
the
father
laid
his
hand
hans
and
gretel
on
a
bright
december
morning
long
ago
two
thinly
clad
children
were
kneeling
upon
the
bank
of
a
frozen
canal
in
holland
the
sun
had
not
yet
appeared
but
the
gray
sky
was
parted
near
the
horizon
and
its
edges
shone
crimson
with
the
coming
day
most
of
the
good
hollanders
were
enjoying
a
placid
morning
nap
even
mynheer
von
stoppelnoze
that
worthy
old
dutchman
was
still
slumbering
in
beautiful
repose
now
and
then
some
peasant
woman
poising
a
well
filled
basket
upon
her
head
came
skimming
over
the
glassy
surface
of
the
canal
or
a
lusty
boy
skating
to
his
day
s
work
in
the
town
cast
a
good
natured
grimace
toward
the
shivering
pair
as
he
flew
along
meanwhile
with
many
a
vigorous
puff
and
pull
the
brother
and
sister
for
such
they
were
seemed
to
be
fastening
something
to
their
feet
not
skates
certainly
but
clumsy
pieces
of
wood
narrowed
and
smoothed
at
their
lower
edge
and
pierced
with
holes
through
which
were
threaded
strings
of
rawhide
these
queer
looking
affairs
had
been
made
by
the
boy
hans
his
mother
was
a
poor
peasant
woman
too
poor
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
buying
skates
for
her
little
ones
rough
as
these
were
they
had
afforded
the
children
many
a
happy
hour
upon
the
ice
and
now
as
with
cold
red
fingers
our
young
hollanders
tugged
at
the
strings
their
solemn
faces
bending
closely
over
their
knees
no
vision
of
impossible
iron
runners
came
to
dull
the
satisfaction
glowing
within
in
a
moment
the
boy
arose
and
with
a
pompous
swing
of
the
arms
and
a
careless
come
on
gretel
glided
easily
across
the
canal
ah
hans
called
his
sister
plaintively
this
foot
is
not
well
yet
the
strings
hurt
me
on
last
market
day
and
now
i
cannot
bear
them
tied
in
the
same
place
tie
them
higher
up
then
answered
hans
as
without
looking
at
her
he
performed
a
wonderful
cat
s
cradle
step
on
the
ice
how
can
i
the
string
is
too
short
giving
vent
to
a
good
natured
dutch
whistle
the
english
of
which
was
that
girls
were
troublesome
creatures
he
steered
toward
her
you
are
foolish
to
wear
such
shoes
gretel
when
you
have
a
stout
leather
pair
your
klompen
wooden
shoes
would
be
better
than
these
why
hans
do
you
forget
the
father
threw
my
beautiful
new
shoes
in
the
fire
before
i
knew
what
he
had
done
they
were
all
curled
up
in
the
midst
o
the
burning
peat
i
can
skate
with
these
but
not
with
my
wooden
ones
be
careful
now
hans
had
taken
a
string
from
his
pocket
humming
a
tune
as
he
knelt
beside
her
he
proceeded
to
fasten
gretel
s
skate
with
all
the
force
of
his
strong
young
arm
oh
oh
she
cried
in
real
pain
with
an
impatient
jerk
hans
unwound
the
string
he
would
have
cast
it
on
the
ground
in
true
big
brother
style
had
he
not
just
then
spied
a
tear
trickling
down
his
sister
s
cheek
i
ll
fix
it
never
fear
he
said
with
sudden
tenderness
but
we
must
be
quick
the
mother
will
need
us
soon
then
he
glanced
inquiringly
about
him
first
at
the
ground
next
at
some
bare
willow
branches
above
his
head
and
finally
at
the
sky
now
gorgeous
with
streaks
of
blue
crimson
and
gold
finding
nothing
in
any
of
these
localities
to
meet
his
need
his
eye
suddenly
brightened
as
with
the
air
of
a
fellow
who
knew
what
he
was
about
he
took
off
his
cap
and
removing
the
tattered
lining
adjusted
it
in
a
smooth
pad
over
the
top
of
gretel
s
worn
out
shoe
now
he
cried
triumphantly
at
the
same
time
arranging
the
strings
as
briskly
as
his
benumbed
fingers
would
allow
can
you
bear
some
pulling
gretel
drew
up
her
lips
as
if
to
say
hurt
away
but
made
no
further
response
in
another
moment
they
were
all
laughing
together
as
hand
in
hand
they
flew
along
the
canal
never
thinking
whether
the
ice
would
bear
them
or
not
for
in
holland
ice
is
generally
an
all
winter
affair
it
settles
itself
upon
the
water
in
a
determined
kind
of
way
and
so
far
from
growing
thin
and
uncertain
every
time
the
sun
is
a
little
severe
upon
it
it
gathers
its
forces
day
by
day
and
flashes
defiance
to
every
beam
presently
squeak
squeak
sounded
something
beneath
hans
feet
next
his
strokes
grew
shorter
ending
oftimes
with
a
jerk
and
finally
he
lay
sprawling
upon
the
ice
kicking
against
the
air
with
many
a
fantastic
flourish
ha
ha
laughed
gretel
that
was
a
fine
tumble
but
a
tender
heart
was
beating
under
her
coarse
blue
jacket
and
even
as
she
laughed
she
came
with
a
graceful
sweep
close
to
her
prostrate
brother
are
you
hurt
hans
oh
you
are
laughing
catch
me
now
and
she
darted
away
shivering
no
longer
but
with
cheeks
all
aglow
and
eyes
sparkling
with
fun
hans
sprang
to
his
feet
and
started
in
brisk
pursuit
but
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
catch
gretel
before
she
had
traveled
very
far
her
skates
too
began
to
squeak
believing
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
she
turned
suddenly
and
skated
into
her
pursuer
s
arms
ha
ha
i
ve
caught
you
cried
hans
ha
ha
i
caught
you
she
retorted
struggling
to
free
herself
just
then
a
clear
quick
voice
was
heard
calling
hans
gretel
it
s
the
mother
said
hans
looking
solemn
in
an
instant
by
this
time
the
canal
was
gilded
with
sunlight
the
pure
morning
air
was
very
delightful
and
skaters
were
gradually
increasing
in
numbers
it
was
hard
to
obey
the
summons
but
gretel
and
hans
were
good
children
without
a
thought
of
yielding
to
the
temptation
to
linger
they
pulled
off
their
skates
leaving
half
the
knots
still
tied
hans
with
his
great
square
shoulders
and
bushy
yellow
hair
towered
failure
and
yet
looking
at
the
subject
soberly
there
was
not
the
slightest
prospect
of
success
martha
deane
was
the
girl
in
the
old
man
s
mind
and
an
instinct
stronger
than
his
vanity
told
him
that
she
never
would
or
could
be
his
wife
but
in
spite
of
that
it
must
be
his
business
to
create
a
contrary
impression
and
keep
it
alive
as
long
as
possible
perhaps
until
until
we
all
know
what
was
in
his
mind
until
the
old
man
should
die
chapter
v

at
fairthorn
s
the
fairthorn
farm
was
immediately
north
of
kennett
square
for
the
first
mile
towards
unionville
the
rich
rolling
fields
which
any
traveller
may
see
to
this
day
on
either
side
of
the
road
belonged
to
it
the
house
stood
on
the
right
in
the
hollow
into
which
the
road
dips
on
leaving
the
village
originally
a
large
cabin
of
hewn
logs
it
now
rejoiced
in
a
stately
stone
addition
overgrown
with
ivy
up
to
the
eaves
and
a
long
porch
in
front
below
which
two
mounds
of
box
guarded
the
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
down
to
the
garden
the
hill
in
the
rear
kept
off
the
north
wind
and
this
garden
caught
the
earliest
warmth
of
spring
nowhere
else
in
the
neighborhood
did
the
crocuses
bloom
so
early
or
the
peas
so
soon
appear
above
ground
the
lack
of
order
the
air
of
old
neglect
about
the
place
in
nowise
detracted
from
its
warm
cosy
character
it
was
a
pleasant
nook
and
the
relatives
and
friends
of
the
family
whose
name
was
legion
always
liked
to
visit
there
several
days
had
elapsed
since
the
chase
and
the
eventful
evening
which
followed
it
it
was
baking
day
and
the
plump
arms
of
sally
fairthorn
were
floury
white
up
to
the
elbows
she
was
leaning
over
the
dough
trough
plunging
her
fists
furiously
into
the
spongy
mass
when
she
heard
a
step
on
the
porch
although
her
gown
was
pinned
up
leaving
half
of
her
short
striped
petticoat
visible
and
a
blue
and
white
spotted
handkerchief
concealed
her
dark
hair
sally
did
not
stop
to
think
of
that
she
rushed
into
the
front
room
just
as
a
gaunt
female
figure
passed
the
window
at
the
sight
of
which
she
clapped
her
hands
so
that
the
flour
flew
in
a
little
white
cloud
and
two
or
three
strips
of
dough
peeled
off
her
arms
and
fell
upon
the
floor
the
front
door
opened
and
our
old
friend
miss
betsy
lavender
walked
into
the
room
any
person
between
kildeer
hill
and
hockessin
who
did
not
know
miss
betsy
must
have
been
an
utter
stranger
to
the
country
or
an
idiot
she
had
a
marvellous
clairvoyant
faculty
for
the
approach
of
either
joy
or
grief
and
always
turned
up
just
at
the
moment
when
she
was
most
wanted
profession
had
she
none
neither
a
permanent
home
but
for
twenty
years
she
had
wandered
hither
and
thither
in
highly
independent
fashion
turning
her
hand
to
whatever
seemed
to
require
its
cunning
a
better
housekeeper
never
might
have
lived
if
she
could
have
stuck
to
one
spot
an
admirable
cook
nurse
seamstress
and
spinner
she
refused
alike
the
high
wages
of
wealthy
farmers
and
the
hands
of
poor
widowers
she
had
a
little
money
of
her
own
but
never
refused
payment
from
those
who
were
able
to
give
it
in
order
that
she
might
now
and
then
make
a
present
of
her
services
to
poorer
friends
her
speech
was
blunt
and
rough
her
ways
odd
and
eccentric
her
name
was
rarely
mentioned
without
a
laugh
but
those
who
laughed
at
her
esteemed
her
none
the
less
in
those
days
of
weekly
posts
and
one
newspaper
she
was
politics
art
science
and
literature
to
many
families
in
person
miss
betsy
lavender
was
peculiar
rather
than
attractive
she
was
nearly
if
not
quite
fifty
years
of
age
rather
tall
and
a
little
stoop
shouldered
her
face
at
first
sight
suggested
that
of
a
horse
with
its
long
ridged
nose
loose
lips
and
short
chin
her
eyes
were
dull
gray
set
near
together
and
much
sharper
in
their
operation
than
a
stranger
would
suppose
over
a
high
narrow
forehead
she
wore
thin
bands
of
tan
colored
hair
somewhat
grizzled
and
forming
a
coil
at
the
back
of
her
head
barely
strong
enough
to
hold
the
teeth
of
an
enormous
tortoise
shell
comb
yet
her
grotesqueness
had
nothing
repellant
it
was
a
genial
caricature
at
which
no
one
could
take
offence
the
very
person
i
wanted
to
see
cried
sally
father
and
mother

sally
knew
that
this
criticism
was
true
also
that
miss
betsy

task
was
no
sinecure
and
she
therefore
thought
it
best
to
change
the
subject
there
said
she
as
miss
betsy
gave
the
thin
rope
of
her
back
hair
a
fierce
twist
and
jammed
her
high
comb
inward
and

do
come
into
the
kitchen
and
tell

the
news
while
i
set
my
loaves
to
rise
loaves
to
rise
echoed
miss
betsy
seating
herself
on
a
tall
rush
bottomed
chair
near
the
window
she
had
an
incorrigible
habit
of
repeating
the
last
three
words
of
the
person
with
whom
she
spoke
a
habit
which
was
sometimes
mimicked
good
humoredly
bank
books
were
kept
and
opening
it
brought
them
out
for
inspection
it
was
found
that
dick
had
the
sum
of
eighteen
dollars
and
ninety
cents
placed
to
his
credit
while
fosdick
had
six
dollars
and
forty
five
cents
to
explain
the
large
difference
it
must
be
remembered
that
dick
had
deposited
five
dollars
before
henry
deposited
anything
being
the
amount
he
had
received
as
a
gift
from
mr
whitney
how
much
does
that
make
the
lot
of
it
asked
dick
i
aint
much
on
figgers
yet
you
know
it
makes
twenty
five
dollars
and
thirty
five
cents
dick
said
his
companion
who
did
not
understand
the
thought
which
suggested
the
question
take
it
and
buy
some
clothes
henry
said
dick
shortly
what
your
money
too
in
course
no
dick
you
are
too
generous
i
could
nt
think
of
it
almost
three
quarters
of
the
money
is
yours
you
must
spend
it
on
yourself
i
do
nt
need
it
said
dick
you
may
not
need
it
now
but
you
will
some
time
i
shall
have
some
more
then
that
may
be
but
it
would
nt
be
fair
for
me
to
use
your
money
dick
i
thank
you
all
the
same
for
your
kindness
well
i
ll
lend
it
to
you
then
persisted
dick
and
you
can
pay
me
when
you
get
to
be
a
rich
merchant
but
it
is
nt
likely
i
ever
shall
be
one
how
d
you
know
i
went
to
a
fortun
teller
once
and
she
told
me
i
was
born
under
a
lucky
star
with
a
hard
name
and
i
should
have
a
rich
man
for
my
particular
friend
who
would
make
my
fortun
i
guess
you
are
going
to
be
the
rich
man
fosdick
laughed
and
steadily
refused
for
some
time
to
avail
himself
of
dick
s
generous
proposal
but
at
length
perceiving
that
our
hero
seemed
much
disappointed
and
would
be
really
glad
if
his
offer
were
accepted
he
agreed
to
use
as
much
as
might
be
needful
this
at
once
brought
back
dick
s
good
humor
and
he
entered
with
great
enthusiasm
into
his
friend
s
plans
the
next
day
they
withdrew
the
money
from
the
bank
and
when
business
got
a
little
slack
in
the
afternoon
set
out
in
search
of
a
clothing
store
dick
knew
enough
of
the
city
to
be
able
to
find
a
place
where
a
good
bargain
could
be
obtained
he
was
determined
that
fosdick
should
have
a
good
serviceable
suit
even
if
it
took
all
the
money
they
had
the
result
of
their
search
was
that
for
twenty
three
dollars
fosdick
obtained
a
very
neat
outfit
including
a
couple
of
shirts
a
hat
and
a
pair
of
shoes
besides
a
dark
mixed
suit
which
appeared
stout
and
of
good
quality
shall
i
send
the
bundle
home
asked
the
salesman
impressed
by
the
off
hand
manner
in
which
dick
drew
out
the
money
in
payment
for
the
clothes
thank
you
said
dick
you
re
very
kind
but
i
ll
take
it
home
myself
and
you
can
allow
me
something
for
my
trouble
all
right
said
the
clerk
laughing
i
ll
allow
it
on
your
next
purchase
proceeding
to
their
apartment
in
mott
street
fosdick
at
once
tried
on
his
new
suit
and
it
was
found
to
be
an
excellent
fit
dick
surveyed
his
new
friend
with
much
satisfaction
you
look
like
a
young
gentleman
of
fortun
he
said
and
do
credit
to
your
governor
i
suppose
that
means
you
dick
said
fosdick
laughing
in
course
it
does
you
should
say
of
course
said
fosdick
who
in
virtue
of
his
position
as
dick
s
tutor
ventured
to
correct
his
language
from
time
to
time
how
dare
you
correct
your
gov
nor
said
dick
with
comic
indignation
i
ll
cut
you
off
with
a
shillin
you
young
dog
as
the
markis
says
to
his
nephew
in
the
play
at
the
old
bowery
chapter
xix
fosdick
changes
his
business
fosdick
did
not
venture
to
wear
his
new
clothes
while
engaged
in
his
business
this
he
felt
would
have
been
wasteful
extravagance
about
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
business
slackened
he
went
home
and
dressing
himself
went
to
a
hotel
where
he
could
see
copies
of
the
morning
herald
and
sun
and
noting
down
the
places
where
a
boy
was
wanted
went
on
a
round
of
applications
but
he
found
it
no
easy
thing
to
obtain
a
place
swarms
of
boys
seemed
to
be
out
of
employment
and
it
was
not
unusual
to
find
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
applicants
for
a
single
place
there
was
another
difficulty
it
was
generally
desired
that
the
boy
wanted
should
reside
with
his
parents
when
fosdick
on
being
questioned
revealed
the
fact
of
his
having
no
parents
and
being
a
boy
of
the
street
this
was
generally
sufficient
of
itself
to
insure
a
refusal
merchants
were
afraid
to
trust
one
who
had
led
such
a
vagabond
life
dick
who
was
always
ready
for
an
emergency
suggested
borrowing
a
white
wig
and
passing
himself
off
for
fosdick
s
father
or
grandfather
but
henry
thought
this
might
be
rather
a
difficult
character
for
our
hero
to
sustain
after
fifty
applications
and
as
many
failures
fosdick
began
to
get
discouraged
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
out
of
his
present
business
for
which
he
felt
unfitted
i
do
nt
know
but
i
shall
have
to
black
boots
all
my
life
he
said
one
day
despondently
to
dick
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
said
dick
by
the
time
you
get
to
be
a
gray
headed
veteran
you
may
get
a
chance
to
run
errands
for
some
big
firm
on
the
bowery
which
is
a
very
cheerin
reflection
so
dick
by
his
drollery
and
perpetual
good
spirits
kept
up
fosdick
s
courage
as
for
me
said
dick
i
expect
by
that
time
to
lay
up
a
colossal
fortun
out
of
shines
and
live
in
princely
style
on
the
avenoo
but
one
morning
fosdick
straying
into
french
s
hotel
just
going
to
rehearse
the
dignified
exit
when
a
step
in
the
hall
made
her
fly
into
her
seat
and
begin
to
sew
as
fast
as
if
her
life
depended
on
finishing
that
particular
seam
in
a
given
time
jo
smothered
a
laugh
at
the
sudden
change
and
when
someone
gave
a
modest
tap
opened
the
door
with
a
grim
aspect
which
was
anything
but
hospitable
good
afternoon
i
came
to
get
my
umbrella
that
is
to
see
how
your
father
finds
himself
today
said
mr
brooke
getting
a
trifle
confused
as
his
eyes
went
from
one
telltale
face
to
the
other
it
s
very
well
he
s
in
the
rack
i
ll
get
him
and
tell
it
you
are
here
and
having
jumbled
her
father
and
the
umbrella
well
together
in
her
reply
jo
slipped
out
of
the
room
to
give
meg
a
chance
to
make
her
speech
and
air
her
dignity
but
the
instant
she
vanished
meg
began
to
sidle
toward
the
door
murmuring
mother
will
like
to
see
you
pray
sit
down
i
ll
call
her
do
nt
go
are
you
afraid
of
me
margaret
and
mr
brooke
looked
so
hurt
that
meg
thought
she
must
have
done
something
very
rude
she
blushed
up
to
the
little
curls
on
her
forehead
for
he
had
never
called
her
margaret
before
and
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
natural
and
sweet
it
seemed
to
hear
him
say
it
anxious
to
appear
friendly
and
at
her
ease
she
put
out
her
hand
with
a
confiding
gesture
and
said
gratefully
how
can
i
be
afraid
when
you
have
been
so
kind
to
father
i
only
wish
i
could
thank
you
for
it
shall
i
tell
you
how
asked
mr
brooke
holding
the
small
hand
fast
in
both
his
own
and
looking
down
at
meg
with
so
much
love
in
the
brown
eyes
that
her
heart
began
to
flutter
and
she
both
longed
to
run
away
and
to
stop
and
listen
oh
no
please
do
nt
i
d
rather
not
she
said
trying
to
withdraw
her
hand
and
looking
frightened
in
spite
of
her
denial
i
wo
nt
trouble
you
i
only
want
to
know
if
you
care
for
me
a
little
meg
i
love
you
so
much
dear
added
mr
brooke
tenderly
this
was
the
moment
for
the
calm
proper
speech
but
meg
did
nt
make
it
she
forgot
every
word
of
it
hung
her
head
and
answered
i
do
nt
know
so
softly
that
john
had
to
stoop
down
to
catch
the
foolish
little
reply
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
worth
the
trouble
for
he
smiled
to
himself
as
if
quite
satisfied
pressed
the
plump
hand
gratefully
and
said
in
his
most
persuasive
tone
will
you
try
and
find
out
i
want
to
know
so
much
for
i
ca
nt
go
to
work
with
any
heart
until
i
learn
whether
i
am
to
have
my
reward
in
the
end
or
not
i
m
too
young
faltered
meg
wondering
why
she
was
so
fluttered
yet
rather
enjoying
it
i
ll
wait
and
in
the
meantime
you
could
be
learning
to
like
me
would
it
be
a
very
hard
lesson
dear
not
if
i
chose
to
learn
it
but
please
choose
to
learn
meg
i
love
to
teach
and
this
is
easier
than
german
broke
in
john
getting
possession
of
the
other
hand
so
that
she
had
no
way
of
hiding
her
face
as
he
bent
to
look
into
it
his
tone
was
properly
beseeching
but
stealing
a
shy
look
at
him
meg
saw
that
his
eyes
were
merry
as
well
as
tender
and
that
he
wore
the
satisfied
smile
of
one
who
had
no
doubt
of
his
success
this
nettled
her
annie
moffat
s
foolish
lessons
in
coquetry
came
into
her
mind
and
the
love
of
power
which
sleeps
in
the
bosoms
of
the
best
of
little
women
woke
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
took
possession
of
her
she
felt
excited
and
strange
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
followed
a
capricious
impulse
and
withdrawing
her
hands
said
petulantly
i
do
nt
choose
please
go
away
and
let
me
be
poor
mr
brooke
looked
as
if
his
lovely
castle
in
the
air
was
tumbling
about
his
ears
for
he
had
never
seen
meg
in
such
a
mood
before
and
it
rather
bewildered
him
do
you
really
mean
that
he
asked
anxiously
following
her
as
she
walked
away
yes
i
do
i
do
nt
want
to
be
worried
about
such
things
father
says
i
need
nt
it
s
too
soon
and
i
d
rather
not
may
nt
i
hope
you
ll
change
your
mind
by
and
by
i
ll
wait
and
say
nothing
till
you
have
had
more
time
do
nt
play
with
me
meg
i
did
nt
think
that
of
you
do
nt
think
of
me
at
all
i
d
rather
you
would
nt
said
meg
taking
a
naughty
satisfaction
in
trying
her
lover
s
patience
and
her
own
power
he
was
grave
and
pale
now
and
looked
decidedly
more
like
the
novel
heroes
whom
she
admired
but
he
neither
slapped
his
forehead
nor
tramped
about
the
room
as
they
did
he
just
stood
looking
at
her
so
wistfully
so
tenderly
that
she
found
her
heart
relenting
in
spite
of
herself
what
would
have
happened
next
i
cannot
say
if
aunt
march
had
not
come
hobbling
in
at
this
interesting
minute
the
old
lady
could
nt
resist
her
longing
to
see
her
nephew
for
she
had
met
laurie
as
she
took
her
airing
and
hearing
of
mr
march
s
arrival
drove
straight
out
to
see
him
the
family
were
all
busy
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
and
she
had
made
her
way
quietly
in
hoping
to
surprise
them
she
did
surprise
two
of
them
so
much
that
meg
started
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
and
mr
brooke
vanished
into
the
study
bless
me
what
s
all
this
cried
the
old
lady
with
a
rap
folly
that
was
creeping
over
me
for
during
the
long
silent
ride
i
had
examined
my
conduct
from
every
stand
point
and
there
was
no
view
i
could
take
of
myself
in
which
i
did
not
look
like
a
very
foolish
person
indeed
as
we
came
within
sight
of
the
spires
of
rivermouth
i
would
nt
have
cared
if
the
up
train
which
met
us
outside
the
town
had
run
into
us
and
ended
me
contrary
to
my
expectation
and
dread
the
captain
was
not
visible
when
we
stepped
from
the
cars
sailor
ben
glanced
among
the
crowd
of
faces
apparently
looking
for
him
too
conway
was
there
he
was
always
hanging
about
the
station
and
if
he
had
intimated
in
any
way
that
he
knew
of
my
disgrace
and
enjoyed
it
i
should
have
walked
into
him
i
am
certain
but
this
defiant
feeling
entirely
deserted
me
by
the
time
we
reached
the
nutter
house
the
captain
himself
opened
the
door
come
on
board
sir
said
sailor
ben
scraping
his
left
foot
and
touching
his
hat
sea
fashion
my
grandfather
nodded
to
sailor
ben
somewhat
coldly
i
thought
and
much
to
my
astonishment
kindly
took
me
by
the
hand
i
was
unprepared
for
this
and
the
tears
which
no
amount
of
severity
would
have
wrung
from
me
welled
up
to
my
eyes
the
expression
of
my
grandfather
s
face
as
i
glanced
at
it
hastily
was
grave
and
gentle
there
was
nothing
in
it
of
anger
or
reproof
i
followed
him
into
the
sitting
room
and
obeying
a
motion
of
his
hand
seated
myself
on
the
sofa
he
remained
standing
by
the
round
table
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
then
leaned
over
and
picked
up
a
letter
it
was
a
letter
with
a
great
black
seal
chapter
twenty
one
in
which
i
leave
rivermouth
a
letter
with
a
great
black
seal
i
knew
then
what
had
happened
as
well
as
i
know
it
now
but
which
was
it
father
or
mother
i
do
not
like
to
look
back
to
the
agony
and
suspense
of
that
moment
my
father
had
died
at
new
orleans
during
one
of
his
weekly
visits
to
the
city
the
letter
bearing
these
tidings
had
reached
rivermouth
the
evening
of
my
flight
had
passed
me
on
the
road
by
the
down
train
i
must
turn
back
for
a
moment
to
that
eventful
evening
when
i
failed
to
make
my
appearance
at
supper
the
captain
began
to
suspect
that
i
had
really
started
on
my
wild
tour
southward
a
conjecture
which
sailor
ben
s
absence
helped
to
confirm
i
had
evidently
got
off
by
the
train
and
sailor
ben
had
followed
me
there
was
no
telegraphic
communication
between
boston
and
rivermouth
in
those
days
so
my
grandfather
could
do
nothing
but
await
the
result
even
if
there
had
been
another
mail
to
boston
he
could
not
have
availed
himself
of
it
not
knowing
how
to
address
a
message
to
the
fugitives
the
post
office
was
naturally
the
last
place
either
i
or
the
admiral
would
think
of
visiting
my
grandfather
however
was
too
full
of
trouble
to
allow
this
to
add
to
his
distress
he
knew
that
the
faithful
old
sailor
would
not
let
me
come
to
any
harm
and
even
if
i
had
managed
for
the
time
being
to
elude
him
was
sure
to
bring
me
back
sooner
or
later
our
return
therefore
by
the
first
train
on
the
following
day
did
not
surprise
him
i
was
greatly
puzzled
as
i
have
said
by
the
gentle
manner
of
his
reception
but
when
we
were
alone
together
in
the
sitting
room
and
he
began
slowly
to
unfold
the
letter
i
understood
it
all
i
caught
a
sight
of
my
mother
s
handwriting
in
the
superscription
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
tell
me
my
grandfather
held
the
letter
a
few
seconds
irresolutely
and
then
commenced
reading
it
aloud
but
he
could
get
no
further
than
the
date
i
ca
nt
read
it
tom
said
the
old
gentleman
breaking
down
i
thought
i
could
he
handed
it
to
me
i
took
the
letter
mechanically
and
hurried
away
with
it
to
my
little
room
where
i
had
passed
so
many
happy
hours
the
week
that
followed
the
receipt
of
this
letter
is
nearly
a
blank
in
my
memory
i
remember
that
the
days
appeared
endless
that
at
times
i
could
not
realize
the
misfortune
that
had
befallen
us
and
my
heart
upbraided
me
for
not
feeling
a
deeper
grief
that
a
full
sense
of
my
loss
would
now
and
then
sweep
over
me
like
an
inspiration
and
i
would
steal
away
to
my
chamber
or
wander
forlornly
about
the
gardens
i
remember
this
but
little
more
as
the
days
went
by
my
first
grief
subsided
and
in
its
place
grew
up
a
want
which
i
have
experienced
at
every
step
in
life
from
boyhood
to
manhood
often
even
now
after
all
these
years
when
i
see
a
lad
of
twelve
or
fourteen
walking
by
his
father
s
side
and
glancing
merrily
up
at
his
face
i
turn
and
look
after
them
and
am
conscious
that
i
have
missed
companionship
most
sweet
and
sacred
i
shall
not
dwell
on
this
portion
of
my
story
there
were
many
tranquil
pleasant
hours
in
store
for
me
at
that
period
and
i
prefer
to
turn
to
them
one
evening
the
captain
came
smiling
into
the
sitting
room
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
my
mother
had
arrived
at
new
york
and
would
be
with
us
the
next
day
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
years
it
seemed
to
me
something
of
the
old
cheerfulness
mingled
with
our
conversation
round
the
evening
lamp
i
was
to
go
to
boston
with
the
captain
to
meet
her
and
bring
her
home
i
need
not
describe
that
meeting
with
my
mother
s
hand
in
mine
once
more
all
the
long
years
we
had
been
parted
appeared
like
a
dream
very
dear
to
me
was
the
might
do
with
a
sheriff
was
a
question
i
must
not
detain
the
reader
to
tell
how
the
mob
rose
nobody
knows
how
such
things
come
about
their
origin
is
as
inexplicable
as
that
of
an
earthquake
but
at
any
rate
a
rope
was
twice
put
round
small
s
neck
during
that
night
and
both
times
small
was
saved
only
by
the
nerve
and
address
of
ralph
who
had
learned
how
unjust
mob
law
may
be
as
for
small
he
neither
trembled
when
they
were
ready
to
hang
him
nor
looked
relieved
when
he
was
saved
nor
showed
the
slightest
flush
of
penitence
or
gratitude
he
bore
himself
in
a
quiet
gentlemanly
way
throughout
like
the
admirable
villain
that
he
was
he
waived
a
preliminary
examination
the
next
day
his
father
went
his
bail
and
he
forfeited
bail
and
disappeared
from
the
county
and
from
the
horizon
of
my
story
two
reports
concerning
small
have
been
in
circulation
one
that
he
was
running
a
faro
bank
in
san
francisco
the
other
that
he
was
curing
consumption
in
new
york
by
some
quack
process
if
this
latter
were
true
it
would
leave
it
an
open
question
whether
ralph
did
well
to
save
him
from
the
gallows
pete
jones
and
bill
as
usually
happens
to
the
rougher
villains
went
to
prison
and
when
their
terms
had
expired
moved
to
pike
county
missouri
but
it
is
about
hannah
that
you
wish
to
hear
and
that
i
wish
to
tell
she
went
straight
from
the
court
room
to
flat
creek
climbed
to
her
chamber
packed
in
a
handkerchief
all
her
earthly
goods
consisting
chiefly
of
a
few
family
relics
and
turned
her
back
on
the
house
of
means
forever
at
the
gate
she
met
the
old
woman
who
shook
her
fist
in
the
girl
s
face
and
gave
her
a
parting
benediction
in
the
words
you
mis
able
ongrateful
critter
you
go
long
i
m
glad
to
be
shed
of
you
at
the
barn
she
met
bud
and
he
told
her
good
by
with
a
little
huskiness
in
his
voice
while
a
tear
glistened
in
her
eyes
bud
had
been
a
friend
in
need
and
such
a
friend
one
does
not
leave
without
a
pang
where
are
you
going
can
i
no
no
and
with
that
she
hastened
on
afraid
that
bud
would
offer
to
hitch
up
the
roan
colt
and
she
did
not
want
to
add
to
his
domestic
unhappiness
by
compromising
him
in
that
way
it
was
dusk
and
was
raining
when
she
left
the
hours
were
long
the
road
was
lonely
and
after
the
revelations
of
that
day
it
did
not
seem
wholly
safe
but
from
the
moment
that
she
found
herself
free
her
heart
had
been
ready
to
break
with
an
impatient
homesickness
what
though
there
might
be
robbers
in
the
woods
what
though
there
were
ten
rough
miles
to
travel
what
though
the
rain
was
in
her
face
what
though
she
had
not
tasted
food
since
the
morning
of
that
exciting
day
flat
creek
and
bondage
were
behind
freedom
mother
shocky
and
home
were
before
her
and
her
feet
grew
lighter
with
the
thought
and
if
she
needed
any
other
joy
it
was
to
know
that
the
master
was
clear
and
he
would
come
and
so
she
traversed
the
weary
distance
and
so
she
inquired
and
found
the
house
the
beautiful
homely
old
house
of
beautiful
homely
old
nancy
sawyer
and
knocked
and
was
admitted
and
fell
down
faint
and
weary
at
her
blind
mother
s
feet
and
laid
her
tired
head
in
her
mother
s
lap
and
wept
and
wept
like
a
child
and
said
o
mother
i
m
free
i
m
free
while
the
mother
s
tears
baptized
her
face
and
the
mother
s
trembling
fingers
combed
out
her
tresses
and
shocky
stood
by
her
and
cried
i
knowed
god
would
nt
forget
you
hanner
hannah
was
ready
now
to
do
anything
by
which
she
could
support
her
mother
and
shocky
she
was
strong
and
inured
to
toil
she
was
willing
and
cheerful
and
she
would
gladly
have
gone
to
service
if
by
that
means
she
could
have
supported
the
family
and
for
that
matter
her
mother
was
already
able
nearly
to
support
herself
by
her
knitting
but
hannah
had
been
carefully
educated
when
young
and
at
that
moment
the
old
public
schools
were
being
organized
into
a
graded
school
and
the
good
minister
who
shall
be
nameless
because
he
is
perhaps
still
living
in
indiana
and
who
in
methodist
parlance
was
called
the
preacher
in
charge
of
lewisburg
station
this
good
minister
and
miss
nancy
sawyer
got
hannah
a
place
as
teacher
in
the
primary
department
and
then
a
little
house
with
four
rooms
was
rented
and
a
little
a
very
little
furniture
was
put
into
it
and
the
old
sweet
home
was
established
again
the
father
was
gone
never
to
come
back
again
but
the
rest
were
here
and
somehow
hannah
kept
waiting
for
somebody
else
to
come
chapter
xxxiii
into
the
light
for
two
weeks
longer
ralph
taught
at
the
flat
creek
school
house
he
was
everybody
s
hero
and
he
was
bud
s
idol
he
did
what
he
could
to
get
bud
and
martha
together
and
though
bud
always
saw
her
safe
home
after
this
and
called
on
her
every
sunday
evening
yet
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
forget
his
big
fists
and
his
big
feet
long
enough
to
say
what
he
most
wanted
to
say
and
what
martha
most
wanted
him
to
say
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
ralph
found
himself
exceedingly
weary
of
flat
creek
and
exceedingly
glad
to
hear
from
mr
means
that
the
school
money
had
gin
out
it
gave
him
a
good
excuse
to
return
to
lewisburg
where
his
heart
and
his
treasure
were
a
certain
sense
of
delicacy
had
kept
him
from
writing
to
hannah
just
yet
when
he
got
to
lewisburg
he
had
good
news
his
uncle
ashamed
of
his
previous
neglect
and
cecy
was
pleased
and
dorry
and
john
kicked
their
heels
on
the
ground
in
a
tumult
of
joy
seven
pairs
of
hands
were
held
out
at
once
toward
the
basket
seven
sets
of
teeth
went
to
work
without
a
moment
s
delay
in
an
incredibly
short
time
every
vestige
of
pie
had
disappeared
and
a
blissful
stickiness
pervaded
the
party
what
shall
we
do
now
asked
clover
while
little
phil
tipped
the
baskets
upside
down
as
if
to
make
sure
there
was
nothing
left
that
could
possibly
be
eaten
i
do
nt
know
replied
katy
dreamily
she
had
left
her
seat
and
was
half
sitting
half
lying
on
the
low
crooked
bough
of
a
butternut
tree
which
hung
almost
over
the
children
s
heads

up

cecy
and

johnnie
asked
clover
anxious
to
change
the
subject
for
elsie
s
voice
was
growing
plaintive
but
johnnie
had
no
clear
ideas
as
to
her
future
she
laughed
a
great
deal
and
squeezed
dorry
s
arm
very
tight
but
that
was
all
dorry
was
more
explicit
i
mean
to
have
turkey
every
day
he
declared
and
batter
puddings
not
boiled
ones
you
know
but
little
baked
ones
with
brown
shiny
tops
and
a
great
deal
of
pudding
sauce
to
eat
on
them
and
i
shall
be
so
big
then
that
nobody
will
say
three
helps
is
quite
enough
for
a
little
boy
oh
dorry
you
pig
cried
katy
while
the
others
screamed
with
laughter
dorry
was
much
affronted
i
shall
just
go
and
tell
aunt
izzie
what
you
called
me
he
said
getting
up
in
a
great
pet
but
clover
who
was
a
born
peacemaker
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
her
coaxing
and
entreaties
consoled
him
so
much
that
he
finally
said
he
would
stay
especially
as
the
others
were
quite
grave
now
and
promised
that
they
would
nt
laugh
any
more
and
now
katy
it
s
your
turn
said
cecy
tell
us
what
you
re
going
to
be
when
you
grow
up
i
m
not
sure
about
what
i
ll
be
replied
katy
from
overhead
beautiful
of
course
and
good
if
i
can
only
not
so
good
as
you
cecy
because
it
would
be
nice
to

and
ride
with
the
young
gentlemen
sometimes
and
i
d
like
to
have
a
large
house
and
a
splendiferous
garden
and
then
you
could
all
come
and
live
with
me
and
we
would
play
in
the
garden
and
dorry
should
have
turkey
five
times
a
day
if
he
liked
and
we
d
have
a
machine
to
darn
the
stockings
and
another
machine
to
put
the
bureau
drawers
in
order
and
we
d
never
sew
or
knit
garters
or
do
anything
we
did
nt
want
to
that
s
what
i
d
like
to
be
but
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
mean
to
do
is
nt
it
the
same
thing
asked
cecy
oh
no
replied
katy
quite
different
for
you
see
i
mean
to
do
something
grand
i
do
nt
know
what
yet
but
when
i
m
grown
up
i
shall
find
out
poor
katy
always
said
when
i
m
grown
up
forgetting
how
very
much
she
had
grown
already
perhaps
she
went
on
it
will
be
rowing
out
in
boats
and
saving
peoples
lives
like
that
girl
in
the
book
or
perhaps
i
shall
go
and
nurse
in
the
hospital
like
miss
nightingale
or
else
i
ll
head
still
spat
a
mosquito
which
after
considerable
reconnoitring
had
settled
upon
bressant
s
broad
hand
had
sacrificed
its
life
to
rescue
cornelia
from
her
dilemma
bressant
felt
the
soft
warm
fingers
strike
smartly
and
then
begin
to
remove
cautiously
and
slowly
because
the
mosquito
was
possibly
not
dead
after
all
what
was
the
matter
with
the
young
man
his
blood
and
senses
seemed
to
quiver
and
tingle
with
a
sensation
at
once
delicious
and
confusing
in
the
same
instant
he
had
seized
the
soft
warm
fingers
in
both
his
hands
and
pressed
them
convulsively
and
almost
fiercely
cornelia
very
naturally
cried
out
and
sprang
to
her
feet
bressant
it
would
seem
not
so
naturally
did
the
same
thing
and
with
the
air
of
being
to
the
full
as
much
astonished
and
startled
as
she
what
do
you
mean
sir
how
dare
you
she
said
paling
after
her
first
deep
flush
he
looked
at
her
and
then
at
his
own
hand
on
which
the
accommodating
mosquito
was
artistically
flattened
and
then
at
her
again
with
a
slight
interrogative
frown
how
did
it
happen
what
was
it
i
did
nt
mean
it
cornelia
was
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
do
or
say
under
such
extraordinary
circumstances
she
felt
short
of
breath
and
indignant
but
she
had
never
heard
of
a
young
man
s
questioning
a
lady
as
to
how
he
had
come
to
take
a
liberty
with
her
as
she
stood
thus
confounded
her
unfortunate
perception
of
the
ludicrous
betrayed
her
once
more
but
this
time
her
recent
shock
played
a
part
in
it
and
came
very
near
producing
a
bad
fit
of
hysterics
bressant
looked
on
without
a
word
or
a
motion
in
less
than
a
minute
for
cornelia
s
nerves
were
very
strong
and
had
never
been
overtaxed
she
had
regained
command
of
herself
bressant
was
standing
between
her
and
the
house
and
she
pointed
up
the
path
please
go
home
as
quickly
as
possible
off
he
walked
with
every
symptom
of
readiness
and
relief
cornelia
followed
after
but
when
she
reached
the
house
she
found
her
papa
staring
inquiringly
out
of
his
study
door
the
uncanny
pupil
in
divinity
had
disappeared
chapter
vi
cornelia
begins
to
undo
a
knot
bressant
to
do
him
justice
for
he
was
on
the
whole
rather
apt
to
be
polite
than
otherwise
in
his
way
entirely
forgot
the
professor
s
existence
for
the
time
being
he
was
too
self
absorbed
to
think
of
other
people
he
thought
he
was
bewitched
and
felt
a
strong
and
healthy
impulse
to
throw
off
the
witchery
before
doing
any
thing
else
he
sprang
up
the
steps
across
the
balcony
traversed
the
hall
with
a
quick
tramp
that
shook
the
house
snatched
his
hat
from
the
old
hat
tree
came
down
upon
the
porch
step
which
creaked
in
a
paroxysm
of
reproach
at
his
unaccustomed
weight
and
in
another
moment
stood
outside
the
parsonage
gate
which
to
save
time
he
had
leaped
instead
of
opening
the
road
was
white
no
longer
but
brown
and
moist
the
sky
overhead
was
deep
purple
and
full
of
stars
the
air
wafted
about
hither
and
thither
in
little
cool
damp
puffs
which
were
a
luxury
to
inhale
bressant
drew
in
two
or
three
long
lungfuls
then
setting
his
round
straw
hat
more
firmly
on
his
head
he
leaned
slightly
forward
and
launched
himself
into
a
long
swinging
run
to
run
gracefully
and
well
is
a
rare
accomplishment
for
it
demands
a
particularly
well
adjusted
physical
organization
great
strength
and
a
deep
breath
reservoir
bressant
s
body
poised
itself
lightly
between
the
hips
and
swayed
slightly
but
easily
from
side
to
side
at
each
spring
the
knees
alternately
caught
the
weight
without
swerving
and
shifted
it
with
an
elastic
toss
from
one
to
the
other
the
feet
came
down
sharp
and
firm
and
springily
spurned
the
road
in
a
rapid
though
rhythmical
succession
in
a
few
moments
the
turn
around
the
spur
of
the
hill
was
reached
and
the
runner
was
well
settled
down
to
his
pace
the
stone
fences
the
occasional
apple
trees
the
bushes
and
bits
of
rock
bordering
the
road
slipped
by
half
seen
the
full
use
of
the
eyes
was
required
for
the
path
in
front
rough
as
it
was
with
loose
stones
and
seamed
with
irregular
ruts
easy
work
enough
however
as
long
as
it
remained
level
and
open
to
the
starlight
but
some
distance
beyond
there
dipped
a
pretty
abrupt
slope
and
here
was
need
for
care
and
quickness
sometimes
a
step
fell
short
or
struck
one
side
to
avoid
a
stone
or
lengthened
out
to
overpass
it
the
whole
body
was
thrown
more
back
and
the
heels
dug
solidly
into
the
earth
at
each
downward
leap
here
and
there
where
the
incline
was
steeper
four
or
five
foot
tramps
followed
rapidly
upon
each
other
and
then
gathering
himself
up
with
a
sudden
strong
clutch
as
it
were
the
young
man
continued
on
as
before
thus
the
slope
was
left
behind
and
now
began
a
low
long
stretch
lying
between
meadows
overshadowed
by
a
bordering
of
willow
trees
and
studded
with
lengths
of
surreptitious
puddles
for
the
ground
was
clayey
and
the
rain
was
unabsorbed
as
bressant
entered
upon
it
he
felt
the
cold
moisture
of
the
air
meet
his
warm
face
refreshingly
he
was
breathing
deep
and
regularly
and
now
let
himself
out
to
a
yet
swifter
pace
than
before
the
willow
trees
started
suddenly
from
the
forward
darkness
and
vanished
past
in
a
dusky
twinkling
the
road
seemed
drawn
in
swift
smooth
lines
from
beneath
his
feet
he
moving
as
in
a
mighty
treadmill
the
breeze
softly
smote
his
forehead
and
whispered
past
his
ears
now
he
rose
lightly
in
the
air
over
an
unexpected
puddle
striking
the
farther
side
with
feet
together
and
so
on
again
twice
or
thrice
his
steps
sounded
hollowly
over
a
plank
bridging
at
a
distance
steadily
approaching
appeared
the
outlet
light
against
the
dark
willow
setting
when
it
was
ve
been
a
blacksmith
in
my
day
and
lived
in
the
ashes
and
dust
yet
it
pleases
me
to
think
that
when
my
dead
bones
are
in
the
coffin
white
satin
padding
will
come
between
them
and
the
boards
very
sensible
people
do
have
such
whims
sometimes
said
clay
apologetically
wishing
to
be
civil
now
you
are
not
quite
callous
to
outside
impressions
in
an
encouraging
tone
not
quite
or
you
would
not
be
here
laird
told
me
how
you
studied
medicine
and
tried
journalism
and
finally
left
new
york
to
be
clerk
in
these
out
of
the
way
iron
works
because
here
was
your
home
the
mountains
had
their
hold
on
you
i
wanted
to
make
money
and
i
came
here
as
the
most
likely
place
to
make
it
laird
told
me
you
had
saved
some
money
and
were
anxious
to
double
it
soon
with
a
quick
side
glance
braddock
had
no
secrets
a
trifle
but
my
savings
for
three
years
about
seven
thousand
dollars
you
ought
to
have
put
it
into
laird
s
hands
it
would
have
grown
like
weeds
in
a
barn
yard
he
is
head
of
a
ring
in
new
york
and
philadelphia
it
s
omnipotent
sir
it
holds
one
city
at
least
lawmakers
and
lawgivers
so
closing
his
large
fingers
on
a
dandelion
seed
on
his
palm
yes
if
laird
was
a
friend
of
yours
your
money
would
have
yielded
a
thousand
fold
he
was
well
enough
disposed
to
me
but
i
may
have
had
a
prejudice
against
planting
my
money
in
such
dirty
ground
oh
h
with
the
same
quick
furtive
glance
well
i
have
had
just
such
a
fancy
in
my
time
porter
the
pork
dealer
in
new
haven
asked
me
once
to
go
in
with
him
a
sure
thing
it
was
but
i
declined
i
may
have
stood
over
the
forge
said
i
but
i
ca
nt
see
the
name
of
julius
ware
going
all
over
the
country
cut
into
greasy
hams
foolish
but
i
have
these
idiosyncrasies
ca
nt
cure
myself
of
them
any
more
than
of
my
cleft
chin
braddock
was
silent
they
had
run
into
another
blind
alley
of
conversation
the
only
way
out
of
which
was
that
by
which
they
had
entered
ware
that
never
wearied
subject
sat
tranquil
combing
his
magnificent
red
beard
with
his
white
fingers
and
glancing
alternately
admiringly
down
on
it
and
questioningly
over
the
rolling
hills
as
though
inquiring
whether
nature
knew
who
was
coming
oh
by
the
way
he
said
presently
this
friend
of
yours
who
was
to
have
provided
the
trout
andross
has
had
some
adventure
they
say
missing
eh
yes
too
bad
if
there
has
been
murder
or
that
sort
of
thing
but
not
likely
we
newspaper
men
know
how
such
reports
grow
he
ll
turn
up
all
right
without
the
trout
probably
more
s
the
pity
come
up
tom
said
braddock
with
a
queer
tightening
of
his
lips
tom
was
carrying
them
lightly
from
the
farm
lands
into
the
higher
levels
they
had
left
judge
maddox
far
behind
the
sun
was
bright
a
cool
damp
wind
met
them
from
the
forests
full
of
astringent
piny
smells
ware
heaved
a
sigh
of
luxury
threw
his
cap
down
at
his
feet
and
stretching
back
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
never
could
be
still
a
moment
he
had
been
the
best
smith
on
the
forge
so
far
as
thundering
blows
went
now
that
he
had
neither
hammer
nor
anvil
and
was
cased
in
by
broadcloth
clothes
and
an
education
some
restless
force
in
his
blood
worked
itself
off
in
incessant
motion
of
brain
or
body
just
now
his
brain
having
nothing
bef
ore
it
but
andross
he
employed
his
body
in
what
he
would
have
called
feeling
of
himself
the
mass
of
hair
significant
live
hair
he
knew
it
to
be
the
thick
white
prize
fighter
s
throat
the
white
stubby
fingered
hands
he
glanced
critically
and
approvingly
down
at
his
brawny
well
shaped
legs
and
then
at
braddock
s
all
of
whose
members
unfortunately
had
a
lean
and
hungry
look
but
appearing
to
remember
lazily
after
awhile
the
subject
of
conversation
do
nt
you
think
now
braddock
it
was
a
little
quixotic
in
you
to
bring
this
andross
into
the
office
with
you
to
adopt
christen
him
eh
a
middle
aged
poor
devil
with
neither
kith
nor
kin
i
hear
no
neither
kith
nor
kin
no
friends
but
yourself
and
you
pick
him
up
charcoal
burning
and
half
starved
and
get
him
work
shoulder
him
now
i
m
one
of
the
most
impulsive
of
men
but
i
never
go
into
partnership
with
incompetency
never
you
do
nt
know
andross
or
you
would
not
use
the
word
i
know
with
a
triumphant
laugh
that
he
was
a
man
of
education
burning
charcoal
at
middle
age
when
you
saddled
yourself
with
him
depend
on
it
if
a
man
reaches
thirty
five
without
making
his
mark
there
s
some
part
of
the
machine
lacking
i
wonder
what
scrape
the
fellow
has
tumbled
into
now
a
woman
eh
i
heard
a
hint
of
that
at
lock
haven
your
information
seems
to
have
been
minute
ware
oh
no
just
a
few
words
of
gossip
with
the
men
on
the
platform
while
you
swabbed
tom
s
mouth
i
do
nt
confine
myself
to
the
brahmin
caste
for
my
friends
i
find
companions
among
soldiers
priests
and
pariahs
besides
the
press
touching
himself
lightly
on
his
immaculately
glossy
white
shirt
absorbs
information
above
ground
as
the
long
armed
polypi
draw
in
their
dinners
under
water
and
it
is
about
as
hopeless
an
undertaking
to
fight
one
as
to
fight
the
other
eh
i
suppose
so
t
doctor
braddock
sat
more
stiffly
erect
while
his
com
panion
lolled
back
again
feeling
that
he
had
by
a
lucky
image
put
the
relative
position
of
press
and
public
forcibly
his
imagery
hair
beard
legs
here
was
unfailing
matter
for
contemplation
with
which
he
never
wearied
himself
and
oddly
enough
suggest
to
the
plaintiff
s
counsel
that
the
witness
should
be
required
to
give
his
religious
views
mr
belcher
laughed
and
mr
cavendish
sniffed
his
lips
as
if
they
had
said
a
good
thing
certainly
responded
mr
balfour
what

your
religious
views

an
the
man

the
laugh

on
mr
cavendish
the
court

audience

mr
cavendish

little
ripple
of
amusement

a
benevolent
mouth

out
over

lips

an
ther
s
the
dockyment
and
jim
drew
from
his
pocket
the
instrument
with
which
the
reader
is
already
familiar
mr
balfour
had
seen
the
paper
and
told
jim
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
the
case
mr
belcher
looked
very
red
in
the
face
and
leaned
time
hunting
up
six
bits
worth
of
old
iron
to
sell
to
the
foundry
than
they
would
to
make
twice
the
money
at
regular
work
but
that
s
human
nature
hurry
along
hurry
along
the
boys
wanted
to
know
what
the
hurry
was
about
never
mind
you
ll
see
when
we
get
to
the
widow
douglas
huck
said
with
some
apprehension
for
he
was
long
used
to
being
falsely
accused
mr
jones
we
have
nt
been
doing
nothing
the
welshman
laughed
well
i
do
nt
know
huck
my
boy
i

nt
know
about
that
ai
nt
you

the
widow
good
friends

ben
good
friends
to
me
anyway
all
right
then
what
do
you
want
to
be
afraid
for
this
question
was
not
entirely
answered
in
huck
s
slow
mind
before
he
found
himself
pushed
along
with
tom
into
mrs
douglas
drawing
room
mr
jones
left
the
wagon
near
the
door
and
followed
the
place
was
grandly
lighted
and
everybody
that
was
of
any
consequence

the
village

there
the
thatchers

harpers

rogerses

and
a
great
many
more
and
all
dressed
in
their
best
the
widow
received
the
boys
as
heartily
as
any
one
could
well
receive
two
such
looking
beings
they
were
covered
with
clay
and
candle
grease
aunt
polly
blushed
crimson
with
humiliation
and
frowned
and
shook
her
head
at
tom
nobody
suffered
half
as
much
as
the
two
boys
did
however
mr
jones
said
tom
was
nt
at
home
yet
so
i
gave
him
up
but
i
stumbled
on
him
and
huck
right
at
my
door
and
so
i
just
brought
them
along
in
a
hurry
and
you
did

right
said
the
widow
come
with
me

she
took
them
to
a
bedchamber
and

huck
said
tom
we
can
slope
if
we
can
find
a
rope
the
window
ai
nt
high
from
the
ground
shucks
what
do
you
want
to
slope
for
well
i
ai
nt
used
to
that
kind
of
a
crowd
i
ca
nt
stand
it
i
ai
nt
going
down
there
tom
oh
bother
it
ai
nt
anything
i
do
nt
mind
it
a
bit
i
ll
take
care
of
you
sid
appeared
tom
said
he
auntie
has
been
waiting
for
you
all
the
afternoon
mary
got
your
sunday
clothes
ready
and
everybody
s
been
fretting
about
you
say
ai
nt
this
grease
and
clay
on
your
clothes
now
mr
siddy
you
jist
tend
to
your
own
business
what
s
all
this
blow
out
about
anyway
it
s
one
of
the
widow
s
parties
that
she
s
always
having
this
time
it
s
for
the
welshman
and
his
sons
on
account
of
that
scrape
they
helped
her
out
of
the
other
night
and
say
i
can
tell
you
something
if
you
want
to
know
well
what
why
old
mr
jones
is
going
to
try
to
spring
something
on
the
people
here
to
night
but
i
overheard
him
tell
auntie
to
day
about
it
as
a
secret
but
i
reckon
it
s
not
much
of
a
secret
now
everybody
knows
the
widow
too
for
all
she
tries
to
let
on
she
do
nt
mr
jones
was
bound
huck
should
be
here
could
nt
get
along
with
his
grand
secret
without
huck
you
know
secret
about
what
sid
about
huck
tracking
the
robbers
to
the
widow
s
i
reckon
mr
jones
was
going
to
make
a
grand
time
over
his
surprise
but
i
bet
you
it
will
drop
pretty
flat
sid
chuckled
in
a
very
contented
and
satisfied
way
sid
was
it
you
that
told
oh
never
mind
who
it
was
somebody
told
that
s
enough
sid
there
s
only
one
person
in
this
town
mean
enough
to
do
that
and
that
s
you
if
you
had
been
in
huck
s
place
you
d
a
sneaked
down
the
hill
and
never
told
anybody
on
the
robbers
you
ca
nt
do
any
but
mean
things
and
you
ca
nt
bear
to
see
anybody
praised
for
doing
good
ones
there
no
thanks
as
the
widow
says
and
tom
cuffed
sid
s
ears
and
helped
him
to
the
door
with
several
kicks
now
go
and
tell
auntie
if
you
dare
and
to
morrow
you
ll
catch
it
some
minutes
later
the
widow
s
guests
were
at
the
supper
table
and
a
dozen
children
were
propped
up
at
little
side
tables
in
the
same
room
after
the
fashion
of
that
country
and
that
day
at
the
proper
time
mr
jones
made
his
little
speech
in
which
he
thanked
the
widow
for
the
honor
she
was
doing
himself
and
his
sons
but
said
that
there
was
another
person
whose
modesty
and
so
forth
and
so
on
he
sprung
his
secret
about
huck
s
share
in
the
adventure
in
the
finest
dramatic
manner
he
was
master
of
but
the
surprise
it
occasioned
was
largely
counterfeit
and
not
as
clamorous
and
effusive
as
it
might
have
been
under
happier
circumstances
however
the
widow
made
a
pretty
fair
show
of
astonishment
and
heaped
so
many
compliments
and
so
much
gratitude
upon
huck
that
he
almost
forgot
the
nearly
intolerable
discomfort
of
his
new
clothes
in
the
entirely
intolerable
discomfort
of
being
set
up
as
a
target
for
everybody
s
gaze
and
everybody
s
laudations
the
widow
said
she
meant
to
give
huck
a
home
under
her
roof
and
have
him
educated
and
that
when
she
could
spare
the
money
she
would
start
him
in
business
in
a
modest
way
tom
s
chance
was
come
he
said
huck
do
nt
need
it
huck
s
rich
nothing
but
sinister
motive
or
unconsciously
and
in
plain
good
faith
in
good
faith
i
should
say
mr
gryce
remained
silent
for
a
moment
it
is
very
unfortunate
you
cannot
explain
yourself
a
little
more
definitely
he
said
at
last
i
am
almost
afraid
to
trust
you
to
make
investigations
as
you
call
them
on
your
own
hook
you
are
not
used
to
the
business
and
will
lose
time
to
say
nothing
of
running
upon
false
scents
and
using
up
your
strength
on
unprofitable
details
you
should
have
thought
of
that
when
you
admitted
me
into
partnership
and
you
absolutely
insist
upon
working
this
mine
alone
mr
gryce
the
matter
stands
just
here
mr
clavering
for
all
i
know
is
a
gentleman
of
untarnished
reputation
i
am
not
even
aware
for
what
purpose
you
set
me
upon
his
trail
i
only
know
that
in
thus
following
it
i
have
come
upon
certain
facts
that
seem
worthy
of
further
investigation
well
well
you
know
best
but
the
days
are
slipping
by
something
must
be
done
and
soon
the
public
are
becoming
clamorous
i
know
it
and
for
that
reason
i
have
come
to
you
for
such
assistance
as
you
can
give
me
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
you
are
in
possession
of
certain
facts
relating
to
this
man
which
it
concerns
me
to
know
or
your
conduct
in
reference
to
him
has
been
purposeless
now
frankly
will
you
make
me
master
of
those
facts
in
short
tell
me
all
you
know
of
mr
clavering
without
requiring
an
immediate
return
of
confidence
on
my
part
that
is
asking
a
great
deal
of
a
professional
detective
i
know
it
and
under
other
circumstances
i
should
hesitate
long
before
preferring
such
a
request
but
as
things
are
i
do
nt
see
how
i
am
to
proceed
in
the
matter
without
some
such
concession
on
your
part
at
all
events
wait
a
moment
is
not
mr
clavering
the
lover
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
anxious
as
i
was
to
preserve
the
secret
of
my
interest
in
that
gentleman
i
could
not
prevent
the
blush
from
rising
to
my
face
at
the
suddenness
of
this
question
i
thought
as
much
he
went
on
being
neither
a
relative
nor
acknowledged
friend
i
took
it
for
granted
he
must
occupy
some
such
position
as
that
in
the
family
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
draw
such
an
inference
said
i
anxious
to
determine
how
much
he
knew
about
him
mr
clavering
is
a
stranger
in
town
has
not
even
been
in
this
country
long
has
indeed
had
no
time
to
establish
himself
upon
any
such
footing
as
you
suggest
this
is
not
the
only
time
mr
clavering
has
been
in
new
york
he
was
here
a
year
ago
to
my
certain
knowledge
you
know
that
yes
how
much
more
do
you
know
can
it
be
possible
i
am
groping
blindly
about
for
facts
which
are
already
in
your
possession
i
pray
you
listen
to
my
entreaties
mr
gryce
and
acquaint
me
at
once
with
what
i
want
to
know
you
will
not
regret
it
i
have
no
selfish
motive
in
this
matter
if
i
succeed
the
glory
shall
be
yours
it
i
fail
the
shame
of
the
defeat
shall
be
mine
that
is
fair
he
muttered
and
how
about
the
reward
my
reward
will
be
to
free
an
innocent
woman
from
the
imputation
of
crime
which
hangs
over
her
this
assurance
seemed
to
satisfy
him
his
voice
and
appearance
changed
for
a
moment
he
looked
quite
confidential
well
well
said
he
and
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
i
should
first
like
to
know
how
your
suspicions
came
to
light
on
him
at
all
what
reason
had
you
for
thinking
a
gentleman
of
his
bearing
and
position
was
in
any
way
connected
with
this
affair
that
is
a
question
you
ought
not
to
be
obliged
to
put
he
returned
how
so
simply
because
the
opportunity
of
answering
it
was
in
your
hands
before
ever
it
came
into
mine
what
do
you
mean
do
nt
you
remember
the
letter
mailed
in
your
presence
by
miss
mary
leavenworth
during
your
drive
from
her
home
to
that
of
her
friend
in
thirty
seventh
street
on
the
afternoon
of
the
inquest
yes
certainly
but
you
never
thought
to
look
at
its
superscription
before
it
was
dropped
into
the
box
i
had
neither
opportunity
nor
right
to
do
so
was
it
not
written
in
your
presence
it
was
and
you
never
regarded
the
affair
as
worth
your
attention
however
i
may
have
regarded
it
i
did
not
see
how
i
could
prevent
miss
leavenworth
from
dropping
a
letter
into
a
box
if
she
chose
to
do
so
that
is
because
you
are
a
gentleman
well
it
has
its
disadvantages
he
muttered
broodingly
but
you
said
i
how
came
you
to
know
anything
about
this
letter
ah
i
see
remembering
that
the
carriage
in
which
we
were
riding
at
the
time
had
been
procured
for
us
by
him
the
man
on
the
box
was
in
your
pay
and
informed
as
you
call
it
mr
gryce
winked
at
his
muffled
toes
mysteriously
that
is
not
the
point
he
said
enough
that
i
heard
that
a
letter
which
might
reasonably
prove
to
be
of
some
interest
to
me
had
been
dropped
at
such
an
hour
into
the
box
on
the
corner
of
a
certain
street
that
coinciding
in
the
opinion
of
my
informant
i
telegraphed
to
the
station
connected
with
that
box
to
take
note
of
the
address
of
a
suspicious
looking
letter
about
to
pass
through
their
hands
on
the
way
to
the
general
post
office
and
following
up
the
telegram
in
person
found
that
a
curious
epistle
addressed
in
lead
pencil
and
sealed
with
a
stamp
had
just
arrived
the
address
of
which
i
was
allowed
to
see
and
which
was
henry
r
clavering
hoffman
house
new
york
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
so
that
is
how
your
attention
first
came
see
every
thing
on
this
plantation
attached
for
debt
myself
included
can
it
be
possible
yes
it
is
mortgaged
for
every
dollar
it
is
worth
oh
heavens
what
silly
creatures
women
are
to
be
duped
by
such
men
but
say
nothing
i
will
endeavor
by
stratagem
to
secure
your
freedom
do
you
believe
he
left
his
orders
in
new
york
for
furniture
to
be
shipped
rachel
shook
her
head
and
said
you
do
nt
know
the
man
i
have
made
up
my
mind
firmly
to
make
my
stay
here
but
short
has
he
anything
he
has
a
small
plantation
south
of
here
which
i
believe
is
not
mortgaged
the
overseer
claims
it
in
order
to
keep
off
his
creditors
it
is
said
to
be
worth
thirty
or
forty
thousand
dollars
if
such
is
the
fact
i
shall
try
to
revenge
myself
upon
him
when
they
returned
home
mr
zevoe
was
there
he
had
been
absent
nearly
the
entire
day
mrs
zevoe
approached
him
affectionately
and
kissed
him
he
said
dear
jane
i
could
not
live
without
your
presence
i
am
happy
to
know
that
you
love
me
and
love
me
dearly
replied
mrs
zevoe
have
you
been
taking
a
walk
i
called
to
see
your
white
slave
i
am
surprised
at
your
thinking
that
she
is
white
he
continued
the
conversation
by
asking
her
what
she
thought
of
louisa
mrs
zevoe
carelessly
remarked
i
think
she
would
make
me
a
good
waiting
maid
with
her
and
rachel
i
think
i
could
run
this
establishment
and
make
myself
contented
i
have
one
request
to
make
of
you
what
is
it
my
dear

to
make
me
out
a
bill
of
sale
in
my
own
name
for
louisa
and
rachel
making
them

own
individual
property
mr
zevoe
laughed
and
said
that
is
just
what
i
intended
doing
louisa
has
three
children
has
she
not
he
seemed
for
a
moment
silent
after
recovering
himself
he
replied
she
has
who
is
the
father
of
her
children
that
is
a
matter
i
have
not
troubled
myself
to
ascertain
we
are
glad
to
have
our
property
increase
it
pays
good
interest
on
the
money
in
vested
mrs
zevoe
smiled
and
said
you
will
not
think
i
am
at
all
inquisitive
it
is
a
matter
that
interests
me
but
little
to
morrow
i
will
get
lawyer
wilson
to
draw
up
the
papers
he
will
be
in
the
neighborhood
and
he
promised
to
make
me
a
call
before
returning
accordingly
the
lawyer
arrived
the
following
morning
mr
zevoe
was
not
in
at
the
time
the
madam
and
him
entered
into
conversation
she
informed
him
what
she
desired
him
to
do

wilson
asked
her
if
she
had
the
consent
of
her
husband
and
if
he
would
sign
the
papers
mrs
zevoe
said
he
would

a
capital

lower

hope

will
i
think
you
have
influence
enough
with
him
to
affect
it
during
the
conversation
mr
zevoe
made
his
appearance
and
expressed
himself
highly
gratified
to
see
lawyer
wilson
after
conversing
a
few
moments
he
told
the
counsellor
what
he
desired
him
to
do
in
reference
to
rachel
and
louisa
it
is
a
wise
act
upon
your
part
the
lawyer
asked
him
to
step
outside
he
wished
to
have
a
private
conversation
with
him
they
walked
out
and
had
quite
a
consultation
his
attorney
said
your
affairs
are
in
a
critical
condition

mortgage
on
your
property
will
be
due
in
a
few
days
i
am
satisfied

you
had
better
give
your
wife
a
deed
also
of

lower
plantation
you
are
aware
that
my
overseer
mr

a
deed

the
lawyer
bade
them
good
day
the
following
day
he
met
mr
lamar
in
the
streets
of
havana
and
spoke
to
him
on
the
subject
he
said
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
resign
his
claims
to
the
plantation
notwithstanding
mr
zevoe
owed
him
some
twelve
hundred
dollars
yet
he
had
confidence
that
mr
zevoe
would
pay
every
dollar
lawyer
wilson
took
him
to
the
recorder
s
office
to
cancel
his
claim
with
the
understanding
that
mr
zevoe
would
give
him
his
note
with
an
endorser
for
the
amount
the
lawyer
gave
him
his
word
that
it
would
be
done
and
made
out
the
papers
turning
the
estate
together
with
louisa
and
her
children
and
rachel
over
to
mrs
zevoe
the
second
day
following
mr
zevoe
arrived
in
the
city
the
documents
were
signed
and
recorded
mr
zevoe
told
lawyer
wilson
that
his
wife
wished
him
to
call
out
and
see
her
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
he
said
he
would
go
and
bring
the
documents
with
him
owing
to
a
pressure
of
business
he
was
detained
he
wrote
her
a
letter
congratulating
her
on
her
success
telling
her
he
would
call
and
see
her
as
soon
as
an
opportunity
would
afford
she
wrote
a
reply
asking
him
to
make
out
free
papers
for
rachel
and
louisa
and
her
children
and
to
bring
them
when
he
came
but
not
to
divulge
it
to
chapter
i
for
reasons
which
many
persons
thought
ridiculous
mrs
lightfoot
lee
decided
to
pass
the
winter
in
washington
she
was
in
excellent
health
but
she
said
that
the
climate
would
do
her
good
in
new
york
she
had
troops
of
friends
but
she
suddenly
became
eager
to
see
again
the
very
small
number
of
those
who
lived
on
the
potomac
it
was
only
to
her
closest
intimates
that
she
honestly
acknowledged
herself
to
be
tortured
by
ennui
since
her
husband
s
death
five
years
before
she
had
lost
her
taste
for
new
york
society
she
had
felt
no
interest
in
the
price
of
stocks
and
very
little
in
the
men
who
dealt
in
them
she
had
become
serious
what
was
it
all
worth
this
wilderness
of
men
and
women
as
monotonous
as
the
brown
stone
houses
they
lived
in
in
her
despair
she
had
resorted
to
desperate
measures
she
had
read
philosophy
in
the
original
german
and
the
more
she
read
the
more
she
was
disheartened
that
so
much
culture
should
lead
to
nothing
nothing
after
talking
of
herbert
spencer
for
an
entire
evening
with
a
very
literary
transcendental
commission
merchant
she
could
not
see
that
her
time
had
been
better
employed
than
when
in
former
days
she
had
passed
it
in
flirting
with
a
very
agreeable
young
stock
broker
indeed
there
was
an
evident
proof
to
the
contrary
for
the
flirtation
might
lead
to
something
had
in
fact
led
to
marriage
while
the
philosophy
could
lead
to
nothing
unless
it
were
perhaps
to
another
evening
of
the
same
kind
because
transcendental
philosophers
are
mostly
elderly
men
usually
married
and
when
engaged
in
business
somewhat
apt
to
be
sleepy
towards
evening
nevertheless
mrs
lee
did
her
best
to
turn
her
study
to
practical
use
she
plunged
into
philanthropy
visited
prisons
inspected
hospitals
read
the
literature
of
pauperism
and
crime
saturated
herself
with
the
statistics
of
vice
until
her
mind
had
nearly
lost
sight
of
virtue
at
last
it
rose
in
rebellion
against
her
and
she
came
to
the
limit
of
her
strength
this
path
too
seemed
to
lead
nowhere
she
declared
that
she
had
lost
the
sense
of
duty
and
that
so
far
as
concerned
her
all
the
paupers
and
criminals
in
new
york
might
henceforward
rise
in
their
majesty
and
manage
every
railway
on
the
continent
why
should
she
care
what
was
the
city
to
her
she
could
find
nothing
in
it
that
seemed
to
demand
salvation
what
gave
peculiar
sanctity
to
numbers
why
were
a
million
people
who
all
resembled
each
other
any
way
more
interesting
than
one
person
what
aspiration
could
she
help
to
put
into
the
mind
of
this
great
million
armed
monster
that
would
make
it
worth
her
love
or
respect
religion
a
thousand
powerful
churches
were
doing
their
best
and
she
could
see
no
chance
for
a
new
faith
of
which
she
was
to
be
the
inspired
prophet
ambition
high
popular
ideals
passion
for
whatever
is
lofty
and
pure
the
very
words
irritated
her
was
she
not
herself
devoured
by
ambition
and
was
she
not
now
eating
her
heart
out
because
she
could
find
no
one
object
worth
a
sacrifice
was
it
ambition
real
ambition
or
was
it
mere
restlessness
that
made
mrs
lightfoot
lee
so
bitter
against
new
york
and
philadelphia
baltimore
and
boston
american
life
in
general
and
all
life
in
particular
what
did
she
want
not
social
position
for
she
herself
was
an
eminently
respectable
philadelphian
by
birth
her
father
a
famous
clergyman
and
her
husband
had
been
equally
irreproachable
a
descendant
of
one
branch
of
the
virginia
lees
which
had
drifted
to
new
york
in
search
of
fortune
and
had
found
it
or
enough
of
it
to
keep
the
young
man
there
his
widow
had
her
own
place
in
society
which
no
one
disputed
though
not
brighter
than
her
neighbours
the
world
persisted
in
classing
her
among
clever
women
she
had
wealth
or
at
least
enough
of
it
to
give
her
all
that
money
can
give
by
way
of
pleasure
to
a
sensible
woman
in
an
american
city
she
had
her
house
and
her
carriage
she
dressed
well
her
table
was
good
and
her
furniture
was
never
allowed
to
fall
behind
the
latest
standard
of
decorative
art
she
had
travelled
in
europe
and
after
several
visits
covering
some
years
of
time
had
returned
home
carrying
in
one
hand
as
it
were
a
green
grey
landscape
a
remarkably
pleasing
specimen
of
corot
and
in
the
other
some
bales
of
persian
and
syrian
rugs
and
embroideries
japanese
bronzes
and
porcelain
with
this
she
declared
europe
to
be
exhausted
and
she
frankly
avowed
that
she
was
american
to
the
tips
of
her
fingers
she
neither
knew
nor
greatly
cared
whether
america
or
europe
were
best
to
live
in
she
had
no
violent
love
for
either
and
she
had
no
objection
to
abusing
both
but
she
meant
to
get
all
that
american
life
had
to
offer
good
or
bad
and
to
drink
it
down
to
the
dregs
fully
determined
that
whatever
there
was
in
it
she
would
have
and
that
whatever
could
be
made
out
of
it
she
would
manufacture
i
know
said
she
that
america
produces
petroleum
and
pigs
i
have
seen
both
on
the
steamers
and
i
am
told
it
produces
silver
and
gold
there
is
choice
enough
for
any
woman
yet
as
has
been
already
said
mrs
lee
s
first
experience
was
not
a
success
she
soon
declared
that
new
york
might
represent
the
petroleum
or
the
pigs
but
the
gold
of
life
was
not
to
be
discovered
there
by
her
eyes
not
but
that
there
was
variety
enough
a
variety
of
people
occupations
aims
and
thoughts
but
that
all
these
after
growing
to
a
certain
height
stopped
short
they
found
nothing
to
hold
them
up
she
knew
more
or
less
intimately
a
dozen
men
whose
fortunes
ranged
between
one
million
and
forty
millions
what
did
they
do
with
their
money
what
could
they
do
with
it
that
was
different
you
do
nt
know
half
how
good
a
place
guilford
is
mr
stubbs
the
monkey
chattered
away
as
if
he
were
anticipating
lots
of
fun
on
his
arrival
at
toby
s
home
and
the
boy
chattered
back
his
spirits
rising
at
every
step
which
took
him
farther
away
from
the
collection
of
tents
where
he
had
spent
so
many
wretched
hours
a
brisk
walk
of
half
an
hour
sufficed
to
take
toby
to
the
woods
and
after
some
little
search
he
found
a
thick
clump
of
bushes
in
which
he
concluded
he
could
sleep
without
the
risk
of
being
seen
by
anyone
who
might
pass
that
way
before
he
should
be
awake
in
the
morning
he
had
not
much
choice
in
the
way
of
a
bed
for
it
was
so
dark
in
the
woods
that
it
was
impossible
to
collect
moss
or
leaves
to
make
a
soft
resting
place
and
the
few
leaves
and
pine
boughs
which
he
did
gather
made
his
place
for
sleeping
but
very
little
softer
but
during
the
ten
weeks
that
toby
had
been
with
the
circus
his
bed
had
seldom
been
anything
softer
than
the
seat
of
the
wagon
and
it
troubled
him
very
little
that
he
was
to
sleep
with
nothing
but
a
few
leaves
between
himself
and
the
earth
using
the
bundle
in
which
was
his
riding
costume
for
a
pillow
and
placing
the
lunch
mrs
treat
had
given
him
near
by
where
the
monkey
could
not
get
at
it
conveniently
he
cuddled
mr
stubbs
up
to
his
bosom
and
lay
down
to
sleep
mr
lord
wo
nt
wake
us
up
in
the
mornin
an
swear
at
us
for
not
washin
the
tumblers
said
toby
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
to
the
monkey
an
we
wo
nt
have
to
go
into
the
tent
tomorrow
an
sell
sick
lemonade
an
poor
peanuts
but
and
here
his
tone
changed
to
one
of
sorrow
there
ll
be
some
there
that
ll
be
sorry
not
to
see
us
in
the
mornin
mr
stubbs
though
they
ll
be
glad
to
know
that
we
got
away
all
right
but
wo
nt
mr
lord
swear
an
wo
nt
mr
castle
crack
his
whip
when
they
come
to
look
round
for
us
in
the
mornin
an
find
that
we
hai
nt
there
the
reply
which
the
monkey
made
to
this
was
to
nestle
his
head
closer
under
toby
s
coat
and
to
show
in
the
most
decided
manner
that
he
was
ready
to
go
to
sleep
and
toby
was
quite
as
ready
to
go
to
sleep
as
he
was
he
had
worked
hard
that
day
but
the
excitement
of
escaping
had
prevented
him
from
realizing
his
fatigue
until
after
he
had
lain
down
and
almost
before
he
had
got
through
congratulating
himself
upon
the
ease
with
which
he
had
gotten
free
both
he
and
the
monkey
were
as
sound
asleep
as
if
they
had
been
tucked
up
in
the
softest
bed
that
was
ever
made
toby
s
very
weariness
was
a
friend
to
him
that
night
for
it
prevented
him
from
waking
which
if
he
had
done
so
might
have
been
unpleasant
when
he
fully
realized
that
he
was
all
alone
in
the
forest
and
the
sounds
that
are
always
heard
in
the
woods
might
have
frightened
him
just
the
least
bit
the
sun
was
shining
directly
in
his
face
when
toby
awoke
on
the
following
morning
and
the
old
monkey
was
still
snugly
nestled
under
his
coat
he
sat
up
rather
dazed
at
first
and
then
as
he
fully
realized
that
he
was
actually
free
from
all
that
had
made
his
life
such
a
sad
and
hard
one
for
so
many
weeks
he
shouted
aloud
reveling
in
his
freedom
the
monkey
awakened
by
toby
s
cries
started
from
his
sleep
in
affright
and
jumped
into
the
nearest
tree
only
to
chatter
jump
and
swing
from
the
boughs
when
he
saw
that
there
was
nothing
very
unusual
going
on
save
that
he
and
toby
were
out
in
the
woods
again
where
they
could
have
no
end
of
a
good
time
and
do
just
as
they
liked
after
a
few
moments
spent
in
a
short
jubilee
at
their
escape
toby
took
the
monkey
on
his
shoulder
and
the
bundles
under
his
arm
again
and
went
cautiously
out
to
the
edge
of
the
thicket
where
he
could
form
some
idea
as
to
whether
or
no
they
were
pursued
he
had
entered
the
woods
at
the
brow
of
a
small
hill
when
he
had
fled
so
hastily
on
the
previous
evening
and
looking
down
he
could
see
the
spot
whereon
the
tents
of
the
circus
had
been
pitched
but
not
a
sign
of
them
was
now
visible
he
could
see
a
number
of
people
walking
around
and
he
fancied
that
they
looked
up
every
now
and
then
to
where
he
stood
concealed
by
the
foliage
this
gave
him
no
little
uneasiness
for
he
feared
that
mr
lord
or
mr
castle
might
be
among
the
number
and
he
believed
that
they
would
begin
a
search
for
him
at
once
and
that
the
spot
where
their
attention
would
first
be
drawn
was
exactly
where
he
was
then
standing
this
wo
nt
do
mr
stubbs
he
said
as
he
pushed
the
monkey
higher
up
on
his
shoulder
and
started
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
woods
we
must
get
out
of
this
place
an
go
farther
down
where
we
can
hide
till
tomorrow
mornin
besides
we
must
find
some
water
where
we
can
wash
our
faces
the
old
monkey
would
hardly
have
been
troubled
if
they
had
not
got
their
faces
washed
for
the
next
month
to
come
but
he
grinned
and
talked
as
toby
trudged
along
attempting
to
catch
hold
of
the
leaves
as
they
were
passed
and
in
various
other
ways
impeding
his
master
s
progress
until
toby
was
obliged
to
give
him
a
most
severe
scolding
in
order
to
make
him
behave
himself
in
anything
like
a
decent
manner
at
last
after
fully
half
my
to
lady
theobald
he
held
her
hand
as
calmly
as
before
he
understood
a
great
deal
more
than
she
could
have
imagined
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
her
he
asked
she
laughed
again
i
am
going
to
ask
her
what
she
means
i
am
going
to
tell
her
she
has
made
a
mistake
i
am
going
to
prove
to
her
that
i
am
not
such
a
coward
after
all
i
am
going
to
tell
her
that
i
dare
disobey
her
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
her
she
concluded
decisively
he
held
her
hand
rather
closer
let
us
take
a
stroll
in
the
copse
and
talk
it
over
he
said
it
is
deliciously
cool
there
i
do
nt
want
to
be
cool
she
said
but
he
drew
her
gently
with
him
and
a
few
steps
took
them
into
the
shade
of
the
young
oaks
and
pines
and
there
he
paused
she
has
made
you
very
angry
he
said
and
then
almost
before
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
was
pouring
forth
the
whole
of
her
story
even
more
of
it
than
she
had
told
octavia
she
had
not
at
all
intended
to
do
it
but
she
did
it
nevertheless
i
am
to
marry
mr
francis
barold
if
he
will
take
me
she
said
with
a
bitter
little
smile
mr
francis
barold
who
is
so
much
in
love
with
me
as
you
know
his
mother
approves
of
the
match
and
sent
him
here
to
make
love
to
me
which
he
has
done
as
you
have
seen
i
have
no
money
of
my
own
but
if
i
make
a
marriage
which
pleases
him
dugald
binnie
will
probably
leave
me
his
which
it
is
thought
will
be
an
inducement
to
my
cousin
who
needs
one
if
i
marry
him
or
rather
he
marries
me
lady
theobald
thinks
mr
binnie
will
be
pleased
it
does
not
even
matter
whether
francis
is
pleased
or
not
and
of
course
i
am
out
of
the
question
but
it
is
hoped
that
it
will
please
mr
binnie
the
two
ladies
have
talked
it
over
and
decided
the
matter
i
dare
say
they
have
offered
me
to
francis
who
has
very
likely
refused
me
though
perhaps
he
may
be
persuaded
to
relent
in
time
if
i
am
very
humble
and
he
is
shown
the
advantage
of
having
mr
binnie
s
money
added
to
his
own
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
have
to
be
very
humble
indeed
that
is
what
i
learned
from
lady
theobald
last
night
and
it
is
what
i
am
going
to
talk
to
her
about
is
it
enough
to
make
one
angry
do
you
think
is
it
enough
he
did
not
tell
her
whether
he
thought
it
enough
or
not
he
looked
at
her
with
steady
eyes
lucia
he
said
i
wish
you
would
let
me
go
and
talk
with
lady
theobald
you
she
said
with
a
little
start
yes
he
answered
let
me
go
to
her
let
me
tell
her
that
instead
of
marrying
francis
barold
you
will
marry
me
if
you
will
say
yes
to
that
i
think
i
can
promise
that
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
her
any
more
the
fierce
color
died
out
of
her
cheeks
and
the
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
she
raised
her
face
with
a
pathetic
look
oh
she
whispered
you
must
be
very
sorry
for
me
i
think
you
have
been
sorry
for
me
from
the
first
i
am
desperately
in
love
with
you
he
answered
in
his
quietest
way
i
have
been
desperately
in
love
with
you
from
the
first
may
i
go
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
incredulously
then
she
faltered
yes
she
still
looked
up
at
him
and
then
in
spite
of
her
happiness
or
perhaps
because
of
it
she
suddenly
began
to
cry
softly
and
forgot
she
had
been
angry
at
all
as
he
took
her
into
his
strong
kind
arms
chapter
xxiv
the
garden
party
the
morning
of
the
garden
party
arose
bright
and
clear
and
slowbridge
awakened
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
miss
chickie
having
worked
until
midnight
that
all
her
orders
might
be
completed
was
so
overpowered
by
her
labors
as
to
have
to
take
her
tea
and
toast
in
bed
at
oldclough
varied
sentiments
prevailed
lady
theobald
s
manner
was
chiefly
distinguished
by
an
implacable
rigidity
she
had
chosen
as
an
appropriate
festal
costume
a
funereal
black
moire
antique
enlivened
by
massive
fringes
and
ornaments
of
jet
her
jewelry
being
chains
and
manacles
of
the
latter
which
rattled
as
she
moved
with
a
sound
somewhat
suggestive
of
bones
mr
dugald
binnie
who
had
received
an
invitation
had
as
yet
amiably
forborne
to
say
whether
he
would
accept
it
or
not
he
had
been
out
when
mr
burmistone
called
and
had
not
seen
him
when
lady
theobald
descended
to
breakfast
she
found
him
growling
over
his
newspaper
and
he
glanced
up
at
her
with
a
polite
scowl
going
to
a
funeral
he
demanded
i
accompany
my
granddaughter
to
this
this
entertainment
her
ladyship
responded
it
is
scarcely
a
joyous
occasion
to
my
mind
no
need
to
dress
yourself
like
that
if
it
is
nt
ejaculated
mr
binnie
why
do
nt
you
stay
at
home
if
you
do
nt
want
to
go
man
s
all
right
is
nt
he
once
knew
a
man
by
the
name
of
burmistone
myself
one
of
the
few
decent
fellows
i
ve
met
if
i
were
sure
this
was
the
same
man
i
d
go
myself
when
i
find
a
fellow
who
s
neither
knave
nor
fool
i
stick
to
him
believe
i
ll
send
to
find
out
where
s
lucia
what
his
opinion
of
lucia
was
it
was
difficult
to
discover
he
had
an
agreeable
habit
of
staring
at
her
over
the
top
of
his
paper
and
over
his
dinner
the
only
time
he
had
made
any
comment
upon
her
was
the
first
time
he
saw
her
in
the
dress
she
had
said
olly
you
ll
let
us
take
spot
she
can
go
in
my
box
now
spot
was
the
white
kitten
so
milly
and
mother
began
to
laugh
suppose
you
go
and
ask
spot
first
whether
she
d
like
it
olly

patting

chapter
ii
a
journey
north
milly
and
oliver
lived
at
willingham
a
little
town
in
oxfordshire
as
i
have
already
told
you
their
father
was
a
doctor
and
they
lived
in
an
old
fashioned
house
in
a
street
with
a
long
shady
garden
stretching
away
behind
it
milly
and
oliver
loved
their
father
and
whenever
he
put
his
brown
face
inside
the
nursery
door
two
pairs
of
little
feet
went
running
to
meet
him
and
two
pairs
of
little
hands
pulled
him
eagerly
into
the
room
but
they
saw
him
very
seldom
whereas
their
mother
was
always
with
them
teaching
them
their
lessons
playing
with
them
in
the
garden
telling
them
stories
mending
their
frocks
tucking
them
up
in
their
snug
little
beds
at
night
sometimes
praising
them
sometimes
scolding
them
always
loving
and
looking
after
them
milly
and
olly
honestly
believed
that
theirs
was
the
best
mother
in
the
whole
world
nobody
else
could
find
out
such
nice
plays
or
tell
them
such
wonderful
stories
or
dress
dolls
half
so
well
two
little
neighbours
of
theirs
jacky
and
francis
had
a
poor
sick
mother
who
always
lay
on
the
sofa
and
could
hardly
bear
to
have
her
little
boys
in
the
room
with
her
milly
and
oliver
were
never
tired
of
wondering
how
jacky
and
francis
got
on
with
a
mother
like
that
how
funny
and
how
dreadful
it
must
be
poor
jacky
and
francis
it
never
came
into
their
heads
to
say
poor
jacky
s
mother
too
but
then
you
see
they
were
such
little
people
and
little
people
have
only
room
in
their
heads
for
a
very
few
thoughts
at
a
time
however
milly
had
been
away
from
her
mother
a
good
deal
lately
about
six
months
before
my
story
begins
she
had
been
sent
to
school
to
a
kindergarten
as
she
was
taught
to
call
it
and
there
milly
had
learnt
all
kinds
of
wonderful
things
she
had
learnt
how
to
make
mats
out
of
paper
blue
mats
and
pink
mats
and
yellow
mats
and
red
mats
she
had
learned
how
to
make
a
bit
of
soft
clay
look
like
a
box
or
a
stool
or
a
bird
s
nest
with
three
clay
eggs
inside
it
she
had
begun
to
add
up
and
take
away
and
above
all
she
had
begun
to
learn
geography
and
frulein
for
milly
s
mistress
was
a
german
and
had
a
german
name
was
just
now
teaching
her
about
islands
and
lakes
and
capes
and
peninsulas
and
many
other
things
that
all
little
girls
have
to
learn
about
some
time
or
other
unless
they
wish
to
grow
up
dunces
as
for
milly
s
looks
i
have
told
you
already
that
she
had
blue
eyes
and
a
turn
up
nose
and
a
dear
sensible
little
face
and
she
had
very
thick
fair
hair
that
was
always
tumbling
about
her
eyes
and
making
her
look
as
nurse
told
her
like
a
yellow
owl
in
an
ivy
bush
milly
loved
most
people
except
perhaps
john
the
gardener
who
was
rather
cross
to
the
children
and
was
always
calling
to
them
not
to
walk
on
them
beds
and
to
be
sure
not
to
touch
any
of
his
fruit
or
flowers
she
loved
her
father
and
her
mother
she
loved
olly
with
all
her
whole
heart
though
he
was
a
tease
she
loved
her
nurse
whom
she
and
olly
called
nana
and
who
had
been
with
them
ever
since
milly
was
born
and
she
loved
frulein
and
was
always
begging
flowers
from
her
mother
that
she
might
take
them
to
school
for
frulein
s
table
so
you
see
milly
was
made
up
of
loving
and
she
was
a
thoughtful
little
girl
too
tidy
with
her
dress
quick
and
quiet
at
her
lessons
and
always
ready
to
sit
still
with
her
fairy
book
or
her
doll
when
mother
was
busy
or
tired
but
there
were
two
things
in
which
milly
was
not
at
all
sensible
in
spite
of
her
sensible
face
she
was
much
too
ready
to
cry
when
any
little
thing
went
wrong
and
she
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
creatures
of
all
sorts
she
was
afraid
of
her
father
s
big
dog
she
was
afraid
of
the
dear
brown
cow
that
lived
in
the
field
beyond
the
garden
she
was
afraid
of
earwigs
i
am
even
ashamed
to
say
she
was
afraid
of
spiders
once
she
ran
away
as
if
a
lion
were
behind
her
from
a
white
kitten
that
pulled
her
dress
with
its
frolicsome
paws
to
make
her
play
with
it
but
that
milly
would
tell
you
was
when
i
was
little
and
she
was
quite
sure
she
was
a
good
deal
braver
now
now
what
am
i
to
tell
you
about
olly
olly
was
just
a
round
ball
of
fun
and
mischief
he
had
brown
hair
brown
eyes
a
brown
face
and
brown
hands
he
was
always
touching
and
meddling
with
everything
indoors
and
out
to
see
what
was
inside
it
or
what
it
was
made
of
he
liked
teasing
milly
he
liked
his
walks
he
liked
his
sleep
in
the
morning
he
liked
his
dinner
he
liked
his
tea
he
liked
everything
in
the
world
except
learning
to
read
and
that
he
hated
he
could
only
do
one
thing
besides
mischief
he
could
sing
all
kinds
of
tunes
quick
tunes
slow
tunes
and
merry
tunes
he
had
been
able
to
sing
tunes
ever
since
he
was
quite
a
tiny
baby
and
his
father
and
mother
often
talked
together
of
how
in
about
a
year
he
should
be
taught
to
play
on
the
piano
or
perhaps
on
the
violin
if
he
liked
it
better
you
might
hear
his
sharp
shrill
little
voice
singing
about
the
from
a
vile
pestiferous
slough
i
think
it
most
probable
though
of
course
it
s
only
an
opinion
that
you
ll
all
have
the
deuce
to
pay
before
you
get
that
malaria
out
of
your
systems
camp
in
a
bog
would
you
silver
i
m
surprised
at
you
you
re
less
of
a
fool
than
many
take
you
all
round
but
you
do
nt
appear
to
me
to
have
the
rudiments
of
a
notion
of
the
rules
of
health
well
he
added
after
he
had
dosed
them
round
and
they
had
taken
his
prescriptions
with
really
laughable
humility
more
like
charity
schoolchildren
than
blood
guilty
mutineers
and
pirates
well
that
s
done
for
today
and
now
i
should
wish
to
have
a
talk
with
that
boy
please
and
he
nodded
his
head
in
my
direction
carelessly
george
merry
was
at
the
door
spitting
and
spluttering
over
some
bad
tasted
medicine
but
at
the
first
word
of
the
doctor
s
proposal
he
swung
round
with
a
deep
flush
and
cried
no
and
swore
silver
struck
the
barrel
with
his
open
hand
si
lence
he
roared
and
looked
about
him
positively
like
a
lion
doctor
he
went
on
in
his
usual
tones
i
was
a
thinking
of
that
knowing
as
how
you
had
a
fancy
for
the
boy
we
re
all
humbly
grateful
for
your
kindness
and
as
you
see
puts
faith
in
you
and
takes
the
drugs
down
like
that
much
grog
and
i
take
it
i
ve
found
a
way
as
ll
suit
all
hawkins
will
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
as
a
young
gentleman
for
a
young
gentleman
you
are
although
poor
born
your
word
of
honour
not
to
slip
your
cable
i
readily
gave
the
pledge
required
then
doctor
said
silver
you
just
step
outside
o
that
stockade
and
once
you
re
there
i
ll
bring
the
boy
down
on
the
inside
and
i
reckon
you
can
yarn
through
the
spars
good
day
to
you
sir
and
all
our
dooties
to
the
squire
and
cap
n
smollett
the
explosion
of
disapproval
which
nothing
but
silver
s
black
looks
had
restrained
broke
out
immediately
the
doctor
had
left
the
house
silver
was
roundly
accused
of
playing
double
of
trying
to
make
a
separate
peace
for
himself
of
sacrificing
the
interests
of
his
accomplices
and
victims
and
in
one
word
of
the
identical
exact
thing
that
he
was
doing
it
seemed
to
me
so
obvious
in
this
case
that
i
could
not
imagine
how
he
was
to
turn
their
anger
but
he
was
twice
the
man
the
rest
were
and
his
last
night
s
victory
had
given
him
a
huge
preponderance
on
their
minds
he
called
them
all
the
fools
and
dolts
you
can
imagine
said
it
was
necessary
i
should
talk
to
the
doctor
fluttered
the
chart
in
their
faces
asked
them
if
they
could
afford
to
break
the
treaty
the
very
day
they
were
bound
a
treasure
hunting
no
by
thunder
he
cried
it
s
us
must
break
the
treaty
when
the
time
comes
and
till
then
i
ll
gammon
that
doctor
if
i
have
to
ile
his
boots
with
brandy
and
then
he
bade
them
get
the
fire
lit
and
stalked
out
upon
his
crutch
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
leaving
them
in
a
disarray
and
silenced
by
his
volubility
rather
than
convinced
slow
lad
slow
he
said
they
might
round
upon
us
in
a
twinkle
of
an
eye
if
we
was
seen
to
hurry
very
deliberately
then
did
we
advance
across
the
sand
to
where
the
doctor
awaited
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
stockade
and
as
soon
as
we
were
within
easy
speaking
distance
silver
stopped
you
ll
make
a
note
of
this
here
also
doctor
says
he
and
the
boy
ll
tell
you
how
i
saved
his
life
and
were
deposed
for
it
too
and
you
may
lay
to
that
doctor
when
a
man
s
steering
as
near
the
wind
as
me
playing
chuck
farthing
with
the
last
breath
in
his
body
like
you
would
nt
think
it
too
much
mayhap
to
give
him
one
good
word
you
ll
please
bear
in
mind
it
s
not
my
life
only
now
it
s
that
boy
s
into
the
bargain
and
you
ll
speak
me
fair
doctor
and
give
me
a
bit
o
hope
to
go
on
for
the
sake
of
mercy
silver
was
a
changed
man
once
he
was
out
there
and
had
his
back
to
his
friends
and
the
block
house
his
cheeks
seemed
to
have
fallen
in
his
voice
trembled
never
was
a
soul
more
dead
in
earnest
why
john
you
re
not
afraid
asked
dr
livesey
doctor
i
m
no
coward
no
not
i
not
so
much
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
if
i
was
i
would
nt
say
it
but
i
ll
own
up
fairly
i
ve
the
shakes
upon
me
for
the
gallows
you
re
a
good
man
and
a
true
i
never
seen
a
better
man
and
you
ll
not
forget
what
i
done
good
not
any
more
than
you
ll
forget
the
bad
i
know
and
i
step
aside
see
here
and
leave
you
and
jim
alone
and
you
ll
put
that
down
for
me
too
for
it
s
a
long
stretch
is
that
so
saying
he
stepped
back
a
little
way
till
he
was
out
of
earshot
and
there
sat
down
upon
a
tree
stump
and
began
to
whistle
spinning
round
now
and
again
upon
his
seat
so
as
to
command
a
sight
sometimes
of
me
and
the
doctor
and
sometimes
of
his
unruly
ruffians
as
they
went
to
and
fro
in
the
sand
between
the
fire
which
they
were
busy
rekindling
and
the
house
from
which
they
brought
forth
pork
and
bread
to
make
the
breakfast
so
jim
said
the
doctor
sadly
here
you
are
as
you
have
brewed
so
shall
you
drink
my
boy
heaven
knows
i
cannot
find
it
in
my
heart
to
blame
you
but
this
much
i
will
out
her
hands
before
her
like
one
groping
his
way
what
what
is
it
she
looked
from
atherton
s
face
to
her
father
s
the
old
man
stopped
and
tried
to
smile
reassuringly
he
tried
to
speak
atherton
turned
away
it
was
halleck
who
came
forward
and
took
her
wandering
hands
he
held
them
quivering
in
his
own
and
said
gravely
and
steadily
using
her
name
for
the
first
time
in
the
deep
pity
which
cast
out
all
fear
and
shame
marcia
we
have
found
your
husband
dead
she
made
with
her
lips
he
is
alive
said
halleck
there
is
something
in
this
paper
for
you
to
see
something
you
must
see
i
can
bear
anything
if
he
is
not
dead
where
what
is
it
show
it
to
me
the
paper
shook
in
the
hands
which
halleck
released
her
eyes
strayed
blindly
over
its
columns
he
had
to
put
his
finger
on
the
place
before
she
could
find
it
then
her
tremor
ceased
and
she
seemed
without
breath
or
pulse
while
she
read
it
through
she
fetched
a
long
deep
sigh
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
eyes
as
if
to
clear
them
staying
herself
unconsciously
against
halleck
s
breast
and
laying
her
trembling
arm
along
his
arm
till
her
fingers
knit
themselves
among
his
fingers
she
read
it
a
second
time
and
a
third
then
she
dropped
the
paper
and
turned
to
look
up
at
him
why
she
cried
as
if
she
had
made
it
out
at
last
while
an
awful
joyful
light
of
hope
flashed
into
her
face
it
is
a
mistake
do
nt
you
see
he
thinks
that
i
never
came
back
he
thinks
that
i
meant
to
abandon
him
that
i
that
i
but
you
know
that
i
came
back
you
came
back
with
me
why
i
was
nt
gone
an
hour
a
half
hour
hardly
oh
bartley
poor
bartley
he
thought
i
could
leave
him
and
take
his
child
from
him
that
i
could
be
so
wicked
so
heartless
oh
no
no
no
why
i
only
stayed
away
that
little
time
because
i
was
afraid
to
go
back
do
nt
you
remember
how
i
told
you
i
was
afraid
and
wanted
you
to
come
in
with
me
her
exaltation
broke
in
a
laugh
but
we
can
explain
it
now
and
it
will
be
all
right
he
will
see
he
will
understand
i
will
tell
him
just
how
it
was
oh
flavia
flavia
we
ve
found
papa
we
ve
found
papa
quick
she
whirled
away
toward
the
stairs
but
her
father
caught
her
by
the
arm
marcia
he
shouted
in
his
old
raucous
voice
you
ve
got
to
understand
this
he
hesitated
as
if
running
over
all
terms
of
opprobrium
in
his
mind
and
he
resumed
as
if
he
had
found
them
each
too
feeble
bartley
has
nt
acted
under
any
mistake
he
set
the
facts
before
her
with
merciless
clearness
and
she
listened
with
an
audible
catching
of
the
breath
at
times
while
she
softly
smoothed
her
forehead
with
her
left
hand
i
do
nt
believe
it
she
said
when
he
had
ended
write
to
him
tell
him
what
i
say
and
you
will
see
the
old
man
uttered
something
between
a
groan
and
a
curse
oh
you
poor
crazy
child
can
nothing
make
you
understand
that
bartley
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
and
that
he
s
just
as
ready
for
one
lie
as
another
he
thinks
he
can
make
out
a
case
of
abandonment
with
the
least
trouble
and
so
he
accuses
you
of
that
but
he
d
just
as
soon
accuse
you
of
anything
else
write
to
him
you
ve
got
to
go
to
him
you
ve
got
to
go
out
there
and
fight
him
in
open
court
with
facts
and
witnesses
do
you
suppose
bartley
hubbard
wants
any
explanation
from
you
do
you
think
he
s
been
waiting
these
two
years
to
hear
that
you
did
nt
really
abandon
him
but
came
back
to
this
house
an
hour
after
you
left
it
and
that
you
ve
waited
for
him
here
ever
since
when
he
knows
that
will
he
withdraw
this
suit
of
his
and
come
home
he
ll
want
the
proof
and
the
way
to
do
is
to
go
out
there
and
let
him
have
it
if
i
had
him
on
the
stand
for
five
minutes
said
the
old
man
between
his
set
teeth
just
five
minutes
i
d
undertake
to
convince
him
from
his
own
lips
that
he
was
wrong
about
you
but
i
am
afraid
he
would
nt
mind
a
letter
you
think
i
say
so
because
i
hate
him
and
you
do
nt
believe
me
well
ask
either
of
these
gentlemen
here
whether
i
m
telling
you
the
truth
she
did
not
speak
but
with
a
glance
at
their
averted
faces
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
passed
one
hand
over
the
other
while
she
drew
her
breath
in
long
shuddering
respirations
and
stared
at
the
floor
with
knit
brows
and
starting
eyes
like
one
stifling
a
deadly
pang
she
made
several
attempts
to
speak
before
she
could
utter
any
sound
then
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
her
father
s
let
us
let
us
go
home
oh
let
us
go
home
i
will
give
him
up
i
had
given
him
up
already
i
told
you
she
said
turning
to
halleck
and
speaking
in
a
slow
gentle
tone
only
an
hour
ago
that
he
was
dead
and
this
this
that
s
happened
it
makes
no
difference
why
did
you
bring
the
paper
to
me
when
you
knew
that
i
thought
he
was
dead
god
knows
i
wished
to
keep
it
from
you
well
no
matter
now
let
him
go
free
if
he
wants
to
i
ca
nt
help
it
you
can
help
it
interrupted
her
father
you
ve
got
the
facts
on
your
side
and
you
ve
got
the
witnesses
would
you
go
out
with
me
and
tell
him
that
i
never
meant
to
leave
him
she
asked
simply
as
you
please
only
never
forget
that
i
pointed
out
to
you
the
right
course
in
time
thank
you
ram
lal
for
your
friendly
concern
in
my
behalf
i
do
not
think
i
shall
act
as
you
suggest
but
i
am
nevertheless
grateful
to
you
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
and
consult
you
about
however
my
friend
what
is
the
use
of
my
giving
you
advice
that
you
will
not
follow
if
i
lived
with
you
and
were
your
constant
companion
you
would
ask
me
to
advise
you
twenty
times
a
day
and
then
you
would
go
and
do
the
diametric
opposite
of
what
i
suggested
if
i
did
not
see
in
you
something
that
i
see
in
few
other
men
i
would
not
be
here
there
are
plenty
of
fools
who
have
wit
enough
to
take
counsel
of
a
wise
man
there
are
few
men
of
wit
wise
enough
to
be
guided
by
their
betters
as
if
they
were
only
fools
for
the
time
yet
because
you
are
so
wayward
i
will
help
you
once
or
twice
more
and
then
i
will
leave
you
to
your
own
course
which
you
in
your
blindness
will
call
your
kismet
not
seeing
that
your
fate
is
continually
in
your
own
hands
more
so
at
this
moment
than
ever
before
ask
and
i
will
answer
thanks
ram
lal
it
is
this
i
would
know
you
are
aware
that
i
have
undertaken
a
novel
kind
of
bargain
the
man
you
wot
of
is
to
be
delivered
to
me
near
keitung
i
am
anxious
for
the
man
s
safety
afterwards
and
i
would
be
glad
of
some
hint
about
disposing
of
him
i
must
go
alone
for
i
do
not
want
any
witness
of
what
i
am
going
to
do
and
as
a
mere
matter
of
personal
safety
for
myself
and
the
man
i
am
going
to
set
free
i
must
decide
on
some
plan
of
action
when
i
meet
the
band
of
sowars
who
will
escort
him
they
are
capable
of
murdering
us
both
if
the
maharajah
instructs
them
to
as
long
as
i
am
alive
to
bring
the
old
man
into
disgrace
with
the
british
the
captive
is
safe
but
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
for
those
fellows
to
dispose
of
us
together
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
business
of
course
they
could
replied
ram
lal
adding
in
an
ironical
tone
and
if
you
insist
upon
putting
your
head
down
the
tiger
s
throat
how
do
you
expect
me
to
prevent
the
brute
from
snapping
it
off
that
would
be
a
phenomenon
would
it
not
and
only
this
evening
you
were
saying
that
you
despised
phenomena
i
said
that
such
things
were
indifferent
to
me
i
did
not
say
i
despised
them
but
i
think
that
this
thing
may
be
done
without
performing
any
miracles
if
it
were
not
such
a
good
action
on
your
part
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
since
you
mean
to
risk
your
neck
for
your
own
peculiar
views
of
what
is
right
i
will
endeavour
that
you
shall
not
break
it
i
will
meet
you
a
day
s
journey
before
you
reach
keitung
somewhere
on
the
road
and
we
will
go
together
and
do
the
business
but
if
i
am
to
help
you
i
will
not
promise
not
to
perform
some
miracles
as
you
call
them
though
you
know
very
well
they
are
no
such
thing
meanwhile
do
as
you
please
about
the
tiger
hunt
i
shall
say
no
more
about
it
he
paused
and
then
withdrawing
one
delicate
hand
from
the
folds
of
his
caftn
he
pointed
to
the
wall
behind
isaacs
and
me
and
said
what
a
very
singular
piece
of
workmanship
is
that
yataghan
we
both
naturally
turned
half
round
to
look
at
the
weapon
he
spoke
of
which
was
the
central
piece
in
a
trophy
of
jewelled
sabres
and
afghan
knives
yes
said
isaacs
turning
back
to
answer
his
guest
it
is
a
he
stopped
and
i
who
had
not
seen
the
weapon
before
lost
among
so
many
and
was
admiring
its
singular
beauty
turned
too
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
that
isaacs
was
gazing
into
empty
space
the
divan
where
ram
lal
had
been
sitting
an
instant
before
was
vacant
he
was
gone
that
is
rather
sudden
i
said
more
so
than
usual
was
the
reply
did
you
see
him
go
did
he
go
out
by
the
door
not
i
i
answered
when
i
looked
round
at
the
wall
he
was
placidly
sitting
on
that
divan
pointing
with
one
hand
at
the
yataghan
does
he
generally
go
so
quickly
yes
more
or
less
now
i
will
show
you
some
pretty
sport
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
door
narain
he
cried
narain
the
bearer
who
was
squatting
against
the
door
post
outside
sprang
up
and
stood
before
his
master
narain
why
did
you
not
show
that
pundit
the
way
downstairs
what
do
you
mean
have
you
no
manners
narain
stood
open
mouthed
what
pundit
sahib
he
asked
why
the
pundit
who
came
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
you
donkey
he
has
just
gone
out
and
you
did
not
even
get
up
and
make
a
salaam
you
impertinent
vagabond
narain
protested
that
no
pundit
or
sahib
or
any
one
else
had
passed
the
threshold
since
ram
lal
had
entered
ha
you
budmash
you
lazy
dog
of
a
hindoo
you
have
been
asleep
again
you
swine
you
son
of
a
pig
you
father
of
piglings
is
that
the
way
you
do
your
work
in
my
service
isaacs
was
enjoying
the
joke
in
a
quiet
way
immensely
sahib
said
the
trembling
narain
apparently
forgetting
the
genealogy
his
master
had
thrust
upon
him
sahib
you
are
protector
of
the
poor
you
are
my
father
and
my
mother
and
my
brother
and
all
my
relations
the
common
form
of
hindoo
supplication
but
sri
krishnaji
by
the
blessed
krishna
i
have
not
slept
arrange
the
quarrel
but
the
stillness
remained
unbroken
save
by
the
sea
gulls
and
the
surf
i
had
a
weight
at
my
heart
when
we
desisted
and
i
saw
that
even
northmour
was
unusually
pale
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
nervously
as
though
he
feared
that
some
one
had
crept
between
him
and
the
pavilion
door
by
god
he
said
in
a
whisper
this
is
too
much
for
me
i
replied
in
the
same
key
suppose
there
should
be
none
after
all
look
there
he
returned
nodding
with
his
head
as
though
he
had
been
afraid
to
point
i
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
and
there
from
the
northern
quarter
of
the
sea
wood
beheld
a
thin
column
of
smoke
rising
steadily
against
the
now
cloudless
sky
northmour
i
said
we
still
continued
to
talk
in
whispers
it
is
not
possible
to
endure
this
suspense
i
prefer
death
fifty
times
over
stay
you
here
to
watch
the
pavilion
i
will
go
forward
and
make
sure
if
i
have
to
walk
right
into
their
camp
he
looked
once
again
all
round
him
with
puckered
eyes
and
then
nodded
assentingly
to
my
proposal
my
heart
beat
like
a
sledge
hammer
as
i
set
out
walking
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
smoke
and
though
up
to
that
moment
i
had
felt
chill
and
shivering
i
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
glow
of
heat
over
all
my
body
the
ground
in
this
direction
was
very
uneven
a
hundred
men
might
have
lain
hidden
in
as
many
square
yards
about
my
path
but
i
had
not
practised
the
business
in
vain
chose
such
routes
as
cut
at
the
very
root
of
concealment
and
by
keeping
along
the
most
convenient
ridges
commanded
several
hollows
at
a
time
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
rewarded
for
my
caution
coming
suddenly
on
to
a
mound
somewhat
more
elevated
than
the
surrounding
hummocks
i
saw
not
thirty
yards
away
a
man
bent
almost
double
and
running
as
fast
as
his
attitude
permitted
along
the
bottom
of
a
gully
i
had
dislodged
one
of
the
spies
from
his
ambush
as
soon
as
i
sighted
him
i
called
loudly
both
in
english
and
italian
and
he
seeing
concealment
was
no
longer
possible
straightened
himself
out
leaped
from
the
gully
and
made
off
as
straight
as
an
arrow
for
the
borders
of
the
wood
it
was
none
of
my
business
to
pursue
i
had
learned
what
i
wanted
that
we
were
beleaguered
and
watched
in
the
pavilion
and
i
returned
at
once
and
walking
as
nearly
as
possible
in
my
old
footsteps
to
where
northmour
awaited
me
beside
the
despatch
box
he
was
even
paler
than
when
i
had
left
him
and
his
voice
shook
a
little
could
you
see
what
he
was
like
he
asked
he
kept
his
back
turned
i
replied
let
us
get
into
the
house
frank
i
do
nt
think
i
m
a
coward
but
i
can
stand
no
more
of
this
he
whispered
all
was
still
and
sunshiny
about
the
pavilion
as
we
turned
to
re
enter
it
even
the
gulls
had
flown
in
a
wider
circuit
and
were
seen
flickering
along
the
beach
and
sand
hills
and
this
loneliness
terrified
me
more
than
a
regiment
under
arms
it
was
not
until
the
door
was
barricaded
that
i
could
draw
a
full
inspiration
and
relieve
the
weight
that
lay
upon
my
bosom
northmour
and
i
exchanged
a
steady
glance
and
i
suppose
each
made
his
own
reflections
on
the
white
and
startled
aspect
of
the
other
you
were
right
i
said
all
is
over
shake
hands
old
man
for
the
last
time
yes
replied
he
i
will
shake
hands
for
as
sure
as
i
am
here
i
bear
no
malice
but
remember
if
by
some
impossible
accident
we
should
give
the
slip
to
these
blackguards
i
ll
take
the
upper
hand
of
you
by
fair
or
foul
oh
said
i
you
weary
me
he
seemed
hurt
and
walked
away
in
silence
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
where
he
paused
you
do
not
understand
said
he
i
am
not
a
swindler
and
i
guard
myself
that
is
all
it
may
weary
you
or
not
mr
cassilis
i
do
not
care
a
rush
i
speak
for
my
own
satisfaction
and
not
for
your
amusement
you
had
better
go
upstairs
and
court
the
girl
for
my
part
i
stay
here
and
i
stay
with
you
i
returned
do
you
think
i
would
steal
a
march
even
with
your
permission
frank
he
said
smiling
it
s
a
pity
you
are
an
ass
for
you
have
the
makings
of
a
man
i
think
i
must
be
fey
to
day
you
cannot
irritate
me
even
when
you
try
do
you
know
he
continued
softly
i
think
we
are
the
two
most
miserable
men
in
england
you
and
i
we
have
got
on
to
thirty
without
wife
or
child
or
so
much
as
a
shop
to
look
after
poor
pitiful
lost
devils
both
and
now
we
clash
about
a
girl
as
if
there
were
not
several
millions
in
the
united
kingdom
ah
frank
frank
the
one
who
loses
this
throw
be
it
you
or
me
he
has
my
pity
it
were
better
for
him
how
does
the
bible
say
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
he
were
cast
into
the
depth
of
the
sea
let
us
take
a
drink
he
concluded
suddenly
but
without
any
levity
of
tone
i
was
touched
by
his
words
and
consented
he
sat
down
on
the
table
in
the
dining
room
and
held
up
the
glass
of
sherry
to
his
eye
if
you
beat
me
frank
he
said
i
shall
take
to
drink
what
will
you
do
if
it
goes
the
other
way
god
knows
i
returned
well
said
he
here
is
a
toast
in
the
meantime
italia
irredenta
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
passed
in
the
same
dreadful
tedium
and
suspense
i
laid
the
table
for
dinner
while
northmour
and
clara
said
but
come
let
us
go
to
her
at
once
they
found
her
still
sleeping
but
not
profoundly
her
face
was
unnaturally
flushed
and
wore
a
troubled
expression
while
her
breathing
seemed
labored
as
they
stood
anxiously
regarding
her
she
woke
with
a
sharp
cry
of
distress
and
anguish
then
catching
sight
of
her
husband
bending
over
her
her
face
grew
radiant
and
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
o
ned
dear
ned
she
cried
are
you
here
and
do
you
love
me
yet
dearly
dearly
my
darling
he
said
holding
her
close
what
has
troubled
you
oh
such
a
dreadful
dream
i
thought
i
was
all
alone
in
a
desert
and
could
nt
find
you
anywhere
but
drames
always
go
by
conthraries
my
dear
he
quoted
sportively
then
more
seriously
are
you
quite
well
love
he
asked
a
little
dull
and
a
trifle
headachy
she
answered
smiling
up
at
him
but
i
think
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
drive
with
my
husband
in
the
sweet
morning
air
will
cure
me
you
shall
have
both
with
the
least
possible
delay
what
time
is
it
have
you
been
to
breakfast
it
s
about
nine
and
i
have
taken
breakfast
i
think
you
must
have
some
before
exerting
yourself
to
dress
just
as
you
say
it
s
nice
to
have
you
tell
me
what
to
do
she
said
nestling
closer
in
his
arms
i
ca
nt
think
why
i
should
ever
have
disliked
it
i
presume
it
was
all
the
fault
of
my
tone
and
manner
sometimes
of
my
words
too
he
said
passing
his
hand
caressingly
over
her
hair
and
cheek
i
m
afraid
i
ve
been
decidedly
bearish
on
several
occasions
but
i
trust
i
shall
have
the
grace
to
treat
my
wife
with
politeness
and
consideration
after
this
elsie
who
had
left
the
room
on
zoe
s
awaking
now
came
in
and
bidding
her
an
affectionate
good
morning
said
she
had
ordered
her
breakfast
to
be
brought
up
at
once
adding
i
hope
you
will
do
it
justice
my
dear
i
ll
see
that
she
does
mamma
edward
answered
for
her
in
sportive
tone
she
has
made
such
fair
promises
of
submission
obedience
and
all
that
that
she
ll
hardly
dare
refuse
to
do
anything
i
bid
her
i
have
nt
been
very
good
about
it
lately
mamma
zoe
said
looking
half
tearfully
half
smilingly
from
one
to
the
other
but
ned
s
forgiven
me
and
now
i
feel
as
you
say
you
did
that
it
s
a
real
pleasure
to
give
up
my
wishes
to
one
i
love
so
very
dearly
and
who
is
i
know
very
much
wiser
than
i
that
is
right
dear
elsie
said
tenderly
and
i
trust
he
will
show
himself
worthy
of
all
your
love
and
confidence
the
two
now
comported
themselves
like
a
pair
of
lovers
as
indeed
they
had
done
through
all
their
brief
married
life
except
the
last
few
days
edward
exerted
himself
for
the
entertainment
of
his
little
wife
during
their
drive
and
was
very
tender
and
careful
of
her
on
their
return
he
bade
her
lie
down
on
the
sofa
in
her
boudoir
and
rest
averring
that
she
looked
languid
and
unlike
herself
to
please
you
she
said
obeying
the
mandate
with
a
smiling
glance
up
into
his
face
that
s
a
good
child
he
responded
sitting
down
beside
her
and
smoothing
her
hair
with
fond
caressing
hand
now
what
shall
i
do
to
please
you
stay
here
close
beside
me
and
hold
my
hand
and
talk
to
me
very
well
he
answered
closing
his
fingers
over
the
hand
she
put
into
his
then
lifting
it
to
his
lips
how
your
face
has
changed
love
since
that
frightened
look
you
gave
me
when
i
came
in
with
the
lamp
last
night
how
frightened
and
ashamed
i
was
ned
she
exclaimed
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
i
felt
that
you
had
a
right
to
beat
me
if
you
wanted
to
and
i
should
nt
have
said
a
word
if
you
d
done
it
but
you
could
nt
have
feared
that
he
said
with
a
pained
look
and
coloring
deeply
no
oh
no
indeed
i
know
you
would
never
do
that
but
i
dreaded
what
you
might
say
and
did
not
at
all
expect
you
would
be
so
kind
and
forgiving
and
loving
to
me
but
how
was
i
brought
up
here
i
knew
nothing
from
the
instant
you
were
at
my
side
on
the
door
step
till
i
saw
you
coming
in
with
the
lamp
in
your
husband
s
arms
what
a
heavy
load
for
you
to
carry
she
said
looking
at
him
with
concern
no
not
at
all
i
did
it
with
perfect
ease
except
for
the
darkness
and
the
fear
that
you
might
recover
consciousness
on
the
way
and
scream
out
with
affright
before
you
discovered
who
your
captor
was
my
husband
my
dear
kind
husband
she
murmured
softly
stroking
his
face
as
he
bent
over
her
to
press
a
kiss
upon
her
forehead
my
darling
little
wife
he
returned
then
after
a
moment
s
silent
exchange
of
caresses
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
you
were
going
and
what
you
intended
to
do
he
asked
with
a
half
smile
i
have
no
right
to
refuse
if
you
require
a
full
confession
she
said
half
playfully
half
tearfully
and
blushing
deeply
i
do
nt
require
it
but
should
like
to
have
it
nevertheless
for
i
confess
my
curiosity
is
piqued
he
said
with
an
amused
yet
tender
look
and
tone
there
is
nt
really
very
much
to
tell
she
sighed
only
that
because
i
was
dreadfully
unhappy
and
had
worked
myself
up
to
believing
that
i
was
a
hated
wife
a
burden
and
annoyance
to
my
husband
i
thought
it
would
be
an
act
of
noble
self
sacrifice
to
run
away
and
o
ned
please
do
nt
laugh
at
me
i
am
not
laughing
love
he
said
in
soothing
half
tremulous
tones
taking
her
in
his
maud
she
lifted
a
bright
glance
through
her
tears
and
said
like
a
happy
child
to
whom
a
new
game
has
been
proposed
what
shall
we
try
simple
as
the
words
were
both
of
them
seemed
to
feel
that
a
certain
relation
a
certain
responsibility
had
been
established
between
them
the
thought
exhilarated
maud
it
seemed
the
beginning
of
her
long
expected
romance
while
the
glow
of
kind
feeling
about
the
heart
of
farnham
could
not
keep
him
from
suspecting
that
he
was
taking
a
very
imprudent
step
but
they
sat
a
good
while
discussing
various
plans
for
maud
s
advantage
and
arriving
at
nothing
definite
for
her
own
ideas
were
based
upon
a
dime
novel
theory
of
the
world
and
farnham
at
last
concluded
that
he
would
be
forced
finally
to
choose
some
way
of
life
for
his
protegee
and
then
persuade
her
to
accept
it
he
grew
silent
and
thoughtful
with
this
reflection
and
the
conversation
languished
he
was
trying
to
think
how
he
could
help
her
without
these
continued
interviews
at
his
house
when
she
disposed
of
the
difficulty
by
rising
briskly
and
saying
well
i
will
call
again
in
a
day
or
two
about
this
hour
yes
if
it
suits
you
best
he
answered
with
a
troubled
brow
he
followed
her
to
the
door
as
she
went
out
she
said
may
i
pick
a
flower
as
i
go
he
seized
his
hat
and
said
come
with
me
to
the
rose
house
in
the
garden
and
you
shall
have
something
better
they
walked
together
down
the
gravel
paths
through
the
neat
and
well
kept
garden
where
the
warm
spring
sunshine
was
calling
life
out
of
the
tender
turf
and
the
air
was
full
of
delicate
odors
she
seemed
as
gay
and
happy
as
a
child
on
a
holiday
her
disappointment
of
an
hour
ago
was
all
gone
in
the
feeling
that
arthur
was
interested
in
her
was
caring
for
her
future
without
any
definite
hopes
or
dreams
she
felt
as
if
the
world
was
suddenly
grown
richer
and
wider
something
good
was
coming
to
her
certainly
something
good
had
come
for
was
she
not
walking
in
this
lovely
garden
with
its
handsome
proprietor
who
was
she
even
began
to
think
her
friend
the
turf
was
as
soft
the
air
as
mild
the
sun
as
bright
as
in
any
of
her
romances
and
the
figure
of
farnham
s
wealth
which
she
had
heard
from
her
father
rang
musically
in
her
mind
they
went
into
the
rose
house
and
he
gave
her
two
or
three
splendid
satiny
marechal
niels
and
then
a
jacqueminot
so
big
so
rich
and
lustrous
in
its
dark
beauty
that
she
could
not
help
crying
out
with
delight
he
was
pleased
with
her
joy
and
gave
her
another
for
your
hair
he
said
she
colored
with
pleasure
till
her
cheek
was
like
the
royal
flower
hallo
thought
farnham
to
himself
she
does
not
take
these
things
as
a
matter
of
course
when
they
came
into
the
garden
again
he
made
the
suggestion
which
had
been
in
his
mind
for
the
last
half
hour
if
you
are
going
home
the
nearest
way
will
be
by
the
garden
gate
into
bishop
s
lane
it
is
only
a
minute
from
there
to
dean
street
why
that
would
be
perfectly
lovely
but
where
is
the
gate
i
will
show
you
they
walked
together
to
the
lower
end
of
the
lawn
where
a
long
line
of
glass
houses
built
against
the
high
wall
which
separated
the
garden
from
the
street
called
bishop
s
lane
sheltered
the
grapes
and
the
pine
apples
at
the
end
of
this
conservatory
in
the
wall
was
a
little
door
of
thin
but
strong
steel
plates
concealed
from
sight
by
a
row
of
pear
trees
farnham
opened
it
and
said
if
you
like
you
can
come
in
by
this
way
it
is
never
locked
in
the
daytime
it
will
save
you
a
long
walk
thanks
she
replied
that
will
be
perfectly
lovely
her
resources
of
expression
were
not
copious
but
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
spoke
volumes
of
joy
and
gratitude
her
hands
were
full
of
roses
and
as
she
raised
her
beautiful
face
to
him
with
pleasure
flashing
from
her
warm
cheeks
and
lips
and
eyes
she
seemed
to
exhale
something
of
the
vigorous
life
and
impulse
of
the
spring
sunshine
farnham
felt
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
stoop
and
kiss
the
blooming
flower
like
face
and
in
her
exalted
condition
she
would
have
thought
little
more
of
it
than
a
blush
rose
thinks
of
the
same
treatment
but
he
refrained
and
said
good
morning
because
she
seemed
in
no
mood
to
say
it
first
good
by
for
a
day
or
two
she
said
gayly
as
she
bent
her
head
to
pass
under
the
low
lintel
of
the
gate
farnham
walked
back
to
the
house
not
at
all
satisfied
with
himself
i
wonder
whether
i
have
mended
matters
she
is
certainly
too
pretty
a
girl
to
be
running
in
and
out
of
my
front
door
in
the
sight
of
all
the
avenue
how
much
better
will
it
be
for
her
to
use
the
private
entrance
and
come
and
go
by
a
sort
of
stealth
but
then
she
does
not
regard
it
that
way
she
is
so
ignorant
of
this
wicked
world
that
it
seems
to
her
merely
a
saving
of
ten
minutes
walk
around
the
block
well
all
there
is
of
it
i
must
find
a
place
for
her
before
she
domesticates
herself
here
the
thought
of
what
should
be
done
with
her
remained
persistently
with
him
and
kept
him
irritated
by
the
vision
of
her
provoking
and
useless
beauty
if
she
were
a
princess
he
thought
all
the
poets
would
be
twanging
their
lyres
about
her
all
the
artists
would
be
dying
to
paint
her
she
would
have
songs
made
to
her
and

sealed
his

showed

the

in

during
the
cooler
half
of
the
year
of
large
numbers
of
mercantile
men
from
all
parts
of
the
world
who
did
not
accept
the
fever
plagued
city
as
their
permanent
residence
made
much
business
for
the
renters
of
furnished
apartments
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
class
of
persons
whose
residence
was
permanent
and
to
whom
this
letting
of
rooms
fell
by
an
easy
and
natural
gravitation
and
the
most
respectable
and
comfortable
rented
rooms
of
which
the
city
could
boast
were
those

by

powder
generations
of
domestic
service
under
ladies
of
gallic
blood
had
brought
many
of
them
to
a
supreme
pitch
of
excellence
as
housekeepers
in
many
cases
money
had
been
inherited
in
other
cases
it
had
been
saved
up
that

ability
to
hold
an
awkward
position
with
impregnable
serenity
and
like
the

to
give
back

that
bright

ability
that
comes
of
the

added
again
to
their
excellence

or
whatever
the

was
in

of

that
presented

brick
front
directly
upon

with

little

by

from

and
twirling
in

that
the
sick
wife
lay
a
waiting
slave
girl
opened
the
door
as
the
two
men
approached
it
and
both
of
them
went
directly
upstairs
and
into
a
large
airy
room
on
a
high
finely
carved
and
heavily
hung
mahogany
bed
to
which
the
remaining
furniture
corresponded
in
ancient
style
and
massiveness
was
stretched
the
form
of
a
pale
sweet
faced
little
woman
the
proprietress
of
the
house
was
sitting
beside
the
bed
a
quadroon
of
good
kind
face
forty
five
years
old
or
so
tall
and
broad
she
rose
and
responded
to
the
doctor
s
silent
bow
with
that
pretty
dignity
of
greeting
which
goes
with
all
french
blood
and
remained
standing
the
invalid
stirred
the
physician
came
forward
to
the
bedside
the
patient
could
not
have
been
much
over
nineteen
years
of
age
her
face
was
very
pleasing
a
trifle
slender
in
outline
the
brows
somewhat
square
not
wide
the
mouth
small
she
would
not
have
been
called
beautiful
even
in
health
by
those
who
lay
stress
on
correctness
of
outlines
but
she
had
one
thing
that
to
some
is
better
whether
it
was
in
the
dark
blue
eyes
that
were
lifted
to
the
doctor
s
with
a
look
which
changed
rapidly
from
inquiry
to
confidence
or
in
the
fine
scarcely
perceptible
strands
of
pale
brown
hair
that
played
about
her
temples
he
did
not
make
out
but
for
one
cause
or
another
her
face
was
of
that
kind
which
almost
any
one
has
seen
once
or
twice
and
no
one
has
seen
often
that
seems
to
give
out
a
soft
but
veritable
light
she
was
very
weak
her
eyes
quickly
dropped
away
from
his
and
turned
wearily
but
peacefully
to
those
of
her
husband
the
doctor
spoke
to
her
his
greeting
and
gentle
inquiry
were
full
of
a
soothing
quality
that
was
new
to
the
young
man
his
long
fingers
moved
twice
or
thrice
softly
across
her
brow
pushing
back
the
thin
waving
strands
and
then
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
continuing
his
kind
direct
questions
the
answers
were
all
bad
he
turned
his
glance
to
the
quadroon
she
understood
it
the
patient
was
seriously
ill
the
nurse
responded
with
a
quiet
look
of
comprehension
at
the
same
time
the
doctor
disguised
from
the
young
strangers
this
interchange
of
meanings
by
an
audible
question
to
the
quadroon
have
i
ever
met
you
before
no
seh
what
is
your
name
zenobie
madame
zenobie
softly
whispered
the
invalid
turning
her
eyes
with
a
glimmer
of
feeble
pleasantry
first
to
the
quadroon
and
then
to
her
husband
the
physician
smiled
at
her
an
instant
and
then
gave
a
few
concise
directions
to
the
quadroon
get
me
thus
and
so
the
woman
went
and
came
she
was
a
superior
nurse
like
so
many
of
her
race
so
obvious
indeed
was
this
that
when
she
gently
pressed
the
young
husband
an
inch
or
two
aside
and
murmured
that
de
doctah
wanted
him
to
go
h
out
he
left
the
room
although
he
knew
the
physician
had
not
so
indicated
by
and
by
he
returned
but
only
at
her
beckon
and
remained
at
the
bedside
while
madame
zenobie
led
the
doctor
into
another
room
to
write
his
prescription
who
are
these
people
asked
the
physician
in
an
undertone
looking
up
at
the
quadroon
and
pausing
with
the
prescription
half
torn
off
she
shrugged
her
large
shoulders
and
smiled
perplexedly
mizzez
reechin
the
tone
was
one
of
query
rather
than
assertion
dey
sesso
she
added
she
might
nurse
the
lady
like
a
mother
but
she
was
not
going
to
be
responsible
for
the
genuineness
of
a
stranger
s
name
where
are
they
from
i
dunno
of
the
room
and
she
was
lying
on
the
outside
dressed
in
a
wonderful
dressing
gown
that
looked
like
a
fleecy
cloud
her
golden
hair
fell
in
fluffy
curls
over
her
white
forehead
and
neck
her
cheeks
flushed
delicately
her
eyes
beamed
with
joy
and
the
children
told
their
mother
afterwards
that
she
looked
as
beautiful
as
the
angels
in
the
picture
books
there
was
a
great
bustle
behind
a
huge
screen
in
another
part
of
the
room
and
at
half
past
five
this
was
taken
away
and
the
christmas
dinner
table
stood
revealed
what
a
wonderful
sight
it
was
to
the
poor
little
ruggles
children
who
ate
their
sometimes
scanty
meals
on
the
kitchen
table
it
blazed
with
tall
colored
candles
it
gleamed
with
glass
and
silver
it
blushed
with
flowers
it
groaned
with
good
things
to
eat
so
it
was
not
strange
that
the
ruggleses
forgetting
altogether
that
their
mother
was
a
mcgrill
shrieked
in
admiration
of
the
fairy
spectacle
but
larry
s
behavior
was
the
most
disgraceful
for
he
stood
not
upon
the
order
of
his
going
but
went
at
once
for
a
high
chair
that
pointed
unmistakably
to
him
climbed
up
like
a
squirrel
gave
a
comprehensive
look
at
the
turkey
clapped
his
hands
in
ecstasy
rested
his
fat
arms
on
the
table
and
cried
with
joy
i
beat
the
hull
lot
o
yer
carol
laughed
until
she
cried
giving
orders
meanwhile
uncle
jack
please
sit
at
the
head
sarah
maud
at
the
foot
and
that
will
leave
four
on
each
side
mamma
is
going
to
help
elfrida
so
that
the
children
need
not
look
after
each
other
but
just
have
a
good
time
a
sprig
of
holly
lay
by
each
plate
and
nothing
would
do
but
each
little
ruggles
must
leave
his
seat
and
have
it
pinned
on
by
carol
and
as
each
course
was
served
one
of
them
pleaded
to
take
something
to
her
there
was
hurrying
to
and
fro
i
can
assure
you
for
it
is
quite
a
difficult
matter
to
serve
a
christmas
dinner
on
the
third
floor
of
a
great
city
house
but
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
carry
every
dish
up
a
rope
ladder
the
servants
would
gladly
have
done
so
there
were
turkey
and
chicken
with
delicious
gravy
and
stuffing
and
there
were
half
a
dozen
vegetables
with
cranberry
jelly
and
celery
and
pickles
and
as
for
the
way
these
delicacies
were
served
the
ruggleses
never
forgot
it
as
long
as
they
lived
peter
nudged
kitty
who
sat
next
him
and
said
look
will
yer
ev
ry
feller
s
got
his

partic
lar
butter
i

pose
that

to
show

whispered
kitty
an
the

marked
with
big
red
letters
i

if

so
nobody

peoria
in
wild
excitement
hi
yah
i
got
a
wish
bone
sang
larry
regardless
of
sarah
maud
s
frown
after
which
she
asked
to
have
his
seat
changed
giving
as
excuse
that
he
gen
ally
set
beside
her
an
would
feel
strange
the
true
reason
being
that
she
desired
to
kick
him
gently
under
the
table
whenever
he
passed
what
might
be
termed
the
mcgrill
line
i
declare
to
goodness
murmured
susan
on
the
other
side
there
s
so
much
to
look
at
i
ca
nt
scarcely
eat
nothin
bet
yer
life
i
can
said
peter
who
had
kept
one
servant
busily
employed
ever
since
he
sat
down
for
luckily
no
one
was
asked
by
uncle
jack
whether
he
would
have
a
second
helping
but
the
dishes
were
quietly
passed
under
their
noses
and
not
a
single
ruggles
refused
anything
that
was
offered
him
even
unto
the
seventh
time
then
when
carol
and
uncle
jack
perceived
that
more
turkey
was
a
physical
impossibility
the
meats
were
taken
off
and
the
dessert
was
brought
in
a
dessert
that
would
have
frightened
a
strong
man
after
such
a
dinner
as
had
preceded
it
not
so
the
ruggleses
for
a
strong
man
is
nothing
to
a
small
boy
and
they
kindled
to
the
dessert
as
if
the
turkey
had
been
a
dream
and
the
six
vegetables
an
optical
delusion
there
were
plum
pudding
mince
pie
and
ice
cream
and
there
were
nuts
and
raisins
and
oranges
kitty
chose
ice
cream
explaining
that
she
knew
it
by
sight
though
she
had
nt
never
tasted
none
but
all
the
rest
took
the
entire
variety
without
any
regard
to
consequences
my
dear
child
whispered
uncle
jack
as
he
took
carol
an
orange
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
necessity
of
this
feast
but
i
do
advise
you
after
this
to
have
them
twice
a
year
or
quarterly
perhaps
for
the
way
these
children
eat
is
positively
dangerous
i
assure
you
i
tremble
for
that
terrible
peoria
i
m
going
to
run
races
with
her
after
dinner
never
mind
laughed
carol
let
them
have
enough
for
once
it
does
my
heart
good
to
see
them
and
they
shall
come
oftener
next
year
the
feast
being
over
the
ruggleses
lay
back
in
their
chairs
languidly
like
little
gorged
boa
constrictors
and
the
table
was
cleared
in
a
trice
then
a
door
was
opened
into
the
next
room
and
there
in
a
corner
facing
carol
s
bed
which
had
been
wheeled
as
close
as
possible
stood
the
brilliantly
lighted
christmas
tree
glittering
with
gilded
walnuts
and
tiny
silver
balloons
and
wreathed
with
snowy
chains
of
pop
corn
the
presents
had
been
bought
mostly
with
carol
s
story
money
and
were
selected
after
long
consultations
with
mrs
bird
each
girl
had
a
blue
knitted
hood
and
each
boy
a
red
crocheted
comforter
all
made
by
me
mr
bingham
she
said
presently
how
can
a
woman
earn
her
living
i
mean
a
girl
like
myself
without
any
special
qualifications
some
of
them
get
on
well
he
answered
that
depends
upon
the
girl
what
sort
of
a
living
do
you
mean
you
are
earning
a
living
now
of
a
kind
yes
but
sometimes
if
only
i
could
manage
it
i
think
that
i
should
like
to
get
away
from
here
and
take
another
line
something
bigger
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
ever
shall
but
i
like
to
think
of
it
sometimes
i
only
know
of
two
things
which
a
woman
can
turn
to
he
said
the
stage
and
literature
of
course
he
added
hastily
the
first
is
out
of
the
question
in
your
case
and
so
is
the
other
i
am
afraid
she
answered
shaking
her
head
that
is
if
by
literature
you
mean
imaginative
writing
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
only
way
to
get
into
notice
as
i
told
you
i
lost
my
imagination
well
to
be
frank
when
i
lost
my
faith
at
one
time
i
used
to
have
plenty
as
i
used
to
have
plenty
of
faith
but
the
one
went
with
the
other
i
do
not
understand
why
do
nt
you
i
think
i
do
a
mind
without
religious
sentiment
is
like
a
star
without
atmosphere
brighter
than
other
stars
but
not
so
soft
to
see
religion
poetry
music
imagination
and
even
some
of
the
more
exalted
forms
of
passion
flourish
in
the
same
soil
and
are
i
sometimes
think
different
manifestations
of
the
same
thing
do
you
know
it
is
ridiculous
to
hear
you
talk
of
having
lost
your
faith
because
i
do
nt
believe
it
at
the
worst
it
has
gone
to
sleep
and
will
wake
up
again
one
day
possibly
you
may
not
accept
some
particular
form
of
faith
but
i
tell
you
frankly
that
to
reject
all
religion
simply
because
you
cannot
understand
it
is
nothing
but
a
form
of
atrocious
spiritual
vanity
your
mind
is
too
big
for
you
miss
granger
it
has
run
away
with
you
but
you
know
it
is
tied
by
a
string
it
cannot
go
far
and
now
perhaps
you
will
be
angry
again
no
indeed
why
should
i
be
angry
i
daresay
that
you
are
quite
right
and
i
only
hope
that
i
may
be
able
to
believe
again
i
will
tell
you
how
i
lost
belief
i
had
a
little
brother
whom
i
loved
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
indeed
after
my
mother
died
he
was
the
only
thing
i
really
had
to
love
for
i
think
that
my
father
cares
more
for
elizabeth
than
he
does
for
me
she
is
so
much
the
better
at
business
matters
and
elizabeth
and
i
never
quite
got
on
i
daresay
that
the
fault
is
mine
but
the
fact
remains
we
are
sisters
but
we
are
not
intimate
well
my
brother
fell
ill
of
a
fever
and
for
a
long
time
he
lay
between
life
and
death
and
i
prayed
for
him
as
i
never
prayed
for
anybody
or
anything
before
yes
i
prayed
that
i
might
die
instead
of
him
then
he
passed
through
the
crisis
and
got
better
and
i
thanked
god
thinking
that
my
prayers
had
been
answered
oh
how
happy
i
was
for
those
ten
days
and
then
this
happened
my
brother
got
a
chill
a
relapse
followed
and
in
three
days
he
was
dead
the
last
words
that
he
spoke
to
me
were
oh
do
nt
let
me
die
bee
he
used
to
call
me
bee
please
do
nt
let
me
die
dear
bee
but
he
died
died
in
my
arms
and
when
it
was
over
i
rose
from
his
side
feeling
as
though
my
heart
was
dead
also
i
prayed
no
more
after
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
my
prayers
had
been
mocked
at
as
though
he
had
been
given
back
to
me
for
a
little
while
in
order
that
the
blow
might
be
more
crushing
when
it
fell
do
nt
you
think
that
you
were
a
little
foolish
in
taking
such
a
view
said
geoffrey
have
you
not
been
amused
sometimes
to
read
about
the
early
christians
how
the
lead
would
not
boil
the
martyr
or
the
lion
would
not
eat
him
or
the
rain
from
a
blue
sky
put
out
the
fire
and
how
the
pagan
king
at
once
was
converted
and
accepted
a
great
many
difficult
doctrines
without
further
delay
the
athanasian
creed
was
not
necessarily
true
because
the
fire
would
not
light
or
the
sword
would
not
cut
nor
excuse
me
were
all
your
old
beliefs
wrong
because
your
prayer
was
unanswered
it
is
an
ancient
story
that
we
cannot
tell
whether
the
answering
of
our
petitions
will
be
good
or
ill
for
us
of
course
i
do
not
know
anything
about
such
things
but
it
seems
to
me
rash
to
suppose
that
providence
is
going
to
alter
the
working
of
its
eternal
laws
merely
to
suit
the
passing
wishes
of
individuals
wishes
too
that
in
many
cases
would
bring
unforeseen
sorrows
if
fulfilled
besides
i
daresay
that
the
poor
child
is
happier
dead
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
lived
it
is
not
an
altogether
pleasant
world
for
most
of
us
yes
mr
bingham
i
know
and
i
daresay
that
i
should
have
got
over
the
shock
in
time
only
after
that
i
began
to
read
i
read
the
histories
of
the
religions
and
compared
them
and
i
read
the
works
of
those
writers
who
have
risen
up
to
attack
them
i
found
or
i
thought
that
i
found
the
same
springs
of
superstition
in
them
all
superstitions
arising
from
elementary
natural
causes
and
handed
on
with
variations
from
race
to
race
and
time
to
time
in
some
i
found
the
same
story
only
with
a
slightly
altered
face
and
i
learned
moreover
that
each
faith
denied
the
other
and
claimed
truth
for
itself
alone
after
that
new
lights
upon
it
poetry
and
romance
however
had
always
the
greatest
attractions
for
me
how
i
have
wept
over
the
pathos
of
my
heroines
and
laughed
at
the
comicalities
of
my
buffoons
alas
i
could
find
no
one
to
join
me
in
my
appreciation
and
solitary
admiration
for
one
s
self
however
genuine
becomes
satiating
after
a
time
my
father
remonstrated
with
me
too
on
the
score
of
expense
and
loss
of
time
so
that
i
was
finally
compelled
to
relinquish
my
dreams
of
literary
independence
and
to
become
a
clerk
in
a
wholesale
mercantile
firm
connected
with
the
west
african
trade
even
when
condemned
to
the
prosaic
duties
which
fell
to
my
lot
in
the
office
i
continued
faithful
to
my
first
love
i
have
introduced
pieces
of
word
painting
into
the
most
commonplace
business
letters
which
have
i
am
told
considerably
astonished
the
recipients
my
refined
sarcasm
has
made
defaulting
creditors
writhe
and
wince
occasionally
like
the
great
silas
wegg
i
would
drop
into
poetry
and
so
raise
the
whole
tone
of
the
correspondence
thus
what
could
be
more
elegant
than
my
rendering
of
the
firm
s
instructions
to
the
captain
of
one
of
their
vessels
it
ran
in
this
way
from
england
captain
you
must
steer
a
course
directly
to
madeira
land
the
casks
of
salted
beef
then
away
to
teneriffe
pray
be
careful
cool
and
wary
with
the
merchants
of
canary
when
you
leave
them
make
the
most
of
the
trade
winds
to
the
coast
down
it
you
shall
sail
as
far
as
the
land
of
calabar
and
from
there
you
ll
onward
go
to
bonny
and
fernando
po
and
so
on
for
four
pages
the
captain
instead
of
treasuring
up
this
little
gem
called
at
the
office
next
day
and
demanded
with
quite
unnecessary
warmth
what
the
thing
meant
and
i
was
compelled
to
translate
it
all
back
into
prose
on
this
as
on
other
similar
occasions
my
employer
took
me
severely
to
task
for
he
was
you
see
a
man
entirely
devoid
of
all
pretensions
to
literary
taste
all
this
however
is
a
mere
preamble
and
leads
up
to
the
fact
that
after
ten
years
or
so
of
drudgery
i
inherited
a
legacy
which
though
small
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
my
simple
wants
finding
myself
independent
i
rented
a
quiet
house
removed
from
the
uproar
and
bustle
of
london
and
there
i
settled
down
with
the
intention
of
producing
some
great
work
which
should
single
me
out
from
the
family
of
the
smiths
and
render
my
name
immortal
to
this
end
i
laid
in
several
quires
of
foolscap
a
box
of
quill
pens
and
a
sixpenny
bottle
of
ink
and
having
given
my
housekeeper
injunctions
to
deny
me
to
all
visitors
i
proceeded
to
look
round
for
a
suitable
subject
i
was
looking
round
for
some
weeks
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
found
that
i
had
by
constant
nibbling
devoured
a
large
number
of
the
quills
and
had
spread
the
ink
out
to
such
advantage
what
with
blots
spills
and
abortive
commencements
that
there
appeared
to
be
some
everywhere
except
in
the
bottle
as
to
the
story
itself
however
the
facility
of
my
youth
had
deserted
me
completely
and
my
mind
remained
a
complete
blank
nor
could
i
do
what
i
would
excite
my
sterile
imagination
to
conjure
up
a
single
incident
or
character
in
this
strait
i
determined
to
devote
my
leisure
to
running
rapidly
through
the
works
of
the
leading
english
novelists
from
daniel
defoe
to
the
present
day
in
the
hope
of
stimulating
my
latent
ideas
and
of
getting
a
good
grasp
of
the
general
tendency
of
literature
for
some
time
past
i
had
avoided
opening
any
work
of
fiction
because
one
of
the
greatest
faults
of
my
youth
had
been
that
i
invariably
and
unconsciously
mimicked
the
style
of
the
last
author
whom
i
had
happened
to
read
now
however
i
made
up
my
mind
to
seek
safety
in
a
multitude
and
by
consulting
all
the
english
classics
to
avoid
the
danger
of
imitating
any
one
too
closely
i
had
just
accomplished
the
task
of
reading
through
the
majority
of
the
standard
novels
at
the
time
when
my
narrative
commences
it
was
then
about
twenty
minutes
to
ten
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
of
june
eighteen
hundred
and
eighty
six
that
after
disposing
of
a
pint
of
beer
and
a
welsh
rarebit
for
my
supper
i
seated
myself
in
my
arm
chair
cocked
my
feet
upon
a
stool
and
lit
my
pipe
as
was
my
custom
both
my
pulse
and
my
temperature
were
as
far
as
i
know
normal
at
the
time
i
would
give
the
state
of
the
barometer
but
that
unlucky
instrument
had
experienced
an
unprecedented
fall
of
forty
two
inches
from
a
nail
to
the
ground
and
was
not
in
a
reliable
condition
we
live
in
a
scientific
age
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
move
with
the
times
whilst
in
that
comfortable
lethargic
condition
which
accompanies
both
digestion
and
poisoning
by
nicotine
i
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
extraordinary
fact
that
my
little
drawing
room
had
elongated
into
a
great
salon
and
that
my
humble
table
had
increased
in
proportion
round
this
colossal
mahogany
were
seated
a
great
number
of
people
who
were
talking
earnestly
together
and
the
surface
in
front
of
them
was
strewn
with
books
and
pamphlets
i
could
not
help
observing
that
these
persons
were
dressed
in
a
most
extraordinary
mixture
of
costumes
for
those
at
the
end
nearest
to
me
wore
peruke
wigs
swords
and
all
the
fashions
of
two
centuries
back
those
about
the
centre
had
tight
knee
breeches
high
cravats
and
heavy
bunches
of
seals
while
among
those
at
the
far
side
the
majority
were
dressed
in
the
most
modern
style
and
among
them
i
saw
to
my
surprise
several
eminent
men
of
letters
whom
i
had
the
honour
of
knowing
there
were
two
or
three
women
in
the
company
i
should
have
risen
to
my
miriam
herself
that
an
unexpected
intimacy
was
coming
about
between
miriam
and
mallard
for
in
her
frequent
thoughts
of
mallard
she
had
necessarily
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
perceive
the
true
issue
of
her
self
will
and
so
far
from
desiring
to
blind
him
she
had
almost
a
hope
that
one
day
he
might
know
how
her
life
had
shaped
itself
mallard
s
position
in
her
mind
was
a
singular
one
in
some
such
way
she
might
have
regarded
a
brother
who
had
always
lived
remote
from
her
but
whom
she
had
every
reason
to
love
and
reverence
her
esteem
for
him
was
boundless
he
was
the
ideal
of
the
artist
and
at
the
same
time
of
the
nobly
strong
man
had
such
a
thing
been
possible
she
would
have
sought
to
make
him
her
confidant
however
it
was
to
be
explained
she
felt
no
wound
to
her
self
respect
in
supposing
him
cognizant
of
all
her
sufferings
rather
a
solace
a
source
of
strength
was
it
in
a
measure
woman
s
gratitude
for
love
in
the
course
of
three
years
she
had
seen
many
reasons
for
believing
that
reuben
was
right
that
the
artist
had
loved
her
and
gone
through
dark
struggles
when
her
fate
was
being
decided
that
must
have
added
tenderness
to
her
former
regard
and
admiration
but
she
was
glad
that
he
had
now
recovered
his
liberty
the
first
meeting
his
look
and
the
grasp
of
his
hand
told
her
at
once
that
the
trouble
was
long
gone
by
she
was
glad
of
this
and
the
proof
of
her
sincerity
came
when
she
watched
the
relations
between
him
and
miriam
on
the
last
evening
miriam
came
to
her
room
carrying
a
small
portfolio
which
she
opened
before
her
disclosing
three
water
colours
you
have
bought
them
cecily
asked
as
the
other
said
nothing
no
mr
mallard
has
given
me
them
was
the
answer
in
a
voice
which
affected
a
careless
pleasure
they
are
admirable
i
am
delighted
that
you
take
such
a
present
away
with
you
cecily
expected
no
confidences
and
received
none
she
could
only
puzzle
over
the
problem
why
did
miriam
behave
with
so
strange
a
coldness
her
new
way
of
regarding
life
ought
to
have
resulted
in
her
laying
aside
that
austerity
mrs
lessingham
hinted
an
opinion
that
the
change
did
not
go
very
deep
puritanism
the
result
of
birth
and
breeding
was
not
so
easily
eradicated
mallard
stayed
on
in
rome
but
during
this
next
week
cecily
only
saw
him
twice
the
first
time
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
pincio
then
in
the
forum
on
that
second
occasion
he
was
invited
to
dine
with
them
at
the
hotel
the
next
day
mr
seaborne
s
company
having
also
been
requested
the
result
was
a
delightful
evening
seaborne
was
just
now
busy
with
a
certain
period
of
papal
history
he
talked
of
some
old
books
he
had
been
reading
in
the
vatican
library
and
revealed
a
world
utterly
strange
to
all
his
hearers
here
were
men
who
used
their
lives
to
some
purpose
who
rot
only
planned
but
executed
when
the
excitement
of
the
evening
had
subsided
cecily
thought
with
more
bitterness
than
ever
yet
of
the
contrast
between
such
workers
and
her
husband
the
feeling
which
had
first
come
upon
her
intensely
when
she
stood
before
mallard
s
picture
at
the
academy
was
now
growing
her
habitual
mood
she
had
shut
herself
out
for
ever
from
close
communion
with
this
world
of
genuine
activity
she
could
only
regard
it
from
behind
a
barrier
instead
of
warming
her
heart
and
brain
in
free
enjoyment
of
its
emotions
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
these
glimpses
harmed
her
injured
her
morally
one
cannot
dwell
with
discontent
and
keep
a
healthy
imagination
she
knew
her
danger
and
it
increased
the
misery
with
which
she
looked
forward
another
week
and
again
there
was
a
chance
meeting
with
mallard
this
time
on
the
via
appia
where
cecily
and
her
aunt
were
driving
they
spent
a
couple
of
hours
together
at
the
parting
mallard
announced
that
the
next
day
would
see
him
on
his
journey
to
london
chapter
x
elgar
at
work
at
dover
it
was
cold
and
foggy
the
shore
looked
mildewed
the
town
rain
soaked
and
mud
stained
in
london
a
solid
leaden
sky
lowered
above
the
streets
neither
threatening
rain
nor
allowing
a
hope
of
sunlight
what
a
labour
breathing
had
become
my
heart
warms
to
my
native
land
said
spence
this
is
a
spring
day
that
recalls
one
s
youth
eleanor
tried
to
smile
but
the
railway
journey
had
depressed
her
beneath
the
possibility
of
joking
miriam
was
pallid
and
miserable
she
had
scarcely
spoken
since
she
set
foot
on
the
steamboat
cab
borne
through
the
clangorous
streets
they
seemed
a
party
of
exiles
the
house
in
chelsea
which
the
spences
held
on
a
long
lease
had
been
occupied
during
their
absence
by
edward
s
brother
in
law
and
his
family
vacated
swept
and
garnished
the
old
furniture
from
the
pantechnicon
re
established
somewhat
at
haphazard
it
was
not
a
home
that
welcomed
warmly
but
one
could
heap
coals
on
all
the
fires
and
draw
down
the
blinds
as
soon
as
possible
and
make
a
sort
of
christmas
evening
if
only
one
s
lungs
could
have
free
play
but
in
a
week
or
so
such
little
incommodities
would
become
natural
again
miriam
had
decided
that
in
a
day
or
two
she
would
go
down
to
bartles
not
to
stay
there
but
merely
to
see
her
relative
mrs
fletcher
and
redbeck
house
before
leaving
london
she
must
visit
reuben
she
had
promised
cecily
to
do
so
without
delay
this
same
evening
she
posted
a
card
to
her
brother
asking
him
to
be
at
home
to
see
her
early
the
next
morning
she
reached
belsize
park
at
ten
o
clock
and
dismissed
the
cab
as
soon
as
she
had
alighted
from
it
her
ring
at
the
door
was
long
in
being
answered
and
and
of
dover
lay
far
on
the
horizon
on
the
other
side
a
dim
haze
upon
the
blue
water
marked
the
position
of
the
french
coast
it
was
nearly
five
and
the
sun
was
beginning
to
sink
down
again
in
the
west
when
the
fisherman
after
gazing
steadily
ahead
for
some
time
with
his
horny
hand
shading
his
eyes
touched
ezra
on
the
sleeve
see
them
breakers
over
there
he
said
pointing
over
the
starboard
bow
far
away
ezra
could
see
a
long
roll
of
foam
breaking
the
monotony
of
the
broad
stretch
of
ocean
them
s
the
goodwins
he
went
on
and
them
craft
ahead
is
at
anchor
in
the
downs
the
vessels
in
question
were
miles
away
but
ezra
brightened
up
at
the
sight
of
their
destination
and
he
once
again
arranged
his
toilet
and
that
of
his
father
thank
goodness
he
muttered
with
a
long
sigh
of
relief
as
he
peered
at
the
ships
which
were
growing
clearer
and
larger
every
moment
that
outer
one
is
the
black
eagle
or
i
am
much
mistaken
he
s
not
gone
yet
that
is
the
black
eagle
his
father
said
with
confidence
i
know
her
by
the
cut
of
her
stern
and
the
rake
of
her
masts
as
they
came
nearer
still
any
lingering
doubt
was
finally
dispelled
there
s
the
white
paint
line
said
ezra
it
s
certainly
her
take
us
alongside
that
ship
which
is
lying
to
the
outside
there
sampson
the
fisherman
looked
ahead
once
more
to
the
barque
which
has
just
got
her
anchor
up
he
said
why
we
wo
nt
be
in
time
to
catch
her
her
anchor
up
screamed
ezra
you
do
nt
mean
to
tell
me
she
s
off
look
at
that
the
man
answered
as
he
spoke
they
saw
first
one
great
square
of
canvas
appear
above
the
vessel
and
then
another
until
she
had
spread
her
white
wings
to
their
fullest
extent
do
nt
say
we
ca
nt
catch
her
cried
ezra
with
a
furious
oath
i
tell
you
man
that
we
must
catch
her
everything
depends
on
that
she
must
take
three
short
tacks
before
she
s
out
from
the
goodwins
if
we
run
right
on
as
we
are
going
we
may

sake

these
reefs

with
trembling
fingers
ezra
let
out
the
sail
and
the
boat
lay
over
further
under
the
increased
pressure
is
there
no
other
sail
that
we
could
put
up
if
we
were
running
we
could
rig
up
a
spinnaker
the
fisherman
answered
but
the
wind
has
come
round
three
points
we
can
do
no
more
i
think
we
are
catching
her
john
girdlestone
cried
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
barque
which
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
ahead
yes
we
are
now
but
she
hai
nt
got
her
way
on
yet
she
ll
draw
ahead
presently
wo
nt
she
jarge
the
fisherman
s
son
nodded
and
burst
into
hoarse
merriment
it
s
better
n
a
race
he
cried
with
our
necks
for
a
prize
ezra
muttered
to
himself
it
s
a
little
too
exciting
to
be
pleasant
we
are
still
gaining
they
had
a
clear
view
of
the
dark
hull
and
towering
canvas
of
the
barque
as
she
swept
along
in
front
of
them
intending
evidently
to
take
advantage
of
the
wind
in
order
to
get
outside
the
goodwins
before
beating
up
channel
she
s
going
about
sampson
remarked
as
he
spoke
the
snow
white
pile
lay
over
in
the
opposite
direction
and
the
whole
broadside
of
the
vessel
became
visible
to
them
every
sail
standing
out
as
though
carved
from
ivory
against
the
cold
blue
sky
if
we
do
nt
catch
her
on
this
tack
we
wo
nt
get
her
at
all
the
fisherman
observed
when
they
put
about
next
they
ll
reach
right
out
into
the
channel
where
s
something
white
said
ezra
excitedly
he
dived
into
the
cabin
and
reappeared
with
a
dirty
table
cloth
stand
up
here
father
now
keep
on
waving
it
they
may
see
you
i
think
as
we
are
overhaulin
of
them
remarked
the
boy
we
re
doing
that
his
father
answered
the
question
is
will
we
get
near
enough
to
stop
em
afore
they
gets
off
on
the
next
tack
the
old
merchant
was
standing
in
the
bows
waving
the
signal
in
the
air
his
son
sprang
up
beside
him
and
flourished
his
handkerchief
they
do
nt
look
more
than
half
a
mile
off
let
us
shout
together
the
two
blended
their
voices
in
a
hoarse
roar
which
was
taken
up
by
the
boatman
and
his
son
once
again
cried
ezra
and
again
their
shout
resounded
over
the
sea
a
long
drawn
cry
it
was
with
a
ring
of
despair
and
of
sorrow
still
the
barque
kept
steadily
on
her
way
if
they
do
nt
go
about
we
shall
catch
them
the
fisherman
said
if
they
keep
on
another
five
minutes
we
are
right
do
you
hear
that
ezra
cried
to
his
father
and
they
both
shouted
with
new
energy
and
waved
their
signals
they
re
goin
about
george
burst
in
it
s
all
up
girdlestone
groaned
as
he
saw
the
mainyard
swing
back
they
all
strained
their
eyes
waiting
for
the
other
to
follow
it
remained
stationary
they
have
seen
us
cried
the
fisherman
they
are
waitin
to
pick
us
up
then
we
are
saved
said
ezra
stepping
down
and
wiping
the
perspiration
which
poured
from
his
forehead
go
down
into
the
cabin
father
and
put
yourself
straight
you
look
like
a
ghost
captain
hamilton
miggs
had
found
the
liquor
of
the
cock
and
cowslip
so
very
much
to
his
taste
in
spite
of
its
vitriolic
peculiarities
recorded
in
a
preceding
chapter
that
he
rejoined
his
ship
in
a
very
shaky
and
demoralized
condition
he
was
a
devout
believer
in
the
homoeopathic
revelation
that
like
may
be
cured
by
like
so
he
forthwith
proceeded
to
set
for
it
we
ranged
ourselves
with
them
and
unchecked
as
unbidden
sprang
on
three
of
the
led
horses
all
this
passed
more
quickly
than
i
can
relate
it
so
that
before
our
feet
were
well
in
the
stirrups
a
partial
silence
then
a
mightier
roar
of
anger
at
once
proclaimed
and
hailed
the
re
appearance
of
the
vidame
bigoted
beyond
belief
were
the
mob
of
paris
of
that
day
cruel
vengeful
and
always
athirst
for
blood
and
this
man
had
killed
not
only
their
leader
but
a
priest
he
had
committed
sacrilege
what
would
they
do
i
could
just
by
stooping
forward
command
a
side
view
of
the
gallery
and
the
scene
passing
there
was
such
that
i
forgot
in
it
our
own
peril
for
surely
in
all
his
reckless
life
bezers
had
never
been
so
emphatically
the
man
for
the
situation
had
never
shown
to
such
advantage
as
at
this
moment
when
he
stood
confronting
the
sea
of
faces
the
sneer
on
his
lip
a
smile
in
his
eyes
and
looked
down
unblenching
a
figure
of
scorn
on
the
men
who
were
literally
agape
for
his
life
the
calm
defiance
of
his
steadfast
look
fascinated
even
me
wonder
and
admiration
for
the
time
took
the
place
of
dislike
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
there
was
not
some
atom
of
good
in
this
man
so
fearless
and
no
face
but
one
no
face
i
think
in
the
world
but
one
could
have
drawn
my
eyes
from
him
but
that
one
face
was
beside
him
i
clutched
marie
s
arm
and
pointed
to
the
bareheaded
figure
at
bezers
right
hand
it
was
louis
himself
our
louis
de
pavannes
but
he
was
changed
indeed
from
the
gay
cavalier
i
remembered
and
whom
i
had
last
seen
riding
down
the
street
at
caylus
smiling
back
at
us
and
waving
his
adieux
to
his
mistress
beside
the
vidame
he
had
the
air
of
being
slight
even
short
the
face
which
i
had
known
so
bright
and
winning
was
now
white
and
set
his
fair
curling
hair
scarce
darker
than
croisette
s
hung
dank
bedabbled
with
blood
which
flowed
from
a
wound
in
his
head
his
sword
was
gone
his
dress
was
torn
and
disordered
and
covered
with
dust
his
lips
moved
but
he
held
up
his
head
he
bore
himself
bravely
with
it
all
so
bravely
that
i
choked
and
my
heart
seemed
bursting
as
i
looked
at
him
standing
there
forlorn
and
now
unarmed
i
knew
that
kit
seeing
him
thus
would
gladly
have
died
with
him
and
i
thanked
god
she
did
not
see
him
yet
there
was
a
quietness
in
his
fortitude
which
made
a
great
difference
between
his
air
and
that
of
bezers
he
lacked
as
became
one
looking
unarmed
on
certain
death
the
sneer
and
smile
of
the
giant
beside
him
what
was
the
vidame
about
to
do
i
shuddered
as
i
asked
myself
not
surrender
him
not
fling
him
bodily
to
the
people
no
not
that
i
felt
sure
he
would
let
no
others
share
his
vengeance
that
his
pride
would
not
suffer
that
and
even
while
i
wondered
the
doubt
was
solved
i
saw
bezers
raise
his
hand
in
a
peculiar
fashion
simultaneously
a
cry
rang
sharply
out
above
the
tumult
and
down
in
headlong
charge
towards
the
farther
steps
came
the
band
of
horsemen
who
had
got
clear
of
the
crowd
on
that
side
they
were
but
ten
or
twelve
but
under
his
eye
they
charged
as
if
they
had
been
a
thousand
the
rabble
shrank
from
the
collision
and
fled
aside
quick
as
thought
the
riders
swerved
and
changing
their
course
galloped
through
the
looser
part
of
the
throng
and
in
a
trice
drew
rein
side
by
side
with
us
a
laugh
and
a
jeer
on
their
reckless
lips
it
was
neatly
done
and
while
it
was
being
done
the
vidame
and
his
knot
of
men
with
those
who
had
been
searching
the
building
hurried
down
the
gallery
towards
us
their
rear
cleared
for
the
moment
by
the
troopers
feint
the
dismounted
men
came
bundling
down
the
steps
their
eyes
aglow
with
the
war
fire
and
got
horses
as
they
could
among
them
i
lost
sight
of
louis
but
perceived
him
presently
pale
and
bewildered
mounted
behind
a
trooper
a
man
sprang
up
before
each
of
us
too
greeting
our
appearance
merely
by
a
grunt
of
surprise
for
it
was
no
time
to
ask
or
answer
the
mob
was
recovering
itself
and
each
moment
brought
it
reinforcements
while
its
fury
was
augmented
by
the
trick
we
had
played
it
and
the
prospect
of
our
escape
we
were
under
forty
all
told
and
some
men
were
riding
double
bezers
eye
glanced
hastily
over
his
array
and
lit
on
us
three
he
turned
and
gave
some
order
to
his
lieutenant
the
fellow
spurred
his
horse
a
splendid
grey
as
powerful
as
his
master
s
alongside
of
croisette
threw
his
arm
round
the
lad
and
dragged
him
dexterously
on
to
his
own
crupper
i
did
not
understand
the
action
but
i
saw
croisette
settle
himself
behind
blaise
bure
for
he
it
was
and
supposed
no
harm
was
intended
the
next
moment
we
had
surged
forward
and
were
swaying
to
and
fro
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
what
ensued
i
cannot
tell
the
outlook
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
was
limited
to
wildly
plunging
horses
we
were
in
the
centre
of
the
band
and
riders
swaying
in
the
saddle
with
a
glimpse
here
and
there
of
a
fringe
of
white
scowling
faces
and
tossing
arms
once
a
lane
opening
i
saw
the
vidame
s
charger
he
was
in
the
van
stumble
and
fall
among
the
crowd
and
heard
a
great
shout
go
up
but
bezers
by
a
mighty
effort
lifted
it
to
its
legs
again
and
once
too
a
minute
later
those
riding
on
my
right
swerved
outwards
and
i
saw
something
i
never
afterwards
forgot
it
was
the
body
of
the
coadjutor
lying
face
upwards
the
table
quite
erect
and
holding
on
by
her
fierce
young
claws
she
stopped
to
mew
with
pathos
at
each
elbow
or
darted
off
to
the
open
door
when
a
song
sparrow
forgot
himself
and
lit
in
the
grass
too
near
william
did
not
talk
much
but
his
sister
todd
occupied
the
time
and
told
all
the
news
there
was
to
tell
of
dunnet
landing
and
its
coasts
while
the
old
mother
listened
with
delight
her
hospitality
was
something
exquisite
she
had
the
gift
which
so
many
women
lack
of
being
able
to
make
themselves
and
their
houses
belong
entirely
to
a
guest
s
pleasure
that
charming
surrender
for
the
moment
of
themselves
and
whatever
belongs
to
them
so
that
they
make
a
part
of
one
s
own
life
that
can
never
be
forgotten
tact
is
after
all
a
kind
of
mindreading
and
my
hostess
held
the
golden
gift
sympathy
is
of
the
mind
as
well
as
the
heart
and
mrs
blackett
s
world
and
mine
were
one
from
the
moment
we
met
besides
she
had
that
final
that
highest
gift
of
heaven
a
perfect
self
forgetfulness
sometimes
as
i
watched
her
eager
sweet
old
face
i
wondered
why
she
had
been
set
to
shine
on
this
lonely
island
of
the
northern
coast
it
must
have
been
to
keep
the
balance
true
and
make
up
to
all
her
scattered
and
depending
neighbors
for
other
things
which
they
may
have
lacked
when
we
had
finished
clearing
away
the
old
blue
plates
and
the
kitten
had
taken
care
of
her
share
of
the
fresh
haddock
just
as
we
were
putting
back
the
kitchen
chairs
in
their
places
mrs
todd
said
briskly
that
she
must
go
up
into
the
pasture
now
to
gather
the
desired
herbs
you
can
stop
here
an
rest
or
you
can
accompany
me
she
announced
mother
ought
to
have
her
nap
and
when
we
come
back
she
an
william
ll
sing
for
you
she
admires
music
said
mrs
todd
turning
to
speak
to
her
mother
but
mrs
blackett
tried
to
say
that
she
could
nt
sing
as
she
used
and
perhaps
william
would
nt
feel
like
it
she
looked
tired
the
good
old
soul
or
i
should
have
liked
to
sit
in
the
peaceful
little
house
while
she
slept
i
had
had
much
pleasant
experience
of
pastures
already
in
her
daughter
s
company
but
it
seemed
best
to
go
with
mrs
todd
and
off
we
went
mrs
todd
carried
the
gingham
bag
which
she
had
brought
from
home
and
a
small
heavy
burden
in
the
bottom
made
it
hang
straight
and
slender
from
her
hand
the
way
was
steep
and
she
soon
grew
breathless
so
that
we
sat
down
to
rest
awhile
on
a
convenient
large
stone
among
the
bayberry
there
i
wanted
you
to
see
this
tis
mother
s
picture
said
mrs
todd
twas
taken
once
when
she
was
up
to
portland
soon
after
she
was
married
that
s
me
she
added
opening
another
worn
case
and
displaying
the
full
face
of
the
cheerful
child
she
looked
like
still
in
spite
of
being
past
sixty
and
here
s
william
an
father
together
i
take
after
father
large
and
heavy
an
william
is
like
mother
s
folks
short
an
thin
he
ought
to
have
made
something
o
himself
bein
a
man
an
so
like
mother
but
though
he
s
been
very
steady
to
work
an
kept
up
the
farm
an
done
his
fishin
too
right
along
he
never
had
mother
s
snap
an
power
o
seein
things
just
as
they
be
he
s
got
excellent
judgment
too
meditated
william
s
sister
but
she
could
not
arrive
at
any
satisfactory
decision
upon
what
she
evidently
thought
his
failure
in
life
i
think
it
is
well
to
see
any
one
so
happy
an
makin
the
most
of
life
just
as
it
falls
to
hand
she
said
as
she
began
to
put
the
daguerreotypes
away
again
but
i
reached
out
my
hand
to
see
her
mother
s
once
more
a
most
flowerlike
face
of
a
lovely
young
woman
in
quaint
dress
there
was
in
the
eyes
a
look
of
anticipation
and
joy
a
far
off
look
that
sought
the
horizon
one
often
sees
it
in
seafaring
families
inherited
by
girls
and
boys
alike
from
men
who
spend
their
lives
at
sea
and
are
always
watching
for
distant
sails
or
the
first
loom
of
the
land
at
sea
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
close
by
and
this
has
its
counterpart
in
a
sailor
s
character
in
the
large
and
brave
and
patient
traits
that
are
developed
the
hopeful
pleasantness
that
one
loves
so
in
a
seafarer
when
the
family
pictures
were
wrapped
again
in
a
big
handkerchief
we
set
forward
in
a
narrow
footpath
and
made
our
way
to
a
lonely
place
that
faced
northward
where
there
was
more
pasturage
and
fewer
bushes
and
we
went
down
to
the
edge
of
short
grass
above
some
rocky
cliffs
where
the
deep
sea
broke
with
a
great
noise
though
the
wind
was
down
and
the
water
looked
quiet
a
little
way
from
shore
among
the
grass
grew
such
pennyroyal
as
the
rest
of
the
world
could
not
provide
there
was
a
fine
fragrance
in
the
air
as
we
gathered
it
sprig
by
sprig
and
stepped
along
carefully
and
mrs
todd
pressed
her
aromatic
nosegay
between
her
hands
and
offered
it
to
me
again
and
again
there
s
nothin
like
it
she
said
oh
no
there
s
no
such
pennyr
yal
as
this
in
the
state
of
maine
it
s
the
right
pattern
of
the
plant
and
all
the
rest
i
ever
see
is
but
an
imitation
do
nt
it
do
you
good
and
i
answered
with
enthusiasm
there
dear
i
never
showed
nobody
else
but
mother
where
to
find
this
place
tis
kind
of
sainted
to
me
nathan
my
husband
an
i
used
to
love
this
place
when
we
was
courtin
and
she
hesitated
and
then
spoke
softly
when
he
was
lost
twas
just
off
times
welcome
to
our
home
dear
aunt

you
will
let
me
call
you

humble
home

your
presence
beneath
this
roof
would
amply
compensate
me
i
would
take
a
world
of
pleasure
in
working
a
little
harder
than
i
do
now
to
keep
you
here
before
you
give
me
too
much
hope
on
that
point
you
had
better
talk
it
over
with
your
father
he
may
think
differently
from
what
you
do
he
may
not
want
to
keep
a
tramp
s
boarding
house
she
added
quietly
father
will
be
sure
to
think
as
i
do
reiterated
bernardine
he
has
a
rough
exterior
but
the
kindest
of
hearts
beats
in
his
rugged
bosom
you
are
right
there
bernardine
said
david
moore
pushing
open
an
inner
door
and
coming
forward
i
could
not
help
overhearing
all
that
passed
between
you
two
i
am
sorry
you
have
lost
all
your
money
miss
rogers
but
that
will
not
make
any
difference
in
the
heartiness
of
the
welcome
we
give
you
and
if
bernardine
wants
you
to
stay
here
with
us
stay
you
shall
so
take
off
your
bonnet
and
make
yourself
at
home
chapter

true
love
never
does
run
smooth
miss
rogers
was
quite
overcome
by
the
hearty
welcome
she
received
from
david
moore
the
old
basket
maker
and
bernardine
his
lovely
daughter
it
went
straight
to
her
lonely
heart
because
she
knew
it
was
genuine
friendship
untainted
by
mercenary
motives
she
shared
bernardine
s
humble
yet
dainty
apartment
and
fell
quite
naturally
into
being
a
member
of
the
household
there
was
one
thing
which
puzzled
her
greatly
and
that
was
the
sighs
that
would
rend
sweet
bernardine
s
breast
while
she
was
sleeping
the
girl
has
some
secret
sorrow
which
she
is
hiding
from
the
world
she
thought
anxiously
i
must
find
out
what
it
is
she
had
been
an
inmate
of
bernardine
s
home
for
a
week
before
she
learned
that
the
girl
was
soon
to
be
wedded
bernardine
s
father
told
her
hinting
triumphantly
that
that
event
would
mean
the
dawn
of
a
more
prosperous
future
for
the
family
as
her
intended
husband
was
very
rich
had
money
to
burn
do
nt
say
much
about
him
to
bernardine
he
added
quickly
for
she
s
not
in
love
with
him
by
any
means
then
why
is
she
going
to
marry
him
asked
miss
rogers
amazedly
he
has
money
replied
david
moore
nodding
his
head
wisely
and
that
s
what
sharp
girls
are
looking
for
nowadays
i
thought
love
was
the
ruling
power
which
moved
young
girls
hearts
responded
miss
rogers
slowly
at
least
it
used
to
be
when
i
was
a
young
girl
like
bernardine
he
laughed
uneasily
but
made
no
reply
as
bernardine
entered
the
room
at
that
instant
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
jasper
wilde
has
returned
to
the
city
father
she
said
tremulously
and
and
he
is
coming
here
this
evening
to
see
us
as
the
girl
uttered
the
words
miss
rogers
was
quite
sure
she
could
detect
the
sound
of
tears
in
her
quivering
voice
i
am
very
glad
replied
david
moore
endeavoring
to
speak
lightly
i
shall
be
mighty
pleased
to
see
my
prospective
son
in
law
bernardine
drew
back
quickly
her
lovely
face
pitifully
pale
then
turned
abruptly
and
hurried
from
the
room
miss
rogers
followed
her
the
girl
went
to
her
own
apartment
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
burying
her
face
in
the
counterpane
wept
such
bitter
passionate
tears
that
miss
rogers
was
alarmed
for
her
you
poor
child
exclaimed
miss
rogers
sit
down
here
beside
me
and
tell
me
the
whole
story
let
me
understand
it
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
i
met
one
whom
i
could
love
and
we
parted
i
sent
him
away
because
my
father
had
declared
that
i
should
marry
this
other
one
because
of
his
wealth
said
miss
rogers
in
a
strangely
hard
voice
no
no
do
not
do
my
father
that
injustice
it
was
not
because
of
his
wealth
i
i
should
have
had
to
marry
him
had
he
been
the
poorest
man
in
the
city
it
is
cruel
it
is
outrageous
to
ask
a
young
girl
to
marry
a
man
whom
she
detests
it
is
barbarous
in
my
opinion
that
is
carrying
parental
authority
too
far
this
marriage
must
not
take
place
bernardine
it
would
be
wicked
a
sin
against
god
although
miss
rogers
did
her
best
to
probe
into
the
mystery
for
bernardine
s
sake
the
girl
was
strangely
obdurate
so
she
said
no
more
to
her
on
the
subject
just
then
but
when
she
approached
david
moore
on
this
topic
his
incoherent
replies
puzzled
her
still
more
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
taking
such
an
interest
in
bernardine
s
affairs
but
let
me
warn
you
of
one
thing
miss
rogers
while
you
are
under
my
roof
do
nt
attempt
to
meddle
with
what
does
not
concern
you
in
any
way
by
heeding
my
remark
we
shall
keep
good
friends
this
marriage
must
take
place
the
young
fellow
is
good
enough
and
she
ll
get
to
like
him
after
awhile
see
if
she
does
nt
the
harsh
abrupt
manner
in
which
he
uttered
these
words
told
miss
rogers
that
little
hope
could
be
entertained
from
that
source
bernardine
had
almost
cried
herself
ill
by
the
time
jasper
wilde
s
knock
was
heard
on
the
door
mr
moore
answered
the
summons
is
there
any
use
in
my
coming
in
asked
wilde
grimly
coming
to
a
halt
on
the
threshold
does
your
daughter
consent
to
marry
me
i
could
not
make
head
or
tail
out
of
your
letter
bernardine
s
answer
is
yes
murmured
the
old
man
almost
incoherently
she
consents
for
my
sake
though
heaven
knows
names
of
his
wife
s
callers
reading
some
of
them
aloud
with
comments
as
he
read
the
misses
delasidas
i
worked
a
big
deal
in
futures
for
their
father
this
morning
nice
girls
it
s
time
they
were
getting
married
mrs
belthrop
i
tell
you
what
it
is
edna
you
ca
nt
afford
to
snub
mrs
belthrop
why
belthrop
could
buy
and
sell
us
ten
times
over
his
business
is
worth
a
good
round
sum
to
me
you
d
better
write
her
a
note
mrs
james
highcamp
hugh
the
less
you
have
to
do
with
mrs
highcamp
the
better
madame
laforce
came
all
the
way
from
carrolton
too
poor
old
soul
miss
wiggs
mrs
eleanor
boltons
he
pushed
the
cards
aside
mercy
exclaimed
edna
who
had
been
fuming
why
are
you
taking
the
thing
so
seriously
and
making
such
a
fuss
over
it
i
m
not
making
any
fuss
over
it
but
it
s
just
such
seeming
trifles
that
we
ve
got
to
take
seriously
such
things
count
the
fish
was
scorched
mr
pontellier
would
not
touch
it
edna
said
she
did
not
mind
a
little
scorched
taste
the
roast
was
in
some
way
not
to
his
fancy
and
he
did
not
like
the
manner
in
which
the
vegetables
were
served
it
seems
to
me
he
said
we
spend
money
enough
in
this
house
to
procure
at
least
one
meal
a
day
which
a
man
could
eat
and
retain
his
self
respect
you
used
to
think
the
cook
was
a
treasure
returned
edna
indifferently
perhaps
she
was
when
she
first
came
but
cooks
are
only
human
they
need
looking
after
like
any
other
class
of
persons
that
you
employ
suppose
i
did
nt
look
after
the
clerks
in
my
office
just
let
them
run
things
their
own
way
they
d
soon
make
a
nice
mess
of
me
and
my
business
where
are
you
going
asked
edna
seeing
that
her
husband
arose
from
table
without
having
eaten
a
morsel
except
a
taste
of
the
highly
seasoned
soup
i
m
going
to
get
my
dinner
at
the
club
good
night
he
went
into
the
hall
took
his
hat
and
stick
from
the
stand
and
left
the
house
she
was
somewhat
familiar
with
such
scenes
they
had
often
made
her
very
unhappy
on
a
few
previous
occasions
she
had
been
completely
deprived
of
any
desire
to
finish
her
dinner
sometimes
she
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
to
administer
a
tardy
rebuke
to
the
cook
once
she
went
to
her
room
and
studied
the
cookbook
during
an
entire
evening
finally
writing
out
a
menu
for
the
week
which
left
her
harassed
with
a
feeling
that
after
all
she
had
accomplished
no
good
that
was
worth
the
name
but
that
evening
edna
finished
her
dinner
alone
with
forced
deliberation
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
flamed
with
some
inward
fire
that
lighted
them
after
finishing
her
dinner
she
went
to
her
room
having
instructed
the
boy
to
tell
any
other
callers
that
she
was
indisposed
it
was
a
large
beautiful
room
rich
and
picturesque
in
the
soft
dim
light
which
the
maid
had
turned
low
she
went
and
stood
at
an
open
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
deep
tangle
of
the
garden
below
all
the
mystery
and
witchery
of
the
night
seemed
to
have
gathered
there
amid
the
perfumes
and
the
dusky
and
tortuous
outlines
of
flowers
and
foliage
she
was
seeking
herself
and
finding
herself
in
just
such
sweet
half
darkness
which
met
her
moods
but
the
voices
were
not
soothing
that
came
to
her
from
the
darkness
and
the
sky
above
and
the
stars
they
jeered
and
sounded
mournful
notes
without
promise
devoid
even
of
hope
she
turned
back
into
the
room
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
down
its
whole
length
without
stopping
without
resting
she
carried
in
her
hands
a
thin
handkerchief
which
she
tore
into
ribbons
rolled
into
a
ball
and
flung
from
her
once
she
stopped
and
taking
off
her
wedding
ring
flung
it
upon
the
carpet
when
she
saw
it
lying
there
she
stamped
her
heel
upon
it
striving
to
crush
it
but
her
small
boot
heel
did
not
make
an
indenture
not
a
mark
upon
the
little
glittering
circlet
in
a
sweeping
passion
she
seized
a
glass
vase
from
the
table
and
flung
it
upon
the
tiles
of
the
hearth
she
wanted
to
destroy
something
the
crash
and
clatter
were
what
she
wanted
to
hear
a
maid
alarmed
at
the
din
of
breaking
glass
entered
the
room
to
discover
what
was
the
matter
a
vase
fell
upon
the
hearth
said
edna
never
mind
leave
it
till
morning
oh
you
might
get
some
of
the
glass
in
your
feet
ma
am
insisted
the
young
woman
picking
up
bits
of
the
broken
vase
that
were
scattered
upon
the
carpet
and
here
s
your
ring
ma
am
under
the
chair
edna
held
out
her
hand
and
taking
the
ring
slipped
it
upon
her
finger
xviii
the
following
morning
mr
pontellier
upon
leaving
for
his
office
asked
edna
if
she
would
not
meet
him
in
town
in
order
to
look
at
some
new
fixtures
for
the
library
i
hardly
think
we
need
new
fixtures
leonce
do
nt
let
us
get
anything
new
you
are
too
extravagant
i
do
nt
believe
you
ever
think
of
saving
or
putting
by
the
way
to
become
rich
is
to
make
money
my
dear
edna
not
to
save
it
he
said
he
regretted
that
she
did
not
feel
inclined
to
go
with
him
and
select
new
fixtures
he
kissed
her
good
by
and
told
her
she
was
not
looking
well
and
must
take
care
of
herself
she
was
unusually
pale
and
very
quiet
she
stood
on
the
front
veranda
as
he
quitted
the
house
and
absently
picked
a
few
sprays
of
jessamine
that
grew
upon
a
trellis
near
by
she
inhaled
the
odor
of
the
blossoms
and
thrust
them
into
the
bosom
of
her
white
morning
gown
the
boys
were
dragging
along
the
found
them
his
life
had
shaped
itself
was
no
doubt
to
continue
always
along
these
same
lines
a
woman
had
entered
his
small
world
and
instantly
there
was
discord
the
disturbing
element
had
appeared
wherever
the
woman
had
put
her
foot
a
score
of
distressing
complications
had
sprung
up
like
the
sudden
growth
of
strange
and
puzzling
flowers

marcus
leaning

more
than
mcteague
could

the
situation

beyond

he
spoke
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
his
head
rolled
forward

said
trina
my

mcteague
hopelessly
confounded

cried
marcus
suddenly
enlightened
that
you
are
that
you
too
mcteague
stirred
in
his
chair
looking
at
the
walls
of
the
room
avoiding
the
other
s
glance
he
nodded
his
head
then
suddenly
broke
out
i
ca

help

it
ai
nt
my
fault
is
it
marcus
was
struck
dumb
he
dropped
back
in
his
chair
breathless
suddenly
mcteague
found
his
tongue
i
tell
you
mark
i

i

something
that

just
stronger
than

are
that
s
all
she
came
there
miss
sieppe
came
to
the
parlors
there
three
or
four
times
a
week
and
she
was
the
first
girl
i
had
ever
known
and
you
don
know
why
i
was
so
close
to
her
i
touched
her
face
every
minute
and
her
mouth
and
smelt
her
hair
and
her
breath
oh

everything
i
i
why
mark

everything
i
ca
nt
explain
he
made
a
helpless
movement
with
both
hands
never
had
mcteague
been
so
excited
never
had
he
made
so
long
a
speech
his
arms
moved
in
fierce
uncertain
gestures
his
face
flushed
his
enormous
jaws
shut
together
with
a
sharp
click
at
every
pause
it
was
like
some
colossal
brute
trapped
in
a
delicate
invisible
mesh
raging
exasperated
powerless
to
extricate
himself
marcus
schouler
said
nothing
there
was
a
long
silence
marcus
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
but
seeing
nothing
well
who
would
have
thought
of
this
he
muttered
under
his
breath
here
was
a
fix
marcus
cared
for
trina
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
about
that
he
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
sunday
afternoon
excursions
he
liked
to
be
with
trina
he
too
felt
the
charm
of
the
little
girl
the
charm
of
the
small
pale
forehead
the
little
chin
thrust
out
as
if
in
confidence
and
innocence
the
heavy
odorous
crown
of
black
hair
he
liked
her
immensely
some
day
he
would
speak
he
would
ask
her
to
marry
him
marcus
put
off
this
matter
of
marriage
to
some
future
period
it
would
be
some
time
a
year
perhaps
or
two
the
thing
did
not
take
definite
shape
in
his
mind
marcus
kept
company
with
his
cousin
trina
but
he
knew
plenty
of
other
girls
for
the
matter
of
that
he
liked
all
girls
pretty
well
just
now
the
singleness
and
strength
of
mcteague
s
passion
startled
him
mcteague
would
marry
trina
that
very
afternoon
if
she
would
have
him
but
would
he
marcus
no
he
would
not
if
it
came
to
that
no
he
would
not
yet
he
knew
he
liked
trina
he
could
say
yes
he
could
say
he
loved
her
she
was
his
girl
the
sieppes
acknowledged
him
as
trina
s
young
man
marcus
came
back
to
the
table
and
sat
down
sideways
upon
it
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
mac
he
said
i
don
know
answered
mcteague
in
great
distress
i
don
want
anything
to
to
come
between
us
mark
well
nothun
will
you
bet
vociferated
the
other
no
sir
you
bet
not
mac
marcus
was
thinking
hard
he
could
see
very
clearly
that
mcteague
loved
trina
more
than
he
did
that
in
some
strange
way
this
huge
brutal
fellow
was
capable
of
a
greater
passion
than
himself
who
was
twice
as
clever
suddenly
marcus
jumped
impetuously
to
a
resolution
well
say
mac
he
cried
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
go
ahead
i
guess
you
you
want
her
pretty
bad
i
ll
pull
out
yes
i
will
i
ll
give
her
up
to
you
old
man
the
sense
of
his
own
magnanimity
all
at
once
overcame
marcus
he
saw
himself
as
another
man
very
noble
self
sacrificing
he
stood
apart
and
watched
this
second
self
with
boundless
admiration
and
with
infinite
pity
he
was
so
good
so
magnificent
so
heroic
that
he
almost
sobbed
marcus
made
a
sweeping
gesture
of
resignation
throwing
out
both
his
arms
crying
mac
i
ll
give
her
up
to
you
i
wo
nt
stand
between
you
there
were
actually
tears
again
meanwhile
i
took
charge
of
the
nursing
of
sebastian
fortunately
i
had
brought
with
me
a
good
stock
of
jungle
medicines
in
my
little
travelling
case
including
plenty
of
quinine
and
under
my
careful
treatment
the
professor
passed
the
crisis
and
began
to
mend
slowly
the
first
question
he
asked
me
when
he
felt
himself
able
to
talk
once
more
was
nurse
wade
what
has
become
of
her
for
he
had
not
yet
seen
her
i
feared
the
shock
for
him
she
is
here
with
me
i
answered
in
a
very
measured
voice
she
is
waiting
to
be
allowed
to
come
and
help
me
in
taking
care
of
you
he
shuddered
and
turned
away
his
face
buried
itself
in
the
pillow
i
could
see
some
twinge
of
remorse
had
seized
upon
him
at
last
he
spoke
cumberledge
he
said
in
a
very
low
and
almost
frightened
tone
do
nt
let
her
come
near
me
i
ca
nt
bear
it
i
ca
nt
bear
it
ill
as
he
was
i
did
not
mean
to
let
him
think
i
was
ignorant
of
his
motive
you
ca
nt
bear
a
woman
whose
life
you
have
attempted
i
said
in
my
coldest
and
most
deliberate
way
to
have
a
hand
in
nursing
you
you
ca
nt
bear
to
let
her
heap
coals
of
fire
on
your
head
in
that
you
are
right
but
remember
you
have
attempted
my
life
too
you
have
twice
done
your
best
to
get
me
murdered
he
did
not
pretend
to
deny
it
he
was
too
weak
for
subterfuges
he
only
writhed
as
he
lay
you
are
a
man
he
said
shortly
and
she
is
a
woman
that
is
all
the
difference
then
he
paused
for
a
minute
or
two
do
nt
let
her
come
near
me
he
moaned
once
more
in
a
piteous
voice
do
nt
let
her
come
near
me
i
will
not
i
answered
she
shall
not
come
near
you
i
spare
you
that
but
you
will
have
to
eat
the
food
she
prepares
and
you
know
she
will
not
poison
you
you
will
have
to
be
tended
by
the
servants
she
chooses
and
you
know
they
will
not
murder
you
she
can
heap
coals
of
fire
on
your
head
without
coming
into
your
tent
consider
that
you
sought
to
take
her
life
and
she
seeks
to
save
yours
she
is
as
anxious
to
keep
you
alive
as
you
are
anxious
to
kill
her
he
lay
as
in
a
reverie
his
long
white
hair
made
his
clear
cut
thin
face
look
more
unearthly
than
ever
with
the
hectic
flush
of
fever
upon
it
at
last
he
turned
to
me
we
each
work
for
our
own
ends
he
said
in
a
weary
way
we
pursue
our
own
objects
it
suits
me
to
get
rid
of
her
it
suits
her
to
keep
me
alive
i
am
no
good
to
her
dead
living
she
expects
to
wring
a
confession
out
of
me
but
she
shall
not
have
it
tenacity
of
purpose
is
the
one
thing
i
admire
in
life
she
has
the
tenacity
of
purpose
and
so
have
i
cumberledge
do
nt
you
see
it
is
a
mere
duel
of
endurance
between
us
and
may
the
just
side
win
i
answered
solemnly
it
was
several
days
later
before
he
spoke
to
me
of
it
again
hilda
had
brought
some
food
to
the
door
of
the
tent
and
passed
it
in
to
me
for
our
patient
how
is
he
now
she
whispered
sebastian
overheard
her
voice
and
cowering
within
himself
still
managed
to
answer
better
getting
better
i
shall
soon
be
well
now
you
have
carried
your
point
you
have
cured
your
enemy
thank
god
for
that
hilda
said
and
glided
away
silently
sebastian
ate
his
cup
of
arrowroot
in
silence
then
he
looked
at
me
with
wistful
musing
eyes
cumberledge
he
murmured
at
last
after
all
i
ca
nt
help
admiring
that
woman
she
is
the
only
person
who
has
ever
checkmated
me
she
checkmates
me
every
time
steadfastness
is
what
i
love
her
steadfastness
of
purpose
and
her
determination
move
me
i
wish
they
would
move
you
to
tell
the
truth
i
answered
he
mused
again
to
tell
the
truth
he
muttered
moving
his
head
up
and
down
i
have
lived
for
science
shall
i
wreck
all
now
there
are
truths
which
it
is
better
to
hide
than
to
proclaim
uncomfortable
truths
truths
that
never
should
have
been
truths
which
help
to
make
greater
truths
incredible
but
all
the
same
i
cannot
help
admiring
that
woman
she
has
yorke
bannerman
s
intellect
with
a
great
deal
more
than
yorke
bannerman
s
force
of
will
such
firmness
such
energy
such
resolute
patience
she
is
a
wonderful
creature
i
ca
nt
help
admiring
her
i
said
no
more
to
him
just
then
i
thought
it
better
to
let
nascent
remorse
and
nascent
admiration
work
out
their
own
natural
effects
unimpeded
for
i
could
see
our
enemy
was
beginning
to
feel
some
sting
of
remorse
some
men
are
below
it
sebastian
thought
himself
above
it
i
felt
sure
he
was
mistaken
yet
even
in
the
midst
of
these
personal
preoccupations
i
saw
that
our
great
teacher
was
still
as
ever
the
pure
man
of
science
he
noted
every
symptom
and
every
change
of
the
disease
with
professional
accuracy
he
observed
his
own
case
whenever
his
mind
was
clear
enough
as
impartially
as
he
would
have
observed
any
outside
patient
s
this
is
a
rare
chance
cumberledge
he
whispered
to
me
once
in
an
interval
of
delirium
so
few
europeans
have
ever
had
the
complaint
and
probably
none
who
were
competent
to
describe
the
specific
subjective
and
psychological
symptoms
the
delusions
one
gets
as
one
sinks
into
the
coma
for
example
are
of
quite
a
peculiar
type
delusions
of
wealth
and
of
absolute
power
most
exhilarating
and
magnificent
i
think
myself
a
millionaire
or
a
prime
minister
be
sure
you
make
a
note
of
that
in
case
i
die
if
i
recover
depends
whether
or
not
i
shall
entrust
you
with
knowledge
regarding
him
swear
to
me
by
the
three
kings
of
cologne
that
you
will
tell
to
none
what
i
will
now
impart
to
you
i
swear
said
elsa
raising
her
right
hand
and
holding
aloft
the
sword
with
it
wilhelm
is
not
my
son
nor
is
he
kin
to
either
of
us
but
is
the
heir
of
the
greatest
enemy
of
our
house
count
herbert
of
schonburg
i
lured
him
from
his
father
s
home
as
a
child
and
now
send
him
back
as
a
man
some
time
later
i
shall
acquaint
the
count
with
the
fact
that
the
young
man
he
captured
is
his
only
son
the
girl
looked
at
her
uncle
her
eyes
wide
with
horror
it
is
your
purpose
then
that
the
father
shall
execute
his
own
son
the
outlaw
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
result
lies
not
with
me
but
with
the
count
he
was
once
a
crusader
and
the
teaching
of
his
master
is
to
the
effect
that
the
measure
he
metes
to
others
the
same
shall
be
meted
to
him
if
i
remember
aright
the
tenets
of
his
faith
count
herbert
wreaking
vengeance
upon
my
supposed
son
is
really
bringing
destruction
upon
his
own
which
seems
but
justice
if
he
show
mercy
to
me
and
mine
he
is
bestowing
the
blessed
balm
thereof
on
himself
and
his
house
in
this
imperfect
world
few
events
are
ordered
with
such
admirable
equity
as
the
capture
of
young
lord
wilhelm
by
that
haughty
and
bloodthirsty
warrior
his
father
let
us
then
await
with
patience
the
outcome
taking
care
not
to
interfere
with
the
designs
of
providence
the
design
comes
not
from
god
but
from
the
evil
one
himself
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
deity
to
overturn
even
the
best
plans
of
the
fiend
if
it
be
his
will
let
us
see
to
it
that
we
do
not
intervene
between
two
such
ghostly
potentates
remembering
that
we
are
but
puny
creatures
liable
to
err
the
plot
is
of
your
making
secretly
held
all
these
years
with
unrelenting
malignity
the
devil
himself
is
not
wicked
enough
to
send
an
innocent
loyal
lad
to
his
doom
in
his
own
mother
s
house
with
his
father
as
his
executioner
oh
uncle
uncle
repent
and
make
reparation
before
it
is
too
late
let
the
count
repent
and
make
reparation
i
have
now
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
as
i
have
said
if
the
count
is
merciful
he
is
like
to
be
glad
of
it
later
in
his
life
if
he
is
revengeful
visiting
the
sin
of
the
father
on
the
son
innocent
i
think
you
called
him
then
he
deserves
what
his
own
hand
deals
out
to
himself
but
we
have
talked
too
much
already
i
ask
you
to
remember
your
oath
for
i
have
told
you
this
so
that
you
will
not
bring
ridicule
upon
me
by
a
womanish
appeal
to
my
own
men
who
would
but
laugh
at
you
in
any
case
and
think
me
a
dotard
in
allowing
women
overmuch
to
say
in
the
camp
get
you
back
to
your
women
for
we
move
camp
instantly
even
if
i
were
to
relent
as
you
term
it
the
time
is
past
for
wilhelm
is
either
dangling
from
the
walls
of
castle
schonburg
or
he
is
pardoned
and
all
that
we
could
do
would
be
of
little
avail
prepare
you
then
instantly
for
our
journey
elsa
with
a
sigh
went
slowly
to
the
women
s
quarters
her
oath
the
most
terrible
that
may
be
taken
on
the
rhine
weighing
heavily
upon
her
resolving
not
to
break
it
yet
determined
in
some
way
to
save
wilhelm
the
girl
spent
the
first
part
of
the
journey
in
revolving
plans
of
escape
for
she
found
as
the
cavalcade
progressed
that
her
uncle
did
not
trust
entirely
to
the
binding
qualities
of
the
oath
she
had
taken
but
had
her
closely
watched
as
well
as
the
expedition
progressed
farther
and
farther
south
in
the
direction
of
mayence
vigilance
was
relaxed
and
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
when
a
camp
had
been
selected
for
the
night
elsa
escaped
and
hurried
eastward
through
the
forest
until
she
came
to
the
rhine
which
was
to
be
her
guide
to
the
castle
of
schonburg
the
windings
of
the
river
made
the
return
longer
than
the
direct
journey
through
the
wilderness
had
been
and
in
addition
to
this
elsa
was
compelled
to
circumambulate
the
numerous
castles
climbing
the
hills
to
avoid
them
fearing
capture
and
delay
so
it
was
not
until
the
sun
was
declining
on
the
sixth
day
after
the
assault
on
the
castle
that
she
stood
weary
and
tattered
and
unkempt
before
the
closed
gates
of
schonburg
and
beat
feebly
with
her
small
hand
against
the
oak
crying
for
admittance
the
guard
of
the
gate
seeing
through
the
small
lattice
but
a
single
dishevelled
woman
standing
there
anticipating
treachery
refused
to
open
the
little
door
in
the
large
leaf
until
his
captain
was
summoned
who
after
some
parley
allowed
the
girl
to
enter
the
courtyard
what
do
you
want
asked
the
captain
curtly
she
asked
instead
of
answered
is
your
prisoner
still
alive
the
son
of
the
outlaw
yes
but
he
would
be
a
confident
prophet
who
would
predict
as
much
for
him
at
this
hour
to
morrow
take
me
i
beg
of
you
to
the
countess
that
is
as
it
may
be
who
are
you
and
what
is
your
business
with
her
i
shall
reveal
myself
to
her
ladyship
and
to
her
will
state
the
object
of
my
coming
your
object
is
plain
enough
you
are
some
tatterdemalion
of
the
forest
come
to
beg
the
life
of
your
lover
who
hangs
to
morrow
or
i
am
a
heathen
saracen
i
do
beseech
you
tell
the
countess
that
a
miserable
woman
craves
permission
to
speak
with
her
what
success
might
have
attended
her
petition
is
uncertain
but
the
problem
was
solved
by
the
appearance
and
as
such
to
be
honored
by
those
who
call
themselves
his
friends
and
she
is
not
to
be
lightly
spoken
of
nor
comment
passed
upon
her
grace
beauty
and
bearing
something
too
great
for
her
station
i
admit
lest
idle
tales
should
get
abroad
am
i
not
thy
friend
ralph
he
asked
with
smiling
eyes
i
have
thought
so
at
times
i
answered
my
friend
s
honor
is
my
honor
he
went
on
where
his
lips
are
sealed
mine
open
not
art
content
content
i
said
and
pressed
the
hand
he
held
out
to
me
we
reached
the
steps
of
the
wharf
and
descending
them
he
entered
his
barge
rocking
lazily
with
the
advancing
tide
his
rowers
cast
loose
from
the
piles
and
the
black
water
slowly
widened
between
us
from
over
my
shoulder
came
a
sudden
bright
gleam
of
light
from
the
house
above
and
i
knew
that
mistress
percy
was
as
usual
wasting
good
pine
knots
i
had
a
vision
of
the
many
lights
within
and
of
the
beauty
whom
the
world
called
my
wife
sitting
erect
bathed
in
that
rosy
glow
in
the
great
armchair
with
the
turbaned
negress
behind
her
i
suppose
rolfe
saw
the
same
thing
for
he
looked
from
the
light
to
me
and
i
heard
him
draw
his
breath
ralph
percy
thou
art
the
very
button
upon
the
cap
of
fortune
he
said
to
myself
my
laugh
sounded
something
of
the
bitterest
but
to
him
i
presume
it
vaunted
my
return
through
the
darkness
to
the
lit
room
and
its
resplendent
pearl
he
waved
farewell
and
the
dusk
swallowed
up
him
and
his
boat
i
went
back
to
the
house
and
to
her
she
was
sitting
as
we
had
left
her
with
her
small
feet
crossed
upon
the
cushion
beneath
them
her
hands
folded
in
her
silken
lap
the
air
from
the
waving
fan
blowing
tendrils
of
her
dark
hair
against
her
delicate
standing
ruff
i
went
and
leaned
against
the
window
facing
her
i
have
been
chosen
burgess
for
this
hundred
i
said
abruptly
the
assembly
meets
next
week
i
must
be
in
jamestown
then
and
for
some
time
to
come
she
took
the
fan
from
the
negress
and
waved
it
lazily
to
and
fro
when
do
we
go
she
asked
at
last
we
i
answered
i
had
thought
to
go
alone
the
fan
dropped
to
the
floor
and
her
eyes
opened
wide
and
leave
me
here
she
exclaimed
leave
me
in
these
woods
at
the
mercy
of
indians
wolves
and
your
rabble
of
servants
i
smiled
we
are
at
peace
with
the
indians
it
would
be
a
stout
wolf
that
could
leap
this
palisade
and
the
servants
know
their
master
too
well
to
care
to
offend
their
mistress
moreover
i
would
leave
diccon
in
charge
diccon
she
cried
the
old
woman
in
the
kitchen
hath
told
me
tales
of
diccon
diccon
bravo
diccon
gamester
diccon
cutthroat
granted
i
said
but
diccon
faithful
as
well
i
can
trust
him
but
i
do
not
trust
him
she
retorted
and
i
wish
to
go
to
jamestown
this
forest
wearies
me
her
tone
was
imperious
i
must
think
it
over
i
said
coolly
i
may
take
you
or
i
may
not
i
cannot
tell
yet
but
i
desire
to
go
sir
and
i
may
desire
you
to
stay
you
are
a
churl
i
bowed
i
am
the
man
of
your
choice
madam
she
rose
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
and
turning
her
back
upon
me
took
a
flower
from
the
table
and
commenced
to
pull
from
it
its
petals
i
unsheathed
my
sword
and
seating
myself
began
to
polish
away
a
speck
of
rust
upon
the
blade
ten
minutes
later
i
looked
up
from
the
task
to
receive
full
in
my
face
a
red
rose
tossed
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
missile
was
followed
by
an
enchanting
burst
of
laughter
we
cannot
afford
to
quarrel
can
we
cried
mistress
jocelyn
percy
life
is
sad
enough
in
this
solitude
without
that
nothing
but
trees
and
water
all
day
long
and
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
and
i
am
horribly
afraid
of
the
indians
what
if
they
were
to
kill
me
while
you
were
away
you
know
you
swore
before
the
minister
to
protect
me
you
wo
nt
leave
me
to
the
mercies
of
the
savages
will
you
and
i
may
go
to
jamestown
may
nt
i
i
want
to
go
to
church
i
want
to
go
to
the
governor
s
house
i
want
to
buy
a
many
things
i
have
gold
in
plenty
and
but
this
one
decent
dress
you
ll
take
me
with
you
wo
nt
you
there
s
not
your
like
in
virginia
i
told
her
if
you
go
to
town
clad
like
that
and
with
that
bearing
there
will
be
talk
enough
and
ships
come
and
go
and
there
are
those
besides
rolfe
who
have
been
to
london
for
a
moment
the
laughter
died
from
her
eyes
and
lips
but
it
returned
let
them
talk
she
said
what
care
i
and
i
do
not
think
your
ship
captains
your
traders
and
adventurers
do
often
dine
with
my
lord
bishop
this
barbarous
forest
world
and
another
world
that
i
wot
of
are
so
far
apart
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
one
do
not
trouble
those
of
the
other
in
that
petty
village
down
there
i
am
safe
enough
besides
sir
you
wear
a
sword
my
sword
is
ever
at
your
service
madam
then
i
may
go
to
jamestown
if
you
will
it
so
with
her
bright
eyes
upon
me
and
with
one
hand
softly
striking
a
rose
against
her
laughing
lips
she
extended
the
other
hand
you
may
kiss
it
if
you
wish
sir
she
said
demurely
i
knelt
and
kissed
the
white
fingers
and
four
days
later
we
went
to
jamestown
chapter
vi
in
which
we
go
to
jamestown
it
was
early
morning
when
we
set
out
on
horseback
for
jamestown
i
rode
in
front
with
mistress
see
what
george
hagar
saw
in
mark
telford
s
looks
telford
s
glance
went
round
the
crowd
appearing
to
rest
for
an
instant
on
every
person
and
for
a
longer
time
on
hagar
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
both
were
immediately
puzzled
for
each
had
a
sensation
of
some
subterranean
origin
telford
immediately
afterward
passed
out
of
the
gate
and
went
toward
the
st
cloud
gardens
where
the
band
was
playing
for
a
time
hagar
did
not
stir
but
idled
with
his
pencil
and
notebook
suddenly
he
started
and
hurried
out
in
the
direction
telford
had
gone
i
was
an
ass
he
said
to
himself
not
to
think
of
that
at
first
he
entered
the
st
cloud
gardens
and
walked
round
the
promenade
a
few
times
but
without
finding
him
presently
however
alpheus
richmond
whose
beautiful
and
brilliant
waistcoat
and
brass
buttons
with
monogram
adorned
showed
advantageously
in
the
morning
sunshine
said
to
him
i
say
hagar
who
s
that
chap
up
there
filling
the
door
of
the
summer
house
lord
rather
it
was
telford
hagar
wished
for
the
slightest
pretext
to
go
up
the
unfrequented
side
path
and
speak
to
him
but
his
mind
was
too
excited
to
do
the
thing
naturally
without
a
stout
pretext
besides
though
he
admired
the
man
s
proportions
and
his
uses
from
an
artistic
standpoint
he
did
not
like
him
personally
and
he
said
that
he
never
could
he
had
instinctive
likes
and
dislikes
what
had
startled
him
at
the
pump
room
and
had
made
him
come
to
the
gardens
was
the
conviction
that
this
was
the
man
to
play
the
part
in
the
scene
which
described
by
mrs
detlor
had
been
arranging
itself
in
a
hundred
ways
in
his
brain
during
the
night
the
central
figures
always
the
same
the
details
light
tone
coloring
expression
fusing
resolving
then
came
another
and
still
more
significant
thought
on
this
he
had
acted
when
he
had
got
rid
of
richmond
who
begged
that
he
would
teach
him
how
to
arrange
a
tie
as
he
did
for
which
an
hour
was
appointed
he
determined
at
all
hazards
to
speak
he
had
a
cigar
in
his
pocket
and
though
to
smoke
in
the
morning
was
pain
and
grief
to
him
he
determined
to
ask
for
a
match
and
started
he
was
stopped
by
baron
whose
thoughts
being
much
with
the
little
vices
of
man
anticipated
his
wishes
and
offered
him
a
light
in
despair
hagar
took
it
and
asked
if
he
chanced
to
know
who
the
stranger
was
baron
did
know
assuring
hagar
that
he
sat
on
the
gentleman
s
right
at
the
same
table
in
his
hotel
and
was
qualified
to
introduce
him
before
they
started
he
told
the
artist
of
the
occurrence
of
the
evening
before
and
further
assured
him
of
the
graces
of
miss
mildred
margrave
a
pearl
he
said
not
to
be
reckoned
by
loads
of
ivory
nor
jolly
bricks
of
gold
nor
caravans
of
arab
steeds
nor
come
and
have
dinner
with
me
to
night
and
you
shall
see
there
what
do
you
say
hagar
who
loved
the
man
s
unique
and
spontaneous
character
as
only
an
artist
can
love
a
subject
in
which
he
sees
royal
possibilities
consented
gladly
and
dropped
a
cordial
hand
on
the
other
s
shoulder
the
hand
was
dragged
down
and
wrenched
back
and
forth
with
a
sturdy
clasp
in
time
to
a
roll
of
round
unctuous
laughter
then
baron
took
him
up
hurriedly
and
introduced
him
to
telford
with
the
words
you
two
ought
to
know
each
other
telford
traveler
officer
of
the
hudson
s
bay
company
et
cetera
hagar
artist
good
fellow
et
cetera
then
he
drew
back
and
smiled
as
the
two
men
not
shaking
hands
as
he
expected
bowed
and
said
they
were
happy
to
meet
the
talk
began
with
the
remark
by
hagar
on
the
panorama
below
them
that
the
thing
was
amusing
if
not
seen
too
often
but
the
eternal
paddling
round
the
band
stand
was
too
much
like
marionettes
you
prefer
a
punch
and
judy
to
marionettes
asked
telford
yes
you
get
a
human
element
in
a
punch
and
judy
tragedy
besides
it
has
surprises
according
to
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
man
in
the
greenroom
he
smiled
immediately
remembering
that
his
last
words
plagiarized
mr
alpheus
richmond
i
never
miss
a
punch
and
judy
if
i
m
near
it
said
telford
i
enjoy
the
sardonic
humor
with
which
punch
hustles
off
his
victims
his
light
heartedness
when
doing
bloody
deeds
is
the
true
temper
that
is
if
it
must
be
done
to
do
it
with
a
grin
is
is
the
most
absolute
tragedy
hagar
was
astonished
for
even
the
trader
s
information
that
telford
spoke
excellent
french
and
had
certainly
been
a
deal
on
red
carpet
in
his
time
did
not
prepare
him
for
the
sharply
incisive
words
just
uttered
yet
it
was
not
incongruous
with
telford
s
appearance
not
even
with
the
red
sash
peeping
at
the
edge
of
his
waistcoat
they
came
down
among
the
promenaders
and
baron
being
accosted
by
some
one
he
left
the
two
together
exacting
anew
the
promise
from
hagar
regarding
dinner
presently
hagar
looked
up
and
said
abruptly
you
were
singing
outside
my
window
last
night
telford
s
face
was
turned
away
from
him
when
he
began
it
came
slowly
toward
him
the
eyes
closed
steadily
with
his
there
was
no
excitement
only
cold
alertness
indeed
what
was
i
singing
for
one
thing
the
chant
of
the
negro
woodcutters
of
louisiana
what
part
of
louisiana
the
county
of
tellavie
chiefly
telford
drew
a
long
breath
as
though
some
suspense
was
over
and
then
said
how
did
you
know
it
was
i
i
could
scarcely
tell
you
i
got
the
impression
besides
you
are
the
only
man
i
ve
seen
in
herridon
who
looks
likely
to
know
it
and
the
song
which
you
prompted
do
i
look
like
a
southerner
still
you
see
i
ve
been
in
an
arctic
country
five
years
