surprise
was
that
he
had
nt
learned
to
talk
better
himself
it
was
nt
for
lack
of
earnest
effort
but
biology
was
against
him
and
what
with
the
configuration
of
muzzle
teeth
and
tongue
that
fate
had
saddled
a
series
of
yaps
and
yawns
and
yowls
a
mooning
muddled
sort
of
discourse
he
was
painfully
aware
of
how
far
from
fluency
these
noises
fell
but
willy
always
let
him
have
his
say
and
in
the
end
that
was
all
that
mattered
mr
bones
was
free
to
put
in
his
two
cents
and
whenever
he
did
so
his
master
would
give
him
his
full
attention
and
to
look
at
willy
s
face
as
he
watched
his
friend
struggle
to
make
like
a
member
of
the
human
tribe
you
would
have
sworn
that
he
was
hanging
on
every
word
that
gloomy
sunday
in
baltimore
however
mr
bones
kept
his
mouth
shut
they
were
down
to
their
last
days
together
perhaps
even
their
last
hours
and
this
was
no
time
to
indulge
in
long
speeches
and
loopy
contortions
no
time
for
the
old
shenanigans
certain
situations
called
for
tact
and
discipline
and
in
their
present
dire
straits
it
would
be
far
better
to
hold
his
tongue
and
behave
like
a
good
loyal
dog
without
protest
he
did
nt
whine
about
not
having
eaten
in
the
past
thirty
six
hours
he
did
nt
sniff
the
air
for
female
scents
he
did
nt
stop
to
pee
on
every
lamppost
and
fire
hydrant
he
simply
ambled
along
beside
willy
following
his
master
as
they
searched
the
empty
avenues
for
calvert
street
mr
bones
had
nothing
against
baltimore
per
se
it
smelled
no
worse
than
any
other
city
they
d
camped
in
over
the
years
but
even
though
he
understood
the
purpose
of
the
trip
it
grieved
him
to
think
that
a
man
could
choose
to
spend
his
last
moments
on
earth
in
a
place
he
d
never
been
to
before
a
dog
would
never
commit
such
a
blunder
he
would
make
his
peace
with
the
world
and
then
see
to
it
that
he
gave
up
the
ghost
on
familiar
ground
but
willy
still
had
two
things
to
accomplish
before
he
died
and
with
characteristic
stubbornness
he
d
gotten
it
into
his
head
that
there
was
only
one
person
who
could
help
him
the
said
bea
swanson
was
last
known
to
be
living
in
baltimore
they
had
come
to
baltimore
to
find
her
all
well
and
good
but
unless
willy
s
plan
did
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
mr
bones
would
be
marooned
in
this
city
of
crab
cakes
and
marble
steps
and
what
was
he
going
to
do
then
a
phone
call
would
have
done
the
job
in
half
a
minute
but
willy
had
a
philosophical
aversion
to
using
the
telephone
for
important
business
he
would
rather
walk
for
days
on
end
than
pick
up
one
of
those
contraptions
and
talk
to
someone
he
could
nt
see
so
here
they
were
two
hundred
miles
later
wandering
around
the
streets
of
baltimore
without
a
map
looking
for
an
address
that
might
or
might
not
exist
of
the
two
things
willy
still
hoped
to
accomplish
before
he
died
neither
one
took
precedence
over
the
other
each
was
all
important
to
him
and
since
time
had
grown
too
short
to
think
of
tackling
them
separately
he
had
come
up
with
what
ploy
to
kill
both
birds
with
one
stone
the
first
has
already
been
discussed
in
the
previous
paragraphs
to
find
new
digs
for
his
furry
companion
the
second
was
to
wrap
up
his
own
affairs
and
make
sure
that
his
manuscripts
were
left
in
good
hands
at
that
moment
his
life
s
work
was
crammed
into
a
rental
locker
at
the
greyhound
bus
terminal
on
fayette
street
two
and
a
half
blocks
north
of
where
he
and
mr
bones
were
standing
the
key
was
in
his
pocket
and
unless
he
found
someone
worthy
enough
to
entrust
with
that
key
every
word
he
had
ever
written
would
be
destroyed
disposed
of
as
so
much
unclaimed
baggage
in
the
twenty
three
years
since
he
d
taken
on
the
surname
of
christmas
willy
had
filled
the
pages
of
seventy
four
notebooks
with
his
writings
these
included
poems
stories
essays
diary
entries
epigrams
autobiographical
musings
and
the
first
eighteen
hundred
lines
of
an
epic
in
progress
vagabond
days
the
majority
of
these
works
had
been
composed
at
the
but
since
her
death
four
years
ago
he
d
been
forced
to
write
in
the
open
air
often
battling
the
elements
in
public
parks
and
dusty
alleyways
as
he
struggled
to
get
his
thoughts
down
on
paper
in
his
secret
i
heart
of
hearts
willy
had
no
delusions
about
himself
he
knew
that
he
was
a
troubled
soul
and
not
fit
for
this
world
but
he
also
knew
that
much
good
work
was
buried
in
those
notebooks
and
on
that
score
at
least
he
could
hold
his
head
high
maybe
if
he
had
been
more
scrupulous
about
taking
his
medication
or
maybe
if
his
body
had
been
a
bit
stronger
or
maybe
if
he
had
nt
been
so
fond
of
malts
and
spirits
and
the
hubbub
of
bars
he
might
have
done
even
more
good
work
that
was
perfectly
possible
but
it
was
too
late
to
dwell
on
regrets
and
errors
now
willy
had
written
the
last
sentence
he
would
ever
write
and
there
were
no
more
than
a
few
ticks
left
in
the
clock
the
for
himself
if
the
words
vanished
it
would
be
as
if
he
had
never
lived
that
was
where
bea
swanson
entered
the
picture
willy
knew
it
was
a
stab
in
the
dark
but
if
and
when
he
managed
to
find
her
he
was
convinced
that
she
would
move
heaven
and
earth
to
help
him
once
upon
a
time
back
when
the
world
was
still
young
mrs
swanson
had
been
his
high
school
english
teacher
and
if
not
for
her
it
was
doubtful
that
cost
most
of
a
dollar
when
i
was
a
kid
i
used
to
get
a
nickel
for
candy
and
that
only
twice
a
week
icee
she
yelled
in
my
face
the
kitchen
in
her
dull
little
voice
she
was
nt
dull
in
the
head
she
just
talked
low
like
a
bad
cowboy
actor
nu
nu
sat
up
in
the
portacrib
and
gargled
something
so
i
gathered
everyone
up
put
them
in
the
caprice
and
drove
them
down
to
the
gumwood
pak
a
sak
the
baby
was
in
my
lap
when
i
pulled
up
freddie
tuning
in
some
rock
music
that
sounded
like
hail
on
a
tin
roof
two
guys
i
know
older
than
me
watched
us
roll
to
the
curb
when
i
turned
the
engine
off
i
could
barely
hear
one
of
them
say
here
comes
bruton
and
his
bastardmobile
i
grabbed
the
steering
wheel
hard
and
looked
down
on
the
top
of
nu
nu
s
head
feeling
like
someone
just
told
me
my
house
burned
down
i
m
naturally
tanned
so
the
old
men
could
nt
see
the
shame
rising
in
my
face
i
got
out
pretending
i
did
nt
hear
anything
nu
nu
in
the
crook
of
my
arm
like
older
guy
and
break
his
upper
plate
but
i
could
see
the
article
in
the
local
paper
i
could
imagine
the
memories
the
kids
would
have
of
their
grandfather
whaling
away
at
two
snuff
dripping
geezers
i
looked
them
in
the
eye
and
smiled
surprising
even
myself
bastardmobile
man
hey
bruton
the
younger
one
said
a
mr
fordlyson
maybe
sixty
five
all
them
kids
yours
you
start
over
grandkids
i
said
holding
nu
nu
over
his
shoes
so
maybe
he
d
drool
on
them
the
older
one
wore
a
straw
fedora
and
was
nicked
up
in
twenty
places
with
skin
cancer
operations
he
snorted
maybe
you
can
do
better
with
this
batch
he
told
me
i
remembered
then
that
he
was
also
a
mr
fordlyson
the
other
guy
s
uncle
he
used
to
run
the
hardwood
sawmill
north
of
town
was
a
deacon
in
the
baptist
church
and
owned
about
percent
of
the
pissant
bank
down
next
to
the
gin
then
every
old
man
in
town
who
had
five
dollars
in
his
pocket
and
an
opinion
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
thought
the
same
i
pushed
past
him
and
went
into
the
pak
a
sak
the
kids
saw
the
candy
rack
and
cried
out
for
mars
bars
and
zeroes
even
nu
nu
put
out
a
slobbery
hand
toward
the
gummy
worms
but
i
ignored
their
whining
and
drew
them
each
a
small
coke
icee
tammynette
and
moonbean
grabbed
theirs
and
headed
for
the
door
freddie
took
his
carefully
when
i
offered
it
nu
nu
might
be
kind
of
wobble
headed
and
plain
as
a
melon
but
he
sure
knew
what
an
icee
was
and
how
to
go
after
a
straw
and
what
a
smile
when
that
coke
syrup
hit
those
bald
gums
of
his
right
then
freddie
looked
up
at
me
with
his
green
eyes
in
that
speckled
face
and
said
what
s
a
bastardmobile
i
guess
my
mouth
dropped
open
i
do
nt
know
what
you
re
talking
about
i
thought
we
we
are
well
that
man
said
we
was
in
a
never
mind
what
he
said
you
must
have
misheard
him
i
nudged
him
toward
the
door
and
we
went
out
the
older
mr
fordlyson
was
watching
us
like
we
were
a
parade
i
was
trying
to
look
straight
ahead
in
my
mind
the
newspaper
bore
the
headline
local
man
arrested
with
grandchildren
for
assault
i
got
into
the
car
with
the
kids
and
looked
back
out
at
the
fordlysons
where
they
sat
on
a
bumper
rail
sweating
through
their
white
shirts
and
staring
at
us
all
their
kids
owned
sawmills
ran
fast
food
franchises
were
on
the
school
board
they
were
all
married
i
guess
the
young
fordlysons
were
smart
though
looking
at
that
pair
you
d
never
know
where
they
got
their
brains
i
started
my
car
and
backed
out
onto
the
highway
trying
not
to
think
but
to
me
the
word
was
spelled
out
in
chrome
script
on
my
fenders
bastardmobile
on
s
straw
and
he
jerked
it
away
and
called
her
something
i
d
only
heard
the
younger
workers
at
the
plywood
mill
say
the
words
hit
me
in
the
back
of
the
head
like
a
brick
and
i
pulled
off
the
road
onto
the
gravel
shoulder
what
d
you
say
boy
nothing
but
he
reddened
i
saw
he
cared
what
i
thought
kids
your
age
do
nt
use
language
like
that
tammynette
flipped
her
hair
and
raised
her
chin
how
old
you
got
to
be
i
gave
her
a
look
do
nt
you
care
what
he
said
to
you
it
s
what
they
say
on
the
comedy
program
freddie
said
everybody
says
that
what
comedy
program
it
comes
on
after
the
nighttime
news
what
you
doing
up
late
at
night
he
just
stared
at
me
and
i
saw
that
he
had
no
idea
of
what
late
was
glendine
of
the
set
every
night
i
pictured
him
crumpled
up
on
that
smelly
shag
rug
his
mamma
keeps
in
front
of
the
tv
to
catch
the
spills
and
crumbs
when
i
got
home
i
took
them
all
out
on
our
covered
side
porch
the
girls
began
to
struggle
with
jacks
their
little
ball
bouncing
crooked
on
the
slanted
floor
freddie
played
tunes
on
his
icee
straw
and
nu
nu
fell
asleep
in
my
lap
i
stared
at
my
car
and
wondered
if
its
name
had
spread
throughout
the
community
if
everywhere
i
drove
people
would
call
out
here
comes
the
bastardmobile
gumwood
is
one
of
those
towns
where
everybody
looks
at
everything
that
moves
i
do
it
myself
if
my
neighbor
miss
hanchy
pulls
out
of
her
lane
i
wonder
now
where
is
the
old
bat
off
to
it
s
two
thirty
so
her
soap
opera
must
be
over
i
figure
her
nothing
green
here
and
it
s
spring
outside
southern
spring
i
can
smell
it
through
moment
on
flowers
to
kill
to
drink
blood
and
to
have
flowers
not
good
enough
want
to
make
the
book
he
said
want
to
make
it
now
and
want
you
to
come
with
me
i
wo
nt
hang
around
forever
oh
nonsense
of
course
you
will
you
think
i
m
a
doll
do
nt
you
you
think
i
m
cute
and
made
of
poured
wax
and
you
ll
stay
as
long
as
i
stay
you
re
a
bit
mean
armand
you
look
like
an
angel
and
talk
like
a
common
thug
such
arrogance
i
thought
you
wanted
me
only
on
certain
terms
you
lie
david
talbot
i
said
i
headed
past
him
for
the
stairs
cicadas
sang
in
the
night
as
they
often
do
to
no
clock
in
new
orleans
through
the
nine
pane
windows
of
the
stairwell
i
glimpsed
the
flowering
trees
of
spring
a
followed
down
and
down
we
went
walking
like
regular
men
down
to
the
first
floor
and
out
the
sparkling
glass
doors
and
into
the
broad
lighted
space
of
napoleon
avenue
with
its
damp
sweet
park
of
green
down
the
middle
a
park
thick
with
carefully
planted
flowers
and
old
gnarled
and
humble
bending
trees
the
whole
picture
moved
with
the
subtle
river
winds
and
wet
mist
swirled
but
would
not
fall
into
rain
itself
and
tiny
green
leaves
drifted
down
like
wilting
ashes
to
the
ground
soft
soft
southern
spring
even
the
sky
seemed
pregnant
with
the
season
lowering
yet
blushing
with
reflected
light
giving
birth
to
the
mist
from
all
its
pores
strident
perfume
rose
from
the
gardens
right
and
left
from
purple
four
o
clocks
as
mortals
call
them
here
a
rampant
flower
like
unto
weed
but
infinitely
sweet
and
the
wild
irises
stabbing
upwards
like
blades
out
of
the
black
mud
throaty
petals
monstrously
big
battering
themselves
on
old
walls
and
concrete
steps
and
then
as
roses
of
the
young
roses
too
whole
for
the
tropical
night
roses
coated
with
poison
there
had
been
streetcars
here
once
on
this
center
strip
of
grass
i
knew
it
that
the
tracks
had
run
along
this
wide
deep
green
space
where
i
walked
ahead
of
him
slumward
riverward
deathward
bloodward
he
came
after
me
i
could
close
my
eyes
as
i
walked
never
losing
a
step
and
see
the
streetcars
come
on
follow
me
i
said
describing
what
he
did
not
inviting
him
blocks
and
blocks
within
seconds
he
kept
up
very
strong
the
blood
of
an
entire
royal
vampire
court
was
inside
him
no
doubt
of
it
count
on
lestat
to
make
the
most
lethal
of
monsters
that
is
after
his
initial
seductive
blunders
nicolas
louis
claudia
not
a
single
one
of
the
three
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
alone
and
two
perished
and
one
lingering
and
perhaps
the
weakest
vampire
yet
walking
in
the
great
brown
face
startled
me
he
looked
lacquered
all
over
waxed
buffed
and
once
again
i
thought
of
spicy
things
of
the
meat
of
candied
nuts
and
delicious
aromas
of
chocolates
sweet
with
sugar
and
dark
rich
butterscotch
and
it
seemed
a
good
thing
suddenly
to
maybe
grab
ahold
of
him
but
this
was
no
substitute
for
one
rotten
cheap
ripe
and
odoriferous
mortal
and
guess
what
i
pointed
over
there
he
looked
as
i
directed
him
he
saw
the
sagging
line
of
old
buildings
mortals
everywhere
lurked
slept
sat
dined
wandered
amid
tiny
narrow
stairs
behind
peeling
walls
and
under
cracked
ceilings
i
had
found
one
most
perfect
in
his
wickedness
a
great
flurry
of
hateful
embers
of
malice
and
greed
and
contempt
smoldering
as
he
waited
for
me
we
d
come
to
magazine
street
and
passed
it
but
we
were
not
at
the
river
only
almost
and
this
was
a
street
i
had
no
recollection
of
their
city
louis
s
and
lestat
s
just
a
narrow
street
with
these
houses
the
color
of
driftwood
under
the
moon
and
windows
hung
with
makeshift
coverings
and
inside
there
was
this
one
slouching
arrogant
vicious
mortal
fixed
to
a
television
set
and
guzzling
malt
from
a
brown
bottle
ignoring
the
roaches
and
the
pulsing
heat
that
pressed
in
from
the
open
window
this
ugly
sweating
filthy
and
irresistible
thing
this
flesh
and
blood
for
me
the
house
was
so
alive
with
vermin
and
tiny
despicable
things
that
it
seemed
no
more
than
a
shell
surrounding
him
crackling
and
friable
and
the
same
color
in
all
its
shadows
as
a
forest
no
antiseptic
modern
standards
here
even
the
furniture
rotted
in
the
trashy
clutter
and
damp
mildew
covered
the
grinding
white
refrigerator
only
the
reeky
personal
bed
and
rags
gave
off
the
clue
to
reigning
domesticity
it
was
a
proper
nest
in
which
to
find
this
fowl
this
ugly
bird
thick
rich
pluckable
devourable
sack
of
bones
and
blood
and
shabby
plumage
human
stench
rising
like
a
swirl
of
gnats
and
thereby
put
it
off
its
hinges
but
not
with
much
sound
i
walked
on
newspapers
strewn
on
painted
wood
orange
peels
turned
to
brownish
leather
roaches
running
he
did
nt
even
look
up
his
swollen
drunken
face
was
blue
and
eerie
black
eyebrows
thick
and
unkempt
and
yet
he
looked
quite
possibly
a
bit
angelic
due
to
the
light
from
the
tube
he
flicked
the
magic
plastic
twanger
in
his
hand
to
make
the
channels
change
and
the
light
flared
and
flickered
soundlessly
and
then
he
let
the
song
rise
a
band
playing
a
travesty
people
clapping
trashy
noises
trashy
images
like
the
trash
all
around
him
all
right
i
want
you
no
one
else
does
he
looked
up
at
me
a
boy
invader
david
too
far
off
for
him
to
see
waiting
i
pushed
the
television
set
to
the
side
it
teetered
then
fell
onto
the
floor
its
parts
breaking
now
splinters
of
glass
a
momentary
fury
overcame
him
charging
his
face
with
sluggish
recognition
he
rose
up
arms
out
and
came
and
realized
that
the
opportunity
would
never
be
greater
the
barraclough
sept
which
included
the
lesser
aranlake
and
padualenare
septs
had
not
rallied
to
bunny
s
side
when
brun
returned
the
aranlakes
with
the
exception
of
lady
cecelia
de
marktos
had
supported
an
aranlake
candidate
hubert
roscoe
millander
for
family
head
and
they
d
lost
they
were
home
sulking
the
padualenares
favored
bunny
s
brother
harlis
who
supported
their
claim
to
seniority
over
the
aranlakes
and
their
ambitions
in
the
colonial
worlds
this
left
only
a
few
of
the
barracloughs
themselves
onplanet
those
closest
to
bunny
and
therefore
more
likely
devastated
by
his
death
hobart
glanced
around
the
room
his
gaze
roaming
from
one
proof
of
his
eminence
to
another
would
his
family
be
devastated
if
he
were
assassinated
delphine
would
be
was
all
swollen
and
splotched
with
ugly
color
the
girls
would
cry
but
only
for
awhile
he
was
sure
they
would
look
for
another
patron
another
source
of
favor
and
another
dispenser
of
luxuries
fickle
that
s
what
women
were
unless
you
trained
them
well
as
he
had
trained
delphine
the
boys
thoughif
he
had
brought
them
up
well
they
would
be
planning
already
how
to
avenge
him
and
how
to
gain
more
power
but
he
would
not
be
assassinated
he
would
be
more
careful
than
bunny
more
alert
to
covert
threats
lessnot
less
brave
but
less
foolhardy
brun
had
no
doubt
got
her
foolhardy
genes
from
him
not
from
prudent
miranda
his
excitement
mounted
as
he
went
on
through
the
list
if
he
had
had
bunny
killedand
the
thought
had
crossed
his
mind
more
than
once
in
the
year
when
it
seemed
that
nothing
else
would
get
that
great
fool
out
of
an
office
he
was
unfit
to
fillhe
could
not
have
chosen
a
better
time
he
d
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
fate
had
finally
come
over
to
his
side
he
had
proven
himself
capable
of
succeeding
against
the
worst
fate
could
do
and
now
fatewomanlikehad
chosen
him
for
that
very
energy
and
persistence
and
will
to
triumph
he
closed
his
eyes
a
moment
allowing
himself
the
luxury
of
imagining
the
moment
when
he
took
over
as
speakerwhen
the
faces
which
had
ignored
or
turned
away
turned
to
him
had
to
turn
to
him
and
he
could
finally
show
his
true
abilities
i
will
make
the
familias
great
and
everyone
will
know
who
saved

he

and
he

that

it
did
often
these

to
barin
right
well
keep
a

to
the
ansible
and
i

get
the

the
last
priority
message
had
been
medical
directing
them
to
relieve
senior
ncos
with
rejuv
of
duty
but
they
had
none
aboard
maybe
this
one
would
be
useful
what
she
wanted
was
a
message
from
barin
preferably
with
a
friendly
reaction
from
his
family
being
on
two
different
ships
really
hampered
communication
she
hoped
they
could
meet
in
person
for
a
few
days
captain
solis
knew
she
was
due
leave
he
had
already
said
she
could
take
the
time
off
but
she
d
heard
nothing
captain
solis
never
talkative
this
early
in

became
even
more
silent
after
the

had
gone
to

glanced
over

i
said
nothing
lieutenant
is
dead
assassinated
presumably
his
gaze
dropped
to
the
readout
of
the
decryption
device
presumably
it
s
the
new
texas
militia
in
retaliation
for
our
execution
of
their

a
pause
during
which
esmay
did
her
best
not
to
ask
the
question
that
hammered
at
her

he
answered
it
anyway
lieutenant
you
can
count
on
all
leaves
being
cancelled
i
m
sorry
there
are
some
things
more
urgent
than
a

it

esmay
said
without

solis
gave
her
a
long
look
but
finally
nodded
good
idea
then
if
you
get
the
chance
but
in
the

i
want
a

get
started
on
that

the
announcement

newscast
of
more
concern
is
the
threat
of
renewed
violence
from
the
new
texas
militia
branches
which
were
not
destroyed
by
recognized
from
his
own
occasional
bouts
of
emotional
distress
scott
crouched
down
offered
a
hand
the
bloodied
treecat
bumped
it
with
his
head
begging
for
the
touch
leading
scott
to
wonder
if
this
treecat
had
been
around
humans
before
he
stroked
the
treecat
gently
trying
to
determine
from
that
cautious
touch
how
badly
injured
it
might
be
he
found
no
wounds
to
account
for
the
blood
not
even
a
sign
of
swelling
or
inflammation
but
the
treecat
clung
to
him
and
shivered
and
made
broken
little
sounds
that
horrified
scott
nearly
as
much
as
they
did
fisher
judging
by
the
emotional
aura
his
own
treecat
was
projecting
something
truly
dire
had
happened
to
this
little
treecat
and
scott
received
a
strong
premonition
that
and
his
companion
when
scott
tried
to
pick
the
treecat
up
it
let
out
a
frightened
sound
that
prompted
fisher
to
rest
both
of
his
true
hands
on
the
other
s
nearest
shoulder
a
moment
later
the
filthy
blood
matted
treecat
swarmed
into
scott
s
arms
huddling
close
fisher
jumped
up
to
his
customary
perch
on
scott
s
shoulder
still
crooning
gently
irina
hesitated
some
distance
away
biting
her
lower
lip
uncertainly
scott
nodded
her
closer
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
head
and
she
approached
slowly
while
scott
stroked
the
painfully
thin
treecat
reassuringly
when
irina
stood
beside
him
the
stray
let
out
a
strange
mewling
little
sound
gazing
up
at
her
through
grass
green
eyes
as
deep
and
wounded
as
a
hurt
toddler
s
poor
thing
she
whispered
gently
offering
a
cautious
hand
the
trembling
treecat
permitted
her
touch
arching
slightly
in
scott
s
arms
as
she
stroked
gently
down
its
spine
but
it
was
scott
the
stray
clung
to
all
four
upper
limbs
clenching
in
scott
inside
i
wonder
scott
asked
aloud
moving
cautiously
toward
the
zivonik
house
you
re
hardly
more
than
fur
and
bones
you
need
food
and
water
and
god
knows
what
else
the
washboard
ribcage
under
his
hands
spoke
of
a
prolonged
deprivation
and
he
could
see
cracked
dried
skin
around
the
treecat
s
mouth
eyes
and
delicate
hands
indicating
dehydration
as
well
scott
stroked
the
distraught
treecat
gently
whispering
softly
to
it
as
he
and
irina
slowly
approached
the
meter
thick
stone
walls
of
the
zivonik
house
the
most
cursory
examination
told
him
the
treecat
was
male
toolong
despite
the
dried
blood
in
its
fur
irina

alek
escorted
him
into
the
house
scott
moved
cautiously
inside
with
his
unexpected
patient
irina
trailing
anxiously
at
his
shoulder
and
entered
a
brightly
lit
kitchen
just
in
time
to
see
karl
their
oldest
son
setting
out
a
platter
with
an
enormous
half
stripped
turkey
carcass
the
boy
set
it
down
on
a
broad
wooden
dining
table
built
to
accommodate
a
growing
family

the
boy
addressed
the
bedraggled
treecat
shyly
cheeks
flushed
from
excitement

stasya
the
zivoniks
middle
daughter
was
carrying
a
basin
of
water
to
the
table
eyes
round
with
wonder
as
scott
set
the
thin
treecat
down
it
paused
for
only
a
moment
as
though
making
certain
the
offer
were
genuine
then
tore
into
the
carcass
with
ravenous
the
wondrous
creature
on
their
kitchen
table
very
few
humans
had
actually
seen
one
in
person
even
stolid
broad
shouldered
aleksandr
zivonik
hunkered
down
to
watch
the
starving
treecat
tear
into
the
carcass
with
surprisingly
dainty
hands
visibly
entranced
by
the
sight
of
his
diminutive
sentient
guest
scott
smiled
gently
fisher
he
said
reaching
up
to
stroke
his
friend
i
have
to
go
back
and
help
deliver
that
baby
now
can
you
stay
with
him
scott
had
no
idea
how
much
his
treecat
actually
understood
of
what
he
said
but
he
and
fisher
generally
had
little
trouble
communicating
basic
things
fisher
simply
swarmed
down
his
arm
and
jumped
to
the
table
crooning
softly
to
the
battered
treecat
which
was
busily
stuffing
strips
and
hunks
of
turkey
into
emaciated
jaws
scott
hauled
his
dirt
streaked
shirt
off
smiling
gratefully
at
irina
when
she
carried
it
toward
the
laundry
room
then
scrubbed
his
arms
with
hot
soapy
water
and
disinfectant
at
the
kitchen
sink
and
hurried
back
to
check
on
mrs
zivonik
the
oldest
of
the
zivonik
daughters
said
at
once
how
s
the
treecat
she
added
anxiously
edging
toward
the
hallway
eating
your
turkey
dinner
go
on
see
for
yourself
the
girl
darted
for
the
door
scott
found
his
patient
nearly
as
apprehensive
as
her
daughter
when
evelina
gazed
up
at
him
it
was
nt
injured
she
asked
anxiously
clearly
mrs
zivonik
was
as
worried
over
the
sudden
appearance
of
an
ailing
treecat
on
their
doorstep
as
her
husband
so
little
was
known
about
treecats
the
abrupt
appearance
of
a
healthy
one
was
often
enough
to
upset
the
most
steady
of
settlers
a
starvation
thin
one
with
blood
in
its
fur
was
genuinely
cause
for
fright
and
evelina
zivonik
was
nt
the
only
one
afraid
of
the
reasons
for
that
treecat
s
condition
scott
was
considerably
disturbed
himself
despite
nearly
a
full
t
year
of
daily
contact
with
a
treecat
to
accustom
him
to
their
sometimes
startling
habits
and
behaviors
and
the
last
thing
evelina
zivonik
needed
during
a
breech
presentation
he
tried
to
reassure
her
as
he
resumed
his
interrupted
work
with
the
baby
no
i
did
nt
find
any
actual
injuries
of
course
i
ca
nt
hazard
a
guess
when
he
last
had
a
solid
meal
and
anything
to
drink
but
he
s
wolfing
down
turkey
as
fast
as
he
can
tear
it
off
the
bones
so
went
to
join
his
men
the
vietnamese
positioned
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
field
and
squatted
to
watch
they
seemed
amused
as
the
americans
who
took
the
infield
picked
up
rocks
from
the
base
paths
and
tossed
them
off
the
field
but
their
amusement
ended
when
they
saw
how
well
the
americans
could
sling
a
baseball
around
the
infield
the
air
filled
with
the
pop
of
the
hardball
on
a
leather
glove
t
p
had
pitched
for
his
school
s
baseball
team
he
took
the
mound
as
anderson
caught
and
promptly
struck
out
the
first
four
americans
then
candy
hit
a
booming
fly
ball
and
was
the
first
player
selected
sensibar
shaky
hands
and
all
proved
to
be
a
fine
power
hitter
small
dinked
a
judy
hit
in
the
shallow
outfield
showing
off
his
fielding
skills
at
shortstop
rutkowski
struck
out
and
immediately
started
booking
bets
making
the
americans
a
five
run
favorite
when
anderson
s
turn
came
he
slammed
a
ball
in
the
gap
between
shortstop
and
second
and
turned
it
into
a
double
but
the
highlight
of
practice
came
when
phillips
cracked
a
line
drive
to
left
that
climbed
and
climbed
until
it
disappeared
over
the
distant
treetops
a
boomer
that
brought
the
vietnamese
to
their
feet
applauding
and
caused
the
americans
to
cheer
rutkowski
changed
the
odds
to
get
more
action
making
the
americans
a
nine
run
favorite
the
north
vietnamese
giants
as
home
team
took
the
field
in
the
top
of
the
inning
after
seeing
the
americans
hit
their
pitcher
was
at
first
shaky
but
he
settled
downnot
however
until
the
americans
had
scored
two
runs

thin
little
man
he
threw
mostly
junk

the
colonel
had
truly
studied
the
game
and
taught
his
wards
well
with
anderson
at
the
plate

down
in

the
third
inning
and
home
in
the
fourth
the
americans
asserted
their
superiority
in
every
phase
of
the
game
so
it
went
until
the
fifth
the
colonel
put
in
a
fresh
pitcher
and
changed
all
but
three
members
of
his
lineup
t
p
who
had
only
a
fastball
and
an
outside
curve
suddenly
faced
batters
who
choked
up
on
their
bats
and
crowded
the
plate
taking
the
outside
edge
of
the
plate
away
from
him
he
walked
two
and
grounded
one
out
the
next
batter
up
hit
a
fly
ball
to
shallow
left
the
american
covering
left
field
charged
in
after
the
ball
but
fell
into
a
hollow
where
he
slammed
to
ground
the
ball
landed
two
feet
away
from
him
and
rolled
to
a
stop
as
the
fielder
was
carried
off
with
a
broken
ankle
t
p
gave
the
next
batter
a
hard
stare
been
for
the
first
five
innings
the
giants
promptly
recorded
seven
hits
and
five
runs
a
bad
inning
but
t
p
got
out
of
it
when
one
of
the
vietnamese
hit
into
a
double
play
and
the
third
baseman
tagged
out
another
who
was
standing
off
base
scratching
his
head
because
he
did
nt
catch
the
colonel
s
signal
to
steal
home
the
sixth
inning
was
no
better
for
t
p
he
let
the
first
two
batters
on
base
with
granny
hits
over
the
second
baseman
anderson
and
tremble
met
on
the
mound
he
s
lost
it
anderson
said
i
can
see
it
tremble
said
hey
guys
those
jokers
got
lucky
hell
they
re
midget
size
got
lucky
tremble
leaned
his
face
into
t
p
s
lucky
you
call
nine
or
ten
hits
in
a
row
lucky
y
er
outta
here
he
said
and
sent
t
p
to
the
outfield
and
brought
in
a
kid
named
schofield
who
threw
three
warm
ups
and
began
firing
bricks
into
anderson
s
up
for
in
power
still
the
vietnamese
pushed
two
runners
home
after
that
the
game
settled
into
a
defensive
battle
for
two
innings
in
the
seventh
one
of
the
vietnamese
dove
after
a
ball
in
the
outfield
and
planted
his
head
in
a
hole
another
missed
catching
a
rifle
shot
drive
at
second
with
his
glove
but
stopped
it
with
his
face
he
lost
three
teeth
candy
made
a
save
in
the
bottom
of
the
seventh
on
a
fly
ball
that
was
heading
out
and
at
the
end
of
eight
the
score
was
even
at
eleven
in
the
top
of
the
eighth
phillips
took
second
on
a
sliding
steal
the
vietnamese
cheered
him
and
several
of
them
ran
up
and
down
the
sidelines
throwing
themselves
to
the
ground
and
sliding
oblivious
to
the
rocks
they
kept
landing
on
thereafter
every
vietnamese
who
ran
the
bases
dropped
to
the
ground
and
slid
in
one
hit
a
home
run
and
slid
into
every
base
he
crossed
including
home
the
americans
shouted
that
was
nt
the
way
went
wild
over
his
performance
in
the
top
of
the
ninth
phillips
hit
a
towering
home
run
that
landed
out
of
sight
in
the
trees
sensibar
stumbled
on
a
rock
and
bruised
his
knee
going
to
second
on
an
easy
double
instead
of
tagging
him
out
the
vietnamese
held
up
play
until
he
was
able
to
stand
then
as
he
limped
about
changing
direction
they
put
him
out
on
a
run
down
play
the
colonel
cheered
from
the
bench
the
americans
were
astonishedthat
also
was
nt
how
the
game
was
played
after
delta
company
scored
three
in
the
top
of
the
ninth
the
colonel
brushing
off
his
hands
crossed
the
field
and
looked
up
at
captain
salazar
it
s
a
wonderful
game
is
nt
it
i
ve
been
thinking
the
one
mistake
americans
make
is
playing
to
win
and
not
for
the
joy
today
we
will
play
until
we
can
play
no
more
but
colonel
that
s
not
how
the
game
is
played
the
colonel
was
speaking
of
baseball
as
a
metaphor
for
life
you
are
surrounded
by
a
girl
and
her
shadow
the
boys
down
on
the
low
quay
know
a
hundred
ways
to
sell
bad
fish
they
ll
mingle
four
dead
eels
with
every
one
alive
knowing
full
well
the
average
man
ca
nt
tell
which
is
which
tangled
inside
a
cloudy
tub
they
ll
polish
up
a
stinking
mackerel
with
a
bit
of
turpentine
and
buff
it
with
their
shirttails
until
it
gleams
beneath
the
wharves
late
in
the
day
you
can
catch
them
blowing
air
into
the
bellies
of
cod
to
make
their
underweight
catch
look
fat
and
succulent
poor
hungry
family
to
puncture
those
flatulent
fish
and
find
them
more
air
than
meat
but
a
boy
s
got
to
make
a
living
and
when
he
is
forced
to
feel
around
in
the
mud
at
low
tide
scrambling
after
sprats
dropped
overboard
from
a
trawler
he
may
have
to
take
a
little
advantage
to
earn
his
daily
wage
you
notice
it
most
on
saturday
nights
when
the
markets
are
set
up
along
low
street
the
orange
sellers
have
secretly
boiled
causes
it
to
turn
black
within
a
day
the
cherry
vendors
have
weighted
their
prepacked
boxes
with
cabbage
leaves
to
tip
the
scales
not
everyone
is
dishonest
but
nearly
every
merchant
prefers
to
sell
his
wares
after
dark
when
their
imperfections
are
softened
by
candlelight
and
men
s
eyes
are
less
discerning
after
a
full
day
s
work
most
workers
are
paid
on
saturday
night
here
in
sunderland
so
they
have
money
in
their
pockets
for
meat
pies
and
jacket
potatoes
kept
warm
in
barrel
ovens
they
buy
two
pennies
worth
of
greasy
herring
and
a
roll
to
go
with
it
the
young
sons
of
public
houseowners
crisscross
the
market
delivering
trays
of
ale
to
wives
who
ve
ordered
it
for
their
family
dinners
and
are
stopped
along
the
way
by
so
many
thirsty
men
they
have
to
run
back
for
more
on
saturday
night
when
the
streets
are
extravagant
with
stacked
purple
cabbages
ruby
apples
bright
green
leeks
fringing
stalls
iridescent
with
oyster
shells
everyone
feels
rich
there
will
be
meat
on
sunday
the
expansive
butcher
holds
out
a
newly
slaughtered
pig
s
heart
like
a
present
it
is
saturday
night
work
is
another
two
days
away
sunday
you
may
play
cards
or
walk
out
on
the
town
moor
or
if
you
are
feeling
guilty
about
something
wash
your
face
and
go
to
church
perhaps
you
ll
just
want
to
sleep
which
is
what
happens
most
sundays
when
you
take
your
tea
on
the
stool
by
the
fire
and
realize
how
good
it
feels
just
to
sit
and
stare
until
your
head
drops
down
upon
your
chest
and
your
cup
slips
from
your
fingers
but
saturday
night
you
are
alive
and
want
some
entertainment
two
new
shows
have
come
to
town
one
is
about
that
disease
everyone
keeps
talking
about
the
cholera
morbus
but
the
second
one
sounds
far
more
promising
the
spectacle
unique
les
chats
savants
signior
capelli
s
celebrated
menagery
of
sagacious
cats
well
known
in
the
principal
cities
of
europe
whose
docility
and
intelligence
never
fail
to
astonish
you
could
certainly
stand
receive
tomorrow
when
you
learn
half
the
plums
you
bought
tonight
are
rotted
through
will
be
decidedly
less
pleasant
you
push
your
way
between
the
stalls
along
low
street
headed
toward
the
theatre
on
sans
on
your
right
the
river
wear
makes
a
snaking
black
ribbon
between
sunderland
proper
and
well
lit
monkwearmouth
on
the
opposite
shore
there
are
fewer
ships
on
the
river
because
of
the
quarantine
you
think
and
it
is
killing
everyone
from
the
keelmen
who
load
newcastle
coal
to
the
potteries
that
need
imported
dorset
clay
your
back
room
matchstick
factory
is
safe
at
least
no
matter
what
happens
for
twenty
years
you
ve
painted
phosphorus
tips
on
little
wooden
splinters
and
you
ve
never
for
a
day
done
without
supplies
the
phosphorus
is
slowly
rotting
your
jawbone
and
turning
you
into
a
freakish
mess
you
ca
nt
bear
to
look
in
the
glass
but
tonight
saturday
night
you
want
only
to
see
some
sagacious
cats
and
not
think
about
how
your
hands
and
face
glow
in
the
dark
get
in
half
priceas
if
life
were
nt
easy
enough
for
them
anyway
you
come
upon
a
stampede
housemaids
leap
squealing
into
coachmen
little
boys
stomp
stomp
stomp
like
indians
in
a
rain
dance
it
s
those
damn
frogs
they
ve
come
up
from
the
riverbed
where
they
ve
been
fucking
and
spawning
fucking
and
spawning
all
this
wet
warm
autumn
until
they
ve
overflowed
the
steep
banks
and
invaded
the
town
merchants
along
low
street
have
found
moist
green
frogs
suffocated
in
their
flour
the
pastor
of
trinity
church
found
them
floating
in
the
communion
wine
just
last
night
your
landlord
cursed
the
chorus
of
frogs
yowling
in
his
basement
and
sent
down
his
ferret
to
rip
through
them
now
it
seems
the
frogs
are
headed
toward
the
nicer
part
of
town
they
are
advancing
on
bishop
wearmouth
the
third
and
by
far
the
most
affluent
section
of
sunderland
built
on
higher
ground
to
the
south
good
you
think
let
a
little
of
the
river
bottom
come
up
in
the
world
like
you
have
on
too
many
nights
that
the
lord
has
sent
a
modern
plague
of
egypt
to
destroy
this
town
how
those
dainty
domestics
and
little
children
carry
on
jabbing
their
umbrellas
at
flailing
rubbery
legs
frightening
the
frogs
far
more
than
they
themselves
are
frightened
you
roll
your
eyes
and
dig
into
your
pocket
for
the
d
they
extort
from
you
at
the
box
office
reach
across
to
hand
the
rouged
ticket
vendor
your
money
but
if
you
please
wait
just
a
moment
before
you
duck
inside
dear
matchstick
painter
and
disappear
from
view
for
what
will
be
at
least
two
hours
we
beg
leave
to
ask
what
might
at
first
seem
a
frivolous
question
but
which
will
eventually
make
sense
if
you
were
to
compose
your
own
story
forgetting
for
also
ashamed
of
the
stubborn
stinginess
that
wo
nt
allow
him
to
feign
the
concern
she
craves
beth
says
it
s
easy
to
make
edna
feel
important
she
is
always
solicitous
toward
his
mother
edna
take
this
chair
she
says
ushering
in
her
new
fragile
body
flashing
beth
one
of
her
not
long
for
this
world
smiles
of
appreciation
his
mother
looks
like
she
s
lost
weight
he
thinks
oddly
wishing
for
one
of
his
own
before
surgery
pictures
for
comparison
she
s
paler
too
of
that
he
s
sure
you
need
to
be
patient
with
her
beth
says
i
ll
get
the
takeout
menus
he
goes
to
the
fireplace
and
sees
the
new
vases
are
made
of
shards
of
old
china
on
one
fragment
there
is
gold
lettering
that
spells

another

he
puts
his

out
of
his

cecil
and
edna
sit
in
her
living
room
with
its
careful
arrangement
of
long
waisted
ballerina
figurines
on
a
distress
finished
table
it
is
edna
s
idea
of
someone
else
s
idea
of
appealing
a
room
like
edna
him
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
pink
art
deco
china
with
a
dull
panic
he
notices
red
pinpoints
on
her
hand
which
he
thinks
he
remembers
are
a
sign
of
a
blood
disease
he
d
like
to
blurt
what
is
your
illness
but
he
sees
that
her
determination
to
keep
it
secret
is
a
perversity
she
treasures
i
hope
beth
will
enjoy
this
set
edna
says
lifting
a
cup
toward
him
she
has
been
sorting
her
belongings
into
teetering
piles
cecil
realizes
that
if
she
were
nt
edna
he
would
see
how
sad
this
is
he
would
feel
pity
oddly
he
could
do
better
then
be
more
patient
and
tolerant
but
pitying
his
mother
even
if
he
could
would
open
some
immense
family
floodgate
that
they
would
all
slip
through
helpless
as
trout
something
fragile
is
maintained
in
his
reserve
i
ve
found
some
things
of
your
father
s
one
is
a
wallet
you
made
for
him
at
summer
camp
he
never
used
it
she
adds
handing
it
back
though
he
has
no
idea
where
it
came
from
when
he
was
ten
edna
taught
him
to
polka
after
first
insisting
he
wash
his
face
and
hands
and
comb
his
hair
now
as
he
remembers
it
it
is
not
just
the
living
room
furniture
that
whirls
by
but
his
growing
up
his
life
the
card
games
she
taught
them
with
complicated
contradictory
rules
salamander
she
d
yell
suddenly
her
bangs
permed
like
poodle
fluff
her
cards
flying
like
bats
turn
your
head
too
she
said
as
they
polkaed
next
time
we
ll
roll
up
the
rug
she
cut
their
hair
in
the
bathtub
then
powdered
them
with
lily
of
the
valley
ted
begged
to
be
spared
the
powder
she
replied
silliest
of
boys
an
animal
s
name
a
billy
goat
a
bear
in
the
polka
s
title
helped
make
it
seem
more
fun
then
the
thread
was
taut
it
dear
she
said
to
his
first
wife
about
a
homemade
skirt
andrea
wore
to
the
library
even
after
she
got
her
neiman
s
charge
the
dance
ending
cecil
rug
burned
an
elbow
in
a
dizzy
fall
stop
that
racket
his
father
yelled
from
the
basement
cecil
supposes
that
was
when
he
discovered
that
accordions
were
embarrassing
and
also
a
little
sad
those
cookies
i
used
to
make
at
christmas
do
you
remember
the
year
you
ate
them
all
and
ted
told
on
you
her
laugh
represents
a
past
she
wants
them
to
have
shared
she
says
ted
s
coming
next
week
she
says
she
killed
a
black
widow
in
the
bathroom
but
her
chatter
only
communicates
one
thing
to
him
her
last
chance
hope
for
his
love
he
wonders
when
he
got
old
enough
that
the
failure
of
this
relationship
became
his
failure
and
no
longer
hers
how
old
was
he
when
she
called
him
cecil
weasel
and
did
nt
he
love
her
then
he
searches
for
a
vanity
where
the
irritations
of
who
she
is
overwhelmed
his
dutiful
affection
when
did
his
soul
become
so
destitute
a
son
who
does
not
love
his
mother
maybe
it
happened
when
he
started
medical
school
and
she
began
to
call
him
doctor
not
because
her
addressing
him
as
doctor
was
pretentious
and
slightly
mortifying
but
because
suddenly
he
was
important
she
adored
him
did
he
reject
her
because
he
guessed
her
love
was
based
more
on
his
status
as
a
future
physician
than
on
who
he
really
was
my
son
the
doctor
or
perhaps
his
failure
came
later
during
his
residency
did
he
despise
edna
because
the
glamorous
speciality
so
delighted
her
my
son
the
plastic
surgeon
did
it
happen
when
he
understood
that
he
did
nt
intend
to
dedicate
his
life
to
transforming
the
ropy
patches
of
burn
victims
did
he
fear
he
d
inherited
her
dubious
ideals
did
cecil
hate
edna
because
her
love
was
after
all
based
precisely
on
who
he
really
was
why
was
nt
she
the
right
he
the
right
kind
of
son
beth
sent
this
over
he
says
remembering
the
fruit
basket
she
had
shoved
into
his
hands
take
credit
for
it
she
had
said
how
thoughtful
she
is
edna
says
she
picks
up
an
apple
rubs
the
skin
to
make
it
squeak
an
apple
for
your
thoughts
she
says
his
frustration
is
so
strong
he
thinks
it
leaves
a
taste
a
taste
dusty
and
sharp
the
bad
flavor
of
a
shriveled
walnut
penny
he
gasps
mom
it
s
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
he
begs
it
as
they
leave
the
examining
room
the
mother
says
you
ll
pay
for
this
in
the
absurd
objective
thinking
of
such
times

sun
the

his

clutching
the

he
pushed
his

back
up
over
the

and
as
they
neared
the

he
said

just
a

to

into

and
the

not

the

passed
through
the

at
upton
otis
looked
down
at
his
lap
where
the
weight
of
his
shotgun
had
begun
to
etch
a
deep
wrinkle
in
hislinen
slacks
well
he
should
have
known
it
all
you
had
to
do
was
look
at
linen
to
make
it
wrinkle
that
was
a
plain
fact
still
a
man
needed
to
have
a
certain
kind
of
style
to
him
when
he
left
the

for
work
its

across
the

and
slipped
them
over

where
a

on

he
let
the

slip
down
inside
the

put
the

on
carefully
then
reflexively
touched

carried

it
off

roman
said
frank
otis
said
right
he
opened
the
car
door
and
touched
his
foot
to
the
street
c
m
on
said
lisa
karras
put
your
arms
up
jimmy
lisa
s
son
raised
his
hands
and
then
dropped
them
as
she
tried
to
fit
the
maroon
and
gold
shirt
over
his
head
he
wiggle
wormed
out
of
the
shirt
giggled
as
he
backed
up
against
a
scarred
playroom
wall
looking
at
him
lisa
laughed
too
there
were
mornings
when
she
would
be
trying
to
get
him
off
to
school
or
get
herself
to
an
appointment
and
jimmy
would
keep
pushing
her
buttons
until
she
d
lose
her
temper
in
a
big
way
but
this
was
not
one
of
those
mornings
jimmy
had
been
out
of
kindergarten
since
june
and
lisa
had
not
picked
up
any
just
a
slow
morning
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
two
of
them
had
nothing
but
time
hey
kiddo
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
some
ice
cream
jimmy
karras
zoomed
over
and
raised
his
arms
lisa
got
the
short
sleeved
redskins
jersey
on
him
before
he
had
a
take
turns
trekking
back
to
the
home
office
keeping
one
foot
in
both
worlds
until
we
could
make
the
jump
south
for
good
in
these
months
i
could
leave
my
daughter
with
her
for
a
week
at
a
time
when
i
called
susan
s
house
on
those
weeklong
trips
it
was
difficult
to
get
sarah
even
to
come
to
the
phone
when
she
did
her
voice
was
filled
with
laughter
and
the
abruptness
that
tells
you
that
your
call
is
an
interruption
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
since
nikki
died
our
daughter
was
a
carefree
child
even
when
susan
s
house
was
burglarized
in
the
late
winter
i
felt
secure
in
her
ability
to
protect
and
care
for
my
daughter
susan
is
seven
years
younger
than
i
a
dark
haired
beauty
and
divorced
she
has
the
fine
features
and
innocent
looks
of
a
child
coupled
with
the
mind
of
a
warrior
for
eight
years
susan
has
been
the
director
of
children
s
protective
services
in
san
diego
an
agency
that
investigates
allegations
of
child
abuse
and
makes
recommendations
to
the
da
regarding
prosecutions
and
to
the
courts
regarding
child
custody
to
call
susan
s
vocation
a
job
is
it
with
the
zeal
of
a
true
believer
children
are
her
life
her
training
is
in
early
childhood
development
where
the
mantra
save
the
kids
has
become
a
battle
cry
we
have
been
seeing
each
other
for
more
than
two
years
though
even
now
in
san
diego
we
do
not
live
together
i
moved
south
to
be
with
her
but
after
some
discussion
we
decided
not
to
move
in
together
at
least
not
yet
when
i
moved
south
some
unstated
law
of
independence
dictated
that
we
maintain
separate
households
it
seems
we
spend
increasing
amounts
of
time
in
each
other
s
company
that
is
when
i
am
not
on
the
road
back
to
capital
city
that
particular
gordian
knot
will
be
cut
as
soon
as
harry
and
i
have
secured
a
sufficient
client
base
in
the
south
which
is
why
today
i
am
renewing
an
old
acquaintance
jonah
and
mary
hale
sit
across
the
desk
from
me
he
has
aged
since
i
saw
him
last
mary
looks
the
same
different
hairdo
but
in
the
before
ben
s
death
and
talia
s
murder
trial
oceans
of
water
under
that
bridge
jonah
was
one
of
my
earliest
cases
in
private
practice
soon
after
i
left
the
da
s
office
where
i
d
cut
my
teeth
the
firm
had
directed
him
down
the
hall
to
the
new
man
in
the
cubicle
at
the
end
at
the
time
jonah
was
just
a
working
stiff
a
married
man
in
his
fifties
with
a
daughter
in
her
late
teens
he
was
getting
ready
to
retire
against
his
will
he
worked
for
the
railroad
in
capital
city
the
locomotive
works
which
was
in
its
death
throes
jonah
had
a
chronic
bad
back
and
knees
thanks
to
years
of
toil
on
hard
concrete
lifting
machine
parts
so
when
the
railroad
was
looking
to
downsize
he
was
an
immediate
candidate
to
go
even
now
he
walks
with
a
cane
though
this
one
is
much
more
ornate
than
the
plain
curved
handled
wooden
stick
i
had
seen
him
with
back
then
the
legs
do
nt
get
any
better
with
into
his
chair
to
find
the
point
of
relative
comfort
but
the
smile
is
as
good
as
ever
i
tell
him
only
because
i
ve
found
an
old
friend
i
only
hope
you
can
help
me
jonah
has
the
good
looks
of
an
aging
hemingway
with
all
the
wrinkles
in
the
right
places
even
with
his
infirmities
he
has
not
put
on
weight
his
tanned
face
is
framed
by
a
shock
of
white
hair
his
beard
is
close
cropped
his
eyes
deep
set
and
gray
he
is
a
rugged
looking
man
well
dressed
with
a
dark
sweater
vest
under
a
cashmere
sport
coat
and
light
colored
slacks
on
his
wrist
is
a
gold
watch
the
size
of
an
oyster
a
rolex
he
could
never
have
afforded
in
the
old
days
i
introduce
him
to
harry
i
ve
heard
a
lot
about
you
says
harry
jonah
just
smiles
he
is
used
to
this
by
now
people
coming
up
slapping
him
on
the
back
cozying
to
get
comes
up
he
tells
harry
everybody
assumes
that
you
had
something
to
do
with
it
well
you
did
buy
the
ticket
says
harry
yes
and
there
have
been
times
when
i
wish
he
had
nt
says
mary
having
money
can
be
its
own
curse
jonah
tells
us
one
senses
that
he
means
what
he
says
jonah
won
the
largest
lottery
payout
in
state
history
million
he
had
purchased
the
ticket
five
years
after
i
d
won
his
case
securing
a
disability
from
the
railroad
that
paid
him
a
year
plus
medical
benefits
for
life
i
could
nt
believe
it
when
i
saw
your
name
in
the
phone
book
i
told
mary
when
i
saw
your
name
it
had
to
be
you
or
your
kid

many
paul
madrianis

of
a
kind

the
mold

jonah
i
do
nt
think

police

you
believe
it
she
s
kidnapped
my
granddaughter
and
the
police
tell
me
it
is
nt
criminal
they
ca
nt
get
involved
kidnapped
i
ask
i
do
nt
know
what
else
to
call
it
for
three
weeks
now
going
on
a
month
i
been
runnin
around
like
a
chicken
without
my
head
going
to
the
police
following
up
with
the
lawyer
we
hired
there
s
another
lawyer
yeah
but
he
ca
nt
do
anything
supposedly
nobody
can
calm
down
tell
me
what
happened
my
granddaughter
amanda
is
eight
years
old
she
s
lived
with
us
mary
and
me
almost
since
the
day
she
was
born
she
and
stepped
back
to
his
table
headed
for
the
door
good
luck
he
called
the
guy
crouched
on
the
floor
nodded
vaguely
and
the
couple
at
the
distant
table
watched
him
go
he
turned
his
collar
up
and
shrugged
down
into
his
coat
and
left
the
opera
behind
him
and
stepped
out
to
the
sidewalk
it
was
dark
and
the
air
was
chill
with
fall
small
haloes
of
fog
were
starting
up
around
the
lights
he
walked
east
to
broadway
and
scanned
through
the
neon
for
the
office
store
it
was
a
narrow
place
packed
with
items
marked
with
prices
on
large
pieces
of
fluorescent
card
cut
in
the
shape
of
stars
everything
was
a
bargain
which
suited
reacher
fine
he
bought
a
small
labeling
machine
and
a
tube
of
superglue
then
he
hunched
back
down
in
his
coat
and
headed
north
to
jodie
s
apartment
his
four
wheel
drive
was
parked
in
the
garage
under
her
building
he
drove
it
up
the
ramp
and
turned
south
on
broadway
and
west
back
to
the
restaurant
he
slowed
on
the
street
and
glanced
halogen
light
on
white
walls
and
pale
wood
no
patrons
every
single
table
was
empty
and
the
owner
was
sitting
on
a
stool
behind
the
bar
reacher
glanced
away
and
came
around
the
block
and
parked
illegally
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
that
ran
down
toward
the
kitchen
doors
he
killed
the
motor
and
the
lights
and
settled
down
to
wait
the
dynamics
of
the
city
the
strong
terrorize
the
weak
they
keep
on
at
it
like
they
always
have
until
they
come
up
against
somebody
stronger
with
some
arbitrary
humane
reason
for
stopping
them
somebody
like
reacher
he
had
no
real
reason
to
help
a
guy
he
hardly
knew
there
was
no
logic
involved
no
agenda
right
then
in
a
city
of
eight
million
souls
there
must
be
hundreds
of
strong
people
hurting
weak
people
maybe
even
thousands
right
then
at
that
exact
moment
he
was
nt
going
to
seek
them
all
out
he
was
nt
mounting
any
kind
of
a
big
campaign
but
equally
he
was
nt
about
could
nt
just
walk
away
he
never
had
he
fumbled
the
label
machine
out
of
his
pocket
scaring
the
two
guys
away
was
only
half
the
job
what
mattered
was
who
they
thought
was
doing
the
scaring
a
concerned
citizen
standing
up
alone
for
some
restaurant
owner
s
rights
was
going
to
cut
no
ice
at
all
no
matter
how
effective
that
concerned
citizen
might
be
at
the
outset
nobody
is
afraid
of
a
lone
individual
because
a
lone
individual
can
be
overwhelmed
by
sheer
numbers
and
anyway
sooner
or
later
a
lone
individual
dies
or
moves
away
or
loses
interest
what
makes
a
big
impression
is
an
organization
he
smiled
and
looked
down
at
the
machine
and
started
to
figure
out
how
it
worked
he
printed
his
own
name
as
a
test
and
pinched
the
tape
off
and
inspected
it
reacher
seven
letters
punched
through
in
white
on
a
blue
plastic
ribbon
a
hair
over
an
inch
long
that
was
going
to
make
the
first
guy
s
label
about
five
inches
long
and
the
second
guy
ideal
he
smiled
again
and
clicked
and
printed
and
laid
the
finished
ribbons
on
the
seat
next
to
him
they
had
adhesive
on
the
back
under
a
peel
off
paper
strip
but
he
needed
something
better
than
that
which
is
why
he
had
bought
the
superglue
he
unscrewed
the
cap
off
the
tiny
tube
and
pierced
the
metal
foil
with
the
plastic
spike
and
filled
the
nozzle
ready
for
action
he
put
the
cap
back
on
and
dropped
the
tube
and
the
labels
into
his
pocket
then
he
got
out
of
the
car
into
the
chill
air
and
stood
in
the
shadows
waiting
the
dynamics
of
the
city
his
mother
had
been
scared
of
cities
it
had
been
part
of
his
education
she
had
told
him
cities
are
dangerous
places
they
re
full
of
tough
scary
guys
he
was
a
tough
boy
himself
but
he
had
walked
around
as
a
teenager
ready
and
willing
to
believe
her
and
he
had
seen
that
she
was
right
people
on
city
streets
were
fearful
crossed
to
the
opposite
sidewalk
to
avoid
coming
near
him
they
made
it
so
obvious
he
became
convinced
the
scary
guys
were
always
right
behind
him
at
his
shoulder
then
he
suddenly
realized
no
i
m
the
scary
guy
they
re
scared
of
me
it
was
a
revelation
he
saw
himself
reflected
in
store
windows
and
understood
how
it
could
happen
he
had
stopped
growing
at
fifteen
when
he
was
already
six
feet
five
and
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
giant
like
most
teenagers
in
those
days
he
was
dressed
like
a
bum
the
caution
his
mother
had
drummed
into
him
was
showing
up
in
his
face
as
a
blank
eyed
impassive
stare
they
re
scared
of
me
it
amused
him
and
he
smiled
and
then
people
stayed
even
farther
away
from
that
point
onward
he
knew
cities
were
just
the
same
as
every
other
place
and
for
every
city
person
he
needed
to
be
scared
of
there
were
nine
hundred
and
ninety
nine
others
a
lot
more
scared
of
him
he
used
the
knowledge
in
his
walk
and
his
gaze
redoubled
the
effect
he
had
on
people
the
dynamics
of
the
city
fifty
five
minutes
into
the
hour
he
moved
out
of
the
shadows
and
stood
on
the
corner
leaning
back
against
the
brick
wall
of
the
restaurant
building
still
waiting
he
could
hear
the
opera
just
a
faint
breath
of
sound
coming
through
the
glass
next
to
him
the
traffic
thumped
and
banged
through
potholes
on
the
street
there
was
a
bar
on
the
opposite
corner
with
an
extractor
roaring
and
steam
drifting
outward
through
the
neon
glare
it
was
cold
and
the
people
on
the
sidewalk
were
hurrying
past
with
their
faces
ducked
deep
into
scarves
he
kept
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
leaned
i
was
there
i
it
was
windy
out
a
hot
breeze
was
rustling
through
the
tall
pecan
trees
in
the
vacant
lot
behind
the
bus
stop
and
a
naughty
by
nature
tune
was
blaring
from
the
open
window
of
perry
s
and
beer
joint
across
the
street
the
small
aluminum
sided
building
was
vibrating
from
the
beat
whatcha
looking
at
i
asked
even
friendlier
than
the
first
time
my
bracelet
the
girl
said
in
a
soft
voice
my
bracelet
it
slipped
off
and
fell
down
there
i
leaned
in
closely
and
peered
into
the
rectangular
shaped
hole
but
all
i
could
make
out
in
the
darkness
was
a
white
plastic
cup
and
some
pages
of
a
crumpled
old
newspaper
i
do
nt
see
nothing
i
said
it
s
in
there
she
said
i

nt
really

down
there
i
saw
something
moving
around
it
s
a
rat
i
told
myself
a
big
hairy
rat
with
red
eyes
and
yellow
teeth
there
were
plenty
of
them
in
the
bottom
big
shaggy
monsters
that
lived
in
the
walls
of
our
tiny
rent
shacks
underneath
our
porches
and
of
course
in
the
rain
gutters
that
lined
our
littered
streets
i
ai
nt
sticking
my
hands
down
in
there
girl

must
be
crazy
i
yelled
the
girl
did
nt
even
look
my
way
she
got
down
on
all
fours
and
shoved
her
thin
hand
into
the
drain
as
she
leaned
into
the
hole
her
dress
hiked
up
exposing
her
underwear
her
yellow
panties
were
shabby
and
ripped
in
several
places
the
elastic
was
loose
and
hanging
halfway
down
her
bony
thighs
she
was
wearing
worse
than
hand
me
downs
she
was
wearing
worn
outs
let
me
get
your
bracelet
i
said
my
arms
are
longer
than
yours
i
got
down
on
all
into
the
gutter
and
fished
around
in
the
trash
until
i
felt
something
round
it
had
to
be
the
bracelet
i
pulled
it
out
and
stood
up
it
was
plastic
transparent
and
purple
you
could
buy
a
dozen
like
it
for
a
buck
in
any
dime
store
on
main
in
downtown
houston
i
handed
it
to
her
with
a
scowl
on
my
face
she
snatched
it
and
held
it
up
to
her
breast
like
it
was
a
new
dress
or
something
thanks
she
said
with
a
big
grin
i
woulda
been
really
upset
if
i
could
nt
of
got
it
it
s
just
an
old
plastic
bracelet
i
snapped

nothing

nt

anywhere
it
s
a
magic
bracelet
the
girl
said
when
i
hold
it
up
in
the
moonlight
i
become
so
tiny
that
only
the
ants
can
see
me
when
the
wind
blows
real
hard
wonderful
beautiful
place
to
land
with
that
the
girl
slipped
the
bracelet
over
her
wrist
and
stepped
up
on
the
curb
i
got
ta

m
gon

i
called
after
her
kambia
her
voice
trailed
i
m
kambia
i
stood
there
in
the
street
and
watched
her
skinny
body
stepping
lightly
over
the
dirty
sidewalks
there
was
something
that
bothered
me
about
that
girl
and
her
silly
magic
bracelet
i
just
could
nt
imagine
anybody
showing
underwear
like
that
for
a
ten
cent
toy
it
was
way
too
weird
she
was
way
too
weird
i
stepped
up
on
the
curb
weeks
there
had
been
nothing
but
rain
buckets
of
it
pouring
out
of
the
gray
sky
overflowing
our
gutters
and
flooding
our
streets
but
last
night
the
rain
stopped
and
this
morning
the
sun
was
shining
bright
over
our
houses
reclaiming
its
place
among
the
clouds
it
looked
like
it
was
gon
na
be
a
nice
day
that
is
until
mama
got
a
visit
from
miss

a
few
blocks
up
the
street
she
is
a
mean
spirited
sour
faced
woman
with
pop
eyes
and
a
huge
belly
that
hangs
over
her
thin
legs
like
an
oversized
water
balloon
the
children
in
the
neighborhood
call
her
frog
frog
came
raging
up
our
porch
steps
around
noon
she
had
a
look
that
would
have
turned
the
devil
into
a
christian
and
she
was
throwing
hell
all
over
the
place
with
each
step
mama
stopped
sweeping
the
living
room
floor
she
opened
the
screen
door
and
stepped
outside
with
her
broom
in
her
hand
i
followed
her
out

tugging
the

of

her
free
hand

been
doing

all

and
her
dress
was
drenched
with

and
clinging
to

asked

real
calm
and
controlled
but
you
could
see
just
a
hint
of

pushing
up
through
the
ebony
of
her
cheekbones
that
little
butt
wiggling
leg
spreading

to
us
i
ve
got
to
go
home
to
my
boys
rosita
cried
luke
could
hear
the
note
of
hysteria
in
rosita
s
voice
the
poor
kid
is
scared
stiff
he
thought
just
a
few
years
younger
than
regan
and
supporting
two
children
on
her
own
help
her
to
grasp
rosita
s
arm
as
fearfully
she
stepped
down
onto
the
deck
of
the
swaying
vessel
you
re
very
good
at
influencing
people
mr
reilly
c
b
complimented
let
s
hope
you
re
as
successful
for
the
next
twenty
four
hours
petey
unlocked
the
door
of
the
cabin
and
pushed
it
open
releasing
a
dank
musty
smell
into
the
cold
outside
air
whew
petey
said
that
stink
ll
get
you
every
time
move
it
petey
c
b
ordered
i
told
you
to
get
an
airwick
how
thoughtful
rosita
said
sarcastically
as
she
followed
petey
inside
luke
glanced
over
at
the
manhattan
skyline
then
looked
upriver
to
the
george
washington
bridge
taking
in
the
little
red
lighthouse
underneath
i
wonder
if
i
ll
ever
get
the
chance
to
see
all
this
again
he
thought
as
c
b
pressed
the
gun
in
the
small
of
his
back
inside
mr
reilly
this
is
nt
the
overhead
light
as
c
b
closed
the
door
behind
them
on
one
side
of
the
small
shabby
space
was
a
seating
area
consisting
of
a
formica
dinette
table
surrounded
by
a
cracked
imitation
leather
banquette
directly
opposite
was
a
matching
couch
the
furniture
was
all
built
in
units
a
small
refrigerator
sink
and
stove
were
adjacent
to
the
table
luke
knew
that
the
two
doors
to
the
left
probably
led
to
a
bedroom
and
whatever
passed
for
a
bathroom
oh
no
rosita
gasped
luke
followed
her
stare
and
with
dismay
realized
that
two
sets
of
chains
were
bolted
to
the
walls
in
the
seating
area
they
were
the
kind
of
hand
and
ankle
restraints
commonly
used
to
restrain
criminal
defendants
in
courtrooms
one
set
was
next
to
the
couch
the
other
near
the
banquette
you
sit
here
petey
directed
rosita
keep
me
covered
c
b
while
i
put
her
bracelets
on
i
got
everybody
covered
c
b
said
emphatically
you
re
over
i
d
take
my
chances
and
try
to
grab
his
gun
luke
thought
angrily
but
i
ca
nt
risk
rosita
s
life
an
instant
later
he
was
sitting
on
the
banquette
chained
with
rosita
opposite
him
on
the
couch
i
should
have
asked
if
either
one
of
you
cares
to
use
the
facilities
but
now
you
ll
just
have
to
wait
c
b
said
cheerfully
i
do
nt
want
to
be
late
for
my
uncle

funeral
after
all
i

the
chief
mourner
and

for
my
meal
today
remember
mr
reilly
c
b
opened
the
door
as
petey
turned
out
the
light
an
instant
later
the
door
slammed
shut
and
luke
and
rosita
could
hear
the
grating
of
the
key
turning
in
the
rusty
lock
trapped
in
the
shadowy
darkness
of
the
swaying
boat
of
their
precarious
situation
hit
both
of
them
then
rosita
asked
quietly
mr
reilly
what
s
going
to
happen
to
us
luke
chose
his
words
carefully
they
ve
already
told
us
they
re
looking
for
money
assuming
that
s
all
they
really
want
i
promise
it
will
be
paid
all
i
can
think
about
is
my
kids
my
regular
baby
sitter
is
away
until
next
week
and
i

nt
trust
the
girl
who

filling
in
her
christmas
dance

nt
want

but
i
begged
her
to
she

she
would
nt
leave
the
boys
alone
you
do
nt
know
her
mr
reilly
she
wo
nt
miss
that
dance
rosita
said
with
certainty
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
ve
got
to
get
home
i
ve
just
got
to
get
home
regan
opened
her
eyes
groggily
sat
up
swung
her
legs
over
the
in
her
parents
apartment
on
central
park
south
was
as
comfortably
familiar
as
the
one
in
the
family
home
in
new
jersey
in
which
she
d
been
raised
today
though
she
did
not
take
time
to
appreciate
the
charming
ambience
of
the
peach
and
soft
green
color
scheme
she
had
the
sensation
of
having
slept
a
long
time
but
when
she
looked
at
the
clock
she
was
glad
to
see
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
before
two
she
wanted
to
phone
the
hospital
and
see
how
her
mother
was
doing
then
catch
up
with
her
father
she
realized
that
beyond
the
fact
that
she
was
feeling
the
effects
of
the
news
about
her
mother
s
accident
and
the
hurried
red
eye
flight
she
was
filled
with
undefined
anxiety
a
quick
shower
might
help
me
clear
my
mind
she
thought
and
then
i
ll
get
moving
she
put
in
a
call
to
la
parisienne
the
local
coffee
shop
and
placed
her
usual
breakfast
order
orange
juice
coffee
and
a
toasted
bagel
with
cream
cheese
thought
by
the
time
i
get
out
of
the
shower
the
delivery
boy
will
be
ringing
the
bell
the
strong
spray
of
hot
water
felt
good
on
her
back
and
shoulders
she
quickly
washed
her
hair
stepped
out
of
the
shower
wrapped
herself
in
a
robe
and
rolled
a
towel
around
her
head
ten
seconds
later
her
face
glistening
with
moisturizer
she
answered
the
door
for
the
delivery
boy
she
was
glad
he
pretended
not
to
notice
her
appearance
in
his
job
he
s
seen
it
all
she
thought
but
he
did
produce
a
sunny
smile
when
she
gave
him
a
generous
tip
moments
later
the
bagel
unwrapped
the
coffee
cup
in
her
hand
she
phoned
her
mother
s
room
she
knew
the
days
mr
fairgrieve
did
not
flinch
st
mary
s
is
an
orphanage
then
susannah
nodded
as
well
as
a
school
and
a
hospital
he
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
absorbing
what
she
had
said
and
you
he
asked
finally
me
she
replied
confused
how
did
you
wind
up
there
at
this
school
i
i
was
raised
there
she
looked
down
at
the
baby
and
rocked
just
a
little
faster
in
the
sturdy
wooden
chair
speckles
of
sun
washed
dust
twinkled
in
the
air
one
of
those
children
you
read
about
in
penny
dreadfuls
left
on
the
doorstep
in
a
basket
except
that
i
was
in
an
old
fruit
box
i
m
sorry
she
bristled
slightly
although
there
had
been
a
note
of
gruff
kindness
in
his
voice
do
nt
be
i
was
very
happy
at
st
mary
s
the
nuns
were
good
to
me
and
i
was
given
an
education
of
sorts
you
never
married
it
might
have
been
either
a
question
or
a
statement
he
spared
so
little
inflection
for
the
words
susannah
felt
the
old
hollowness
inside
and
quelled
it
quickly
the
baby
was
asleep
now
sweet
and
sated
no
she
said
softly
and
at
some
length
i
worked
as
a
companion
after
i
left
school
and
there
never
seemed
heavily
shoved
a
hand
through
his
lustrous
hair
until
you
left
your
work
to
come
here
to
seattle
susannah
wanted
to
weep
though
she
did
not
allow
herself
that
release
fearing
she
might
never
stop
crying
i
felt
i
could
do
nothing
else
julia
s
letters
i
can
well
imagine
julia
s
letters
he
said
wearily
and
with
some
disgust
he
spread
his
hands
started
to
say
something
else
and
bit
back
the
words
i
wo
nt
be
a
burden
mr
fairgrieve
susannah
said
perhaps
too
quickly
she
was
a
proud
woman
but
she
was
prepared
to
beg
if
that
was
what
she
had
to
do
i
can
give
music
lessons
if
you
will
allow
me
the
use
of
julia
s
piano
and
of
course
i
will
pay
room
and
board
all
this
he
asked
rising
to
his
feet
for
a
stranger
s
child
julia
was
not
a
aubrey
answered
i
do
nt
suppose
she
was
to
you
but
i
am
he
paused
are
nt
you
afraid
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
the
sort
of
monster
julia
must
have
made
me
out
to
be
she
met
his
fierce
gaze
held
it
i
can
look
after
myself
she
said
evenly
my
concern
is
for
this
baby
i
d
like
to
call
her
victoria
if
you
do
nt
mind
she
should
have
a
name
call
her
whatever
you
like
aubrey
replied
his
voice
cool
poor
julia
susannah
muttered
aloud
quite
inadvertently
fairgrieve
leaned
forward
until
his
nose
was
barely
an
inch
from
susannah
s
poor
julia
he
replied
with
quiet
mockery
god
rest
her
soul
cared
for
nothing
and
no
one
but
herself
her
greatest
worry
where
this
child
was
concerned
was
that
the
pregnancy
might
spoil
her
figure
therefore
whatever
you
do
please
do
wife
susannah
blinked
shocked
by
the
cold
fury
of
such
a
reply
yes
she
d
known
that
julia
was
nt
happy
in
the
marriage
at
least
not
in
its
latter
days
but
even
then
she
had
never
guessed
that
the
situation
had
deteriorated
into
such
bitterness
and
rancor
as
mr
fairgrieve
was
displaying
now
i
do
not
wish
to
argue
the
quality
of
my
friend
s
character
with
you
or
anyone
else
she
said
but
julia
looked
forward
to
the
birth
and
she
loved
you
very
much
at
least
in
the
beginning
i
know
that
from
her
letters
fairgrieve
s
expression
was
one
of
exasperated
contempt
and
for
all
that
he
was
still
very
attractive
a
contradiction
that
unsettled
susannah
to
no
small
degree
julia
would
nt
have
known
love
from
the
grocer
s
lame
horse
he
snapped
from
the
moment
she
knew
she
was
pregnant
she
bewailed
her
fate
and
cursed
me
for
a
rutting
bull
with
no
concern
for
her
huffing
breath
as
though
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
susannah
s
eyes
widened
as
his
implication
struck
home
but
she
refused
to
honor
such
a
suggestion
with
a
response
like
everyone
else
julia
had
not
been
perfect
she
had
been
quite
shallow
in
some
ways
and
she
could
be
childish
and
petulant
at
times
but
she
had
many
good
qualities
as
well
if
aubrey
fairgrieve
had
been
her
husband
then
he
was
without
question
the
father
of
this
child
and
that
as
far
as
susannah
was
concerned
decided
the
matter
we
seem
to
be
thinking
of
two
different
women
she
said
in
a
reflective
tone
you
knew
one
julia
and
i
knew
another
apparently
he
ground
out
she
held
the
child
just
a
little
tighter
and
she
saw
in
his
eyes
that
he
understood
the
gesture
for
what
it
was
a
declaration
she
was
laying
claim
to
a
place
a
prominent
place
in
this
baby
s
to
the
idea
of
surrender
in
any
shape
or
guise
julia
had
been
at
least
partially
correct
it
appeared
in
her
bitter
assessment
of
her
husband
s
nature
he
was
bone
stubborn
a
man
who
liked
getting
his
own
way
he
glared
at
her
for
a
long
moment
without
another
word
and
then
turned
and
left
the
kitchen
susannah
lingered
in
the
chair
for
a
while
thinking
and
then
went
back
upstairs
laid
the
baby
carefully
on
her
bed
securing
her
on
either
side
with
pillows
that
done
she
fashioned
a
cradle
from
one
of
the
bureau
drawers
padding
the
bottom
with
a
folded
blanket
and
the
sides
with
rolled
towels
no
doubt
there
was
a
nursery
somewhere
in
the
house
but
for
now
this
arrangement
would
do
after
moving
a
soundly
sleeping
victoria
to
the
improvised
crib
she
ventured
out
long
enough
to
locate
the
splendid
bathing
room
julia
had
written
her
about
took
a
hasty
bath
in
the
giant
copper
tub
with
its
tank
of
hot
water
a
hook
on

entibor
an

sus

on

world
not

in
a
life
he
had
never
anticipated
arekhon
sus
khalgath
sus
peledaen
sleptand
sleeping
dreamed
in
his
dream
he
knelt
in
the
meditation
chamber
of
the
starship
toolong
where
he
had
not
gone
in
his
waking
body
for
over
a
dozen
years
his
staff
a
cubit
and
a
half
of
black
wood
bound
with
silver
lay
on
the
deck
in
front
of
him
and
all
around
him
the
daughter
vibrated
with
the
urgency
of
her
passage
through
the
void
arekhon
wondered
what
he
was
meant
to
do
had
he
only
now
begun
his
meditation
here
inside
his
dream
or
had
he
just
ended
it
he
could
nt
remember
but
somewhere
outside
the
chamber
an
alarm
began
to
sound
he
picked
up
his
staff
in
his
right
hand
and
got
to
his
feet
outside
the
chamber
the
alarm
bell
continued
its
steady
pulse
note
chime
he
found
the
door
and
opened
it
and
stepped
throughnot
but
into
the
old
hall
at
demaizen
and
the
warm
golden
light
of
an
autumn
afternoon
garrod
syn
aigal
sus
demaizengreat
magelord
void
walker
and
finder
of

taken
the
land
and
fortune
that
were
his
inheritance
and
had
used
them
to
build
a
circle
strong
enough
and
dedicated
enough
to
carry
out
the
greatest
of
great
workings
to
bring
together
the
two
parts
of
the
sundered
galaxy
crossing
the
interstellar
gap
and
healing
a
rift
that
had
existed
since
the
unimaginably
long
ago
arekhon
had
left
the
sus
peledaen
fleet
and
his
family
altars
to
become
a
part
of
lord
garrod
scircle
and
when
the
working
demanded
it
of
him
he
had
left
his
native
world
as
well
he
had
walked
through
the
old
hall
in
dreams
often
enough
since
then
in
the
years
after
the
demaizen
mage
circle
had
split
apart
in
fire
and
blood
but
never
as
now
with
the
weight
of
knowledge
bearing
down
hard
upon
him
in
these
rooms
he
had
grown
from
a
sus
peledaen
fleet
apprentice
with
a
knack
for
seeing
the
eiran
and
making
luck
now
he
came
back
to
them
with
the
sound
of
the
daughter
s
alarm
bell
following
him
wherever
he
went
sometimes
in
his
dreams
he
saw
the
mages
of
demaizen
as
he
had
known
them
before
on
those
nights
he
sparred
with
delath
or
serazao
in
the
long
gallery
or
talked
of
space
and
stars
with
kiefen
diasul
though
in
the
waking
world
both
del
and
zao
were
dead
and
kief
had
betrayed
all
of
them
years
ago
tonight
though
was
different
instead
of
delath
or
serazao
the
dream
gave
him
iulan
vai
vaithe
last
come
member
of
the
circle
who
had
brought
too
long
from
her
employers
the
sus
radal
to
save
the
demaizen
mages
from
utter
destruction
and
who
had
stayed
behind
on
eraasi
in
order
to
repay
the
debt
arekhon
found
her
in
the
long
gallery
with
its
tall
westward
facing
windows
and
its
racks
of
exercise
mats
and
limber
practice
staves
she
had
nt
altered
her
appearance
since
the
last
time
he
saw
her
in
the
flesh
under
the
touch
with
rusty
brown
highlights
and
she
still
clothed
her
compact
frame
in
tunic
and
leggings
of
ordinary
black
iule
he
saidthough
she
had
always
refused
the
forms
of
affection
even
with
those
who
might
have
had
a
claim
to
use
them
what
are
you
doing
here
looking
for
you
did
you
think
you
could
go
away
forever
i
did
nt
think
i
had
a
choice
you
did
nt
she
told
him
not
then
but
everything
changes
and
we
have
to
change
with
it
as
she
spoke
the
light
from
the
westering
sun
struck
the
windowpanes
at
a
new
and
sudden
angle
dazzling
his
eyes
for
a
moment
when
the
glare
died
he
was
nt
seeing
iulan
vai
any
longer
another
woman
looked
at
him
in
her
place
an
older
woman
whose
thick
black
hair
was
shot
through
with
wide
streaks
of
iron
grey
and
whose
skin
was
the
color
of
burnished
copper
not
vai
though
like
staff
and
not
anyone
else
he
recognized
do
i
know
you
he
asked
her
not
yet
she
said
but
soon
outside
the
long
gallery
somewhere
in
the
roomsand
the
lifethat
he
had
left
behind
him
the
sound
of
the
daughter
s
alarm
changed
from
a
bell
note
to
a
strident
metallic
wail
you
have
to
leave
now
it
s
almost
time
natelth
sus
khalgath
sus
peledaen
stood
with
his
back
to
the
observation
deck
of
his
orbiting
shipyard
and
stronghold
his
face
only
a
few
inches
from
the
armored
glass
that
gave
the
deck
its
name
the
world
of
eraasi
lay
before
him
a
great
globe
against
the
starfield
black
in
the
vacuum
of
space
stars
glittering
all
around
it
the
sunset
line
lay
across
the
world
on
the
left
as
he
looked
at
it
the
darkened
crescent
alive
with
city
lights
he
knew
that
elsewhere
hidden
beyond
the
bulk
of
the
planet
the
citadel
of
the
sus
radal
fleet
family
circled
but
natelth
secure
in
his
own
place
hardly
thought
of
the
sus
radal
he
led
and
the
other
star
lords
followed
and
if
he
started
hopping
on
one
foot
before
long
theledau
sus
radal
would
be
bouncing
around
on
his
head
natelth
heard
the
swish
click
of
the
doubled
inner
airlocks
that
isolated
the
observation
deck
from
the
rest
of
the
station
but
he
did
nt
turn
he
would
have
known
who
was
approaching
him
even
if
the
armored
glass
had
not
shown
him
her
reflected
image
his
sister
isayana
joining
him
in
the
safety
of
exile
from
the
planet
s
surface
had
come
bearing
news
he
hated
living
on
the
orbiting
station
he
watched
isayana
s
reflection
approaching
not
a
twin
of
his
own
but
close
enough
that
he
and
she
had
often
been
mistaken
for
such
when
both
were
young
the
same
square
frame
and
strong
features
the
same
black
hair
now
going
grey
hostess
i
thought
we
might
go
riding
like
old
times
nick
wore
no
emotion
i
ca
nt
sheridan
i
m
working
you
call
that
work
she
laughed
besides
you
re
the
boss
you
set
your
own
hours
sorry
i
ll
have
to
take
a
rain
check
their
gazes
locked
billie
felt
like
an
intruder
finally
sheridan
dismounted
and
handed
over
her
horse
to
a
waiting
groom
she
left
without
comment
although
billie
sensed
her
anger
boiling
inside
billie
looked
at
nick
and
noted
the
strange
twist
to
his
lips
are
you
laughing
at
me
this
is
called
a
grimace
nick
demonstrated
while
he
talked
let
s
start
with
the
basics
now
this
is
a
saddle
billie
he
was
taking
up
his
valuable
time
no
telling
what
was
going
on
back
at
the
house
and
seeing
sheridan
again
after
all
these
months
had
left
him
shaken
he
had
enough
problems
and
billie
pearce
was
only
adding
to
them
this
is
a
stirrup
mr
kaharchek
pay
attention
now
you
slide
it
up
snug
against
the
saddle
like
this
this
is
a
girth
you
unhitch
the
girth
and
the
saddle
slides
off
you
can
take
the
saddle
pads
off
the
horse
at
the
same
time
he
motioned
for
a
stable
hand
lurking
just
inside
the
barn
from
the
look
on
the
kid
s
face
bafflement
and
amusement
he
d
witnessed
the
whole
thing
nick
avoided
eye
contact
instead
he
handed
the
saddle
to
the
youth
and
in
turn
took
a
blue
nylon
halter
from
him
he
pulled
billie
toward
zeke
s
head
always
leave
the
reins
over
the
horse
s
neck
while
you
re
removing
the
bridle
he
placed
her
hand
behind
zeke
s
crown
piece
you
gently
slide
it
over
the
horse
s
ears
and
he
paused
when
billie
s
face
suddenly
registered
pain
her
face
went
white
something
wrong
he
sonmyfoot
the
dumb
son
of
a
horse
is
on
my
foot
she
tried
to
shove
zeke
but
it
was
like
trying
to
move
mount
everest
tears
smarted
her
eyes
nick
reacted
quickly
one
firm
touch
and
the
big
chestnut
gelding
calmly
shifted
away
from
billie
she
stared
wide
eyed
at
her
brand
new
riding
boot
perfectly
branded
with
the
imprint
of
zeke
s
hoof
she
gasped
in
pain
my
foot
is
broken
it
s
probably
shattered
she
glared
at
the
horse
was
she
just
imagining
the
smug
expression
she
d
seen
that
same
look
on
sheridan
flock
s
face
you
did
that
on
purpose
she
accused
she
shot
a
glance
at
nick
he
obviously
finds
it
amusing
nick
had
to
agree
it
did
look
as
though
zeke
were
smiling
i
ll
signaled
for
the
hovering
boy
to
take
zeke
away
and
brush
him
down
before
putting
him
into
his
stall
that
s
not
a
damn
bit
funny
billie
said
as
she
watched
the
horse
walk
away
with
a
jaunty
sway
of
its
hips
if
body
language
was
anything
to
go
by
the
animal
clearly
thought
it
was
the
victor
in
their
little
encounter
as
for
her
jaunty
swaying
was
out
of
the
question
she
could
nt
put
any
weight
on
her
foot
i
ll
never
walk
again
she
wailed
mrs
pearce
please
calm
down
nick
sighed
just
when
he
thought
things
could
nt
get
worse
the
woman
was
really
hurt
she
d
probably
managed
not
to
sign
a
release
form
and
would
likely
sue
the
pants
off
him
his
insurance
company
would
cancel
his
polo
school
would
be
history
and
she
was
hurt
that
was
the
worst
part
his
protective
instincts
snapped
alive
her
pretty
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
she
refused
to
shed
belligerent
set
to
her
chin
and
decided
she
probably
was
brave
even
if
it
did
nt
look
that
way
at
the
moment
he
scooped
her
into
his
arms
and
turned
toward
the
barn
her
mouth
popped
open
in
surprise
but
he
felt
her
arms
circle
around
his
neck
as
though
she
realized
she
had
no
choice
she
pressed
against
him
for
support
just
what
he
needed
after
having
her
fall
full
length
against
him
coming
in
contact
with
him
in
all
the
right
places
he
envisioned
her
children
and
their
friends
coming
home
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
the
smell
of
homemade
cookies
and
tall
glasses
of
milk
he
envied
them
wondered
if
they
realized
how
lucky
they
were
having
been
raised
by
one
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
powerful
families
in
the
state
he
d
had
little
opportunity
for
warm
straight
out
of
the
oven
cookies
and
cold
milk
billie
shifted
and
the
soft
material
of
her
tank
top
brushed
against
his
bare
arms
she
felt
soft
and
curvy
and
feminine
a
nice
contrast
never
be
thin
enough
he
owed
zeke
a
nice
red
apple
damn
he
had
no
business
thinking
how
soft
and
warm
billie
pearce
was
she
had
room
mother
and
pta
spokesperson
written
all
over
her
pretty
face
she
would
never
consider
a
three
day
weekend
filled
with
sun
fun
and
great
sex
she
was
different
and
she
would
nt
appreciate
knowing
he
was
aroused
just
thinking
about
her
inside
the
barn
nick
plunked
her
down
on
a
bench
how
does
it
feel
smushed
smushed
lord
she
was
talking
like
her
sixth
graders
how
do
you
think
it
feels
she
snapped
it
feels
like
a
horse
crushed
it
to
smithereens
we
have
to
get
the
boot
off
oh
no
you
do
nt
not
without
ordering
me
a
morphine
drip
he
almost
smiled
mrs
pearce
i
need
to
examine
your
foot
that
means
i
have
to
pull
off
the
boot
me
drawn
and
quartered
billie
sucked
in
her
breath
and
gripped
the
bench
as
he
gingerly
worked
the
boot
off
her
injured
foot
she
closed
her
eyes
trying
to
remember
the
breathing
techniques
she
d
learned
in
lamaze
class
years
before
as
she
prepared
for
labor
and
delivery
when
her
children
were
born
she
took
a
deep
cleansing
breath
and
concentrated
on
the
top
of
nick
s
head
she
wanted
to
touch
domineering
moods
she
knew
how
to
get
around
him
just
laugh
at
him
when
he
got
into
one
of
his
conniptions
but
he
always
scared
me
green
even
though
i
knew
he
would
nt
do
nothing
but
fuss
he
s
never
even
threatened
to
fire
me
judge
could
say
the
most
cruel
things
though
you
d
do
anything
to
make
him
stop
she
stared
at
the
old
man
in
the
chair
searching
for
some
trace
of
the
bearlike
tyrant
he
had
once
been
judge
can
be
funny
when
he
wants
to
be
people
used
to
say
he
was
more
like
andy
griffith
than
andy
hisself
but
he
has
a
side
to
him
too
sometimes
i
felt
about
eight
years
old
when
i
was
around
judge
and
i
used
to
wonder
if
that
would
have
changed
if
i
d
had
an
education
and
an
outside
job
to
make
money
that
did
nt
come
from
him
it
s
hard
to
say
well
he
was
my
boss
and
i
let
him
have
the
last
word
every
time
that
s
for
sure
and
you
know
i
could
never
imagine
him
losing
that
power
i
never
could
picture
judge
old
and
weak
wasting
away
i
always
thought
he
d
just
keel
over
one
day
from
sheer
rage
you
know
caught
behind
a
farm
truck
on
the
no
passing
stretch
of
route
oh
he
hates
slow
drivers
i
thought
one
day
judge
would
boil
over
in
fury
and
burst
an
artery
and
it
would
all
be
over
in
two
seconds
one
minute
he
d
be
his
fierce
old
self
and
the
next
minute
he
d
be
gone
instantaneous
darkness
like
a
power
outage
in
a
thunderstorm
that
is
the
one
thing
about
judge
i
was
sure
of
nora
bonesteel
nodded
but
she
was
still
looking
out
at
the
old
man
in
the
lawn
chair
she
had
never
seen
the
tyrannical
side
of
john
walker
but
then
she
did
nt
have
to
live
with
him
the
dark
side
of
mountain
politeness
is
that
an
angry
man
sometimes
swallows
his
rage
against
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
she
d
known
of
more
than
one
genial
and
witty
man
who
was
a
terror
in
private
whatever
john
walker
s
anger
had
been
about
it
was
gone
now
all
that
was
left
was
the
mccourry
indifference
the
hunkering
down
into
the
sufficiency
of
self
that
was
the
mccourrys
strength
and
their
refuge
and
ultimately
the
source
of
their
loneliness
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
to
change
that
and
even
if
she
could
it
was
likely
that
john
would
nt
want
her
to
try
it
would
have
been
easier
on
everybody
would
nt
it
said
becky
if
judge
had
just
died
in
a
heartbeat
during
one
of
his
rages
nora
bonesteel
considered
it
hardly
any
way
is
easy
she
said
when
people
are
taken
sudden
their
families
grieve
because
there
was
nt
time
to
resolve
things
to
make
peace
and
say
good
bye
oftentimes
they
are
left
with
guilt
at
least
you
ve
been
given
time
to
settle
becky
did
nt
see
any
point
in
trying
to
make
peace
with
a
deaf
old
man
who
had
probably
forgotten
most
of
the
injuries
he
had
inflicted
cruel
words
and
slights
that
still
hurt
her
to
the
heart
when
she
let
herself
dwell
on
them
what
could
he
possibly
say
that
would
make
up
for
the
past
and
how
much
sincerity
would
there
be
in
any
profession
of
forgiveness
she
made
speaking
of
resolving
things
you
ve
called
his
daughter
have
nt
you
becky
tilden
s
eyes
widened
and
she
darted
a
glance
at
john
walker
to
see
if
he
had
heard
them
no
she
whispered
i
ca
nt
he
d
never
let
me
nora
bonesteel
s
face
hardened
into
the
scowl
reserved
for
irreverent
boys
in
sunday
school
class
and
why
not
he
would
nt
let
me
he
never
wants
her
to
know
when
he
s
took
sick
he
d
say
it
s
on
account
of
lark
being
so
famous
and
busy
and
all
and
pains
but
that
s
not
the
real
reason
they
did
nt
get
along
you
know
never
did
he
does
nt
want
her
to
come
never
mind
what
he
wants
becky
tilden
and
do
nt
try
to
tell
me
that
an
eighty
three
year
old
man
could
stop
you
from
making
a
phone
call
dying
in
peace
is
a
fine
thing
i
m
sure
but
leaving
your
family
in
peace
is
just
as
important
and
if
that
man
goes
without
letting
his
only
child
come
to
say
good
bye
it
will
be
the
cruelest
thing
he
s
ever
done
to
her
and
to
my
mind
that
s
saying
something
becky
s
face
took
on
the
mulish
expression
that
meant
that
she
would
try
to
get
out
of
the
chore
without
making
an
outright
refusal
even
if
i
call
her
she
may
not
want
to
come
back
she
ought
to
be
given
the
chance
though
it
s
her
that
has
to
go
on
living
with
memories
so
i
say
it
s
that
or
shall
i
becky
s
clouded
face
cleared
with
relief
oh
miz
nora
would
you
tell
him
ever
time
i
try
to
talk
about
lark
he
just
sets
his
face
like
a
stone
idol
and
turns
away
muttering
would
you
like
me
to
take
you
out
to
him
now
so
you
can
tell
him
nora
bonesteel
sighed
i
ve
known
john
a
long
time
but
we
re
not
close
this
would
be
better
coming
from
you
but
if
i
have
to
do
it
i
will
john
walker
never
scared
me
any
not
even
waving
a
black
snake
over
his
head
and
i
m
not
about
to
start
being
afraid
of
him
now
well
try
not
to
upset
him
it
will
be
all
right
becky
i
wo
nt
leave
until
he
s
back
in
a
good
mood
you
go
in
and
call
his
daughter
tell
her
she
may
not
have
long
to
dither
about
this
becky
gasped
know
nora
bonesteel
jared
s
heart
monitor
or
at
least
that
s
what
he
assumed
it
was
attached
to
an
iv
was
pushed
up
against
the
wall
on
a
rolling
bed
waiting
for
a
room
assignment
the
man
or
womanhe
could
nt
tell
whichwas
curled
up
in
a
fetal
position
facing
the
wall
as
he
walked
past
he
could
tell
that
the
patient
on
the
table
was
a
woman
after
glancing
at
the
thinning
tangles
of
long
silver
hair
on
her
pillow
he
saw
a
freshly
bandaged
bloody
stump
where
her
right
foot
should
have
been
as
if
her
stick
thin
leg
had
simply
vanished
at
the
tip
an
amputee
probably
diabetes
he
thought
lucas
heard
the
old
woman
moan
softly
but
he
kept
walking
his
son
s
heart
song
beckoning
him
beyond
the
partition
through
the
clear
plastic
of
the
isolation
tent
over
jared
s
bed
lucas
could
see
his
son
s
face
his
eyes
were
closed
his
eyelids
no
longer
fluttering
immediately
lucas
gazed
at
the
electrocardiograph
monitor
at
jared
s
bedside
to
be
reassured
by
the
jagged
pulses
of
his
heartbeat
on
the
small
screen
good
how
many
nights
had
lucas
fallen
asleep
to
the
sound
of
that
machine
s
beeping
often
sleeping
near
jared
s
heart
monitor
he
d
awakened
from
dreams
that
he
d
heard
the
jarring
tone
of
a
flat
line
signaling
that
jared
s
heart
had
stopped
maybe
they
had
nt
been
dreams
he
thought
sadly
maybe
they
d
only
been
glimpses
into
a
future
that
was
drawing
closer
all
the
time
because
he
had
known
all
along
that
jared
would
not
get
well
had
nt
he
even
when
he
d
pretended
his
knowing
was
only
irrational
dread
left
over
from
losing
rachel
it
had
probably
been
genuine
intuition
all
along
no
surprise
that
jared
s
acute
myelocytic
leukemia
had
turned
out
to
be
so
difficult
to
cure
no
surprise
that
the
chemo
had
nt
worked
no
surprise
that
the
bone
marrow
procedure
had
nt
worked
either
and
ultimately
it
had
been
no
surprise
that
one
of
the
most
powerful
shamans
in
the
world
the
one
jared
called
magic
man
had
nt
been
able
to
it
was
was
determined
to
have
jared
too
and
contrary
to
what
jared
believed
lucas
did
nt
think
it
had
the
first
thing
at
all
to
do
with
god
lucas
was
convinced
it
was
the
work
of
something
else
altogether
three
ravens
perez
the
arizona
based
healer
known
globally
for
his
successful
treatment
of
terminal
patients
had
told
lucas
as
much
in
a
rare
moment
of
weary
frustration
perez
was
an
old
friend
one
of
the
first
shamans
to
teach
lucas
the
observable
merits
of
spirit
based
healing
rituals
and
lucas
had
seen
the
anguish
in
his
friend
s
face
when
perez
had
flown
to
tallahassee
to
perform
a
healing
ceremony
on
jared
shortly
before
the
bone
marrow
transplant
lucas
s
optimism
during
the
brief
remission
period
had
been
crushed
by
something
haunted
in
the
powerful
man
s
eyes
and
perez
s
words
spoken
to
lucas
in
a
hush
while
they
drank
tepid
coffee
had
been
even
more
haunting
this
is
hard
for
me
to
say
to
you
but
you
have
a
right
to
hear
it
the
same
shadows
with
rachel
smelled
the
same
foulness
i
have
never
known
shadows
like
these
i
m
afraid
they
wo
nt
heed
good
medicine
i
think
they
have
hunted
for
him
well
champ
you
missed
a
good
one
today
lucas
began
at
jared
s
beside
his
tone
much
more
upbeat
than
his
thoughts
jared
had
told
him
he
sometimes
heard
the
things
lucas
said
when
he
was
unconscious
or
sleeping
so
lucas
had
made
it
a
habit
to
talk
and
sing
to
him
jared
had
probably
heard
him
sing
every
robert
johnson
song
ever
recorded
from
love
in
vain
to
ramblin
on
my
mind
if
slightly
off
key
in
case
it
made
a
small
difference
slipping
his
gloved
hand
into
the
tent
lucas
smoothed
back
jared
s
wispy
light
brown
hair
which
only
curled
where
it
grew
thickest
at
the
top
of
his
head
the
hair
too
he
d
inherited
from
rachel
along
with
his
skin
color
jared
s
complexion
had
skin
but
his
son
s
face
was
now
almost
ghostlike
as
if
he
d
been
dusted
with
powder
in
the
harsh
glare
of
the
fluorescent
lights
above
them
lucas
could
even
see
tiny
blue
webs
of
capillaries
under
jared
s
skin
just
below
his
eyes
he
looked
almost
like
a
stranger
still
aided
by
the
oxygen
tubes
in
his
nose
jared
s
chest
rose
and
fell
steadily
his
breathing
sounded
good
not
bubbling
in
his
chest
the
way
it
did
when
he
had
fluid
in
his
lungs
lucas
squeezed
jared
s
unmoving
fingers
and
the
warmth
that
bled
through
the
plastic
felt
like
sunshine
let
s
see
now
you
know
i
get
the
names
all
mixed
up
but
i
ll
remember
as
best
i
can
lucas
said
stooping
over
to
speak
close
to
jared
s
ear
these
mutant
men
of
yours
are
ugly
as
can
be
jared
is
ned
nuke
the
one
with
the
face
like
swiss
cheese
in
any
case
i
think
ned
nuke
earth
s
population
by
poisoning
the
air
so
he
and
the
other
one
the
black
one
is
his
name
freddy
fallout
well
the
two
of
them
teamed
up
with
that
really
big
one
who
has
tentacles
for
arms
that
one
you
like
so
much
hearing
the
soothing
tones
of
his
own
voice
lucas
began
to
forget
where
he
was
and
details
from
the
past
few
hours
the
past
few
wretched
years
began
to
melt
away
in
his
mind
this
was
no
different
from
countless
times
before
when
he
d
told
jared
bedtime
stories
about
his
other
favorite
heroes
trying
to
save
the
world
it
was
nt
so
different
at
all
but
his
fantasy
ended
abruptly
when
he
realized
he
could
hear
the
old
woman
calling
out
he
must
have
been
ignoring
her
dismissing
her
voice
as
background
noise
eggs
and
measure
flour
and
make
change
and
nobody
could
abuse
me
and
where
they
d
even
expect
me
to
be
fat
every
flab
roll
and
cellulite
crinkle
would
serve
as
testimony
to
the
excellence
of
my
baked
goods
i
wished
i
could
trade
places
with
the
guy
who
wore
the
fresh
sushi
sandwich
board
and
walked
up
and
down
pine
street
at
lunch
hour
handing
out
sushi
coupons
for
world
of
wasabi
maybe
dead
i
pictured
myself
lying
in
the
bathtub
taping
a
note
to
the
mirror
taking
a
razor
blade
to
my
wrists
then
i
pictured
nifkin
whining
and
looking
puzzled
scraping
his
nails
against
the
rim
of
the
bathtub
and
wondering
why
i
was
nt
getting
up
and
i
pictured
my
mother
having
to
go
through
my
things
and
finding
the
somewhat
battered
copy
of
best
of
penthouse
letters
in
my
top
dresser
drawer
plus
the
pink
fur
lined
handcuffs
bruce
had
given
me
for
valentine
s
day
finally
i
pictured
the
paramedics
trying
to
maneuver
my
dead
wet
body
down
three
flights
of
stairs
we
ve
got
a
big
one
here
i
imagined
one
of
them
saying
okay
so
suicide
was
out
i
thought
rolling
myself
into
the
comforter
and
arranging
the
orange
pillows
under
my
head
the
muffin
shop
sandwich
board
scenario
while
tempting
was
probably
not
going
to
happen
i
could
nt
see
how
to
spin
it
in
the
alumni
magazine
princeton
graduates
who
stepped
off
which
they
would
then
turn
into
a
chain
of
successful
muffin
shops
which
would
then
go
public
and
make
millions
and
the
muffin
shops
would
only
be
a
diversion
for
a
few
years
something
to
do
while
raising
their
kids
who
would
invariably
appear
in
the
alumni
magazine
clad
in
eensy
beansy
black
and
orange
outfits
with
class
of
written
on
their
precocious
little
chests
what
i
wanted
i
thought
pressing
my
pillow
hard
against
my
face
was
to
be
a
girl
again
to
be
on
my
bed
in
the
house
i
d
grown
up
in
tucked
underneath
the
brown
and
red
paisley
comforter
reading
even
though
it
was
past
my
bedtime
hearing
the
door
open
and
my
father
walk
inside
feel
him
standing
over
me
silently
feeling
the
weight
of
his
pride
and
his
love
like
it
was
a
tangible
thing
like
warm
water
i
wanted
him
to
put
his
hand
on
my
head
the
way
he
had
then
to
hear
the
smile
in
his
voice
when
he
d
say
and
loved
and
thin
i
wanted
that
i
rolled
over
groped
for
my
nightstand
grabbed
a
pen
and
paper
lose
weight
i
wrote
then
stopped
and
thought
find
new
boyfriend
i
added
sell
screenplay
buy
large
house
with
garden
and
fenced
yard
find
mother
more
acceptable
girlfriend
somewhere
between
writing
get
and
maintain
stylish
haircut
and
thinking
make
bruce
sorry
i
finally
fell
asleep
good
in
bed
ha
he
had
a
lot
of
nerve
putting
his
name
on
a
column
about
sexual
expertise
given
how
few
people
he
d
even
been
with
and
how
little
he
d
known
before
he
d
met
me
i
had
slept
with
four
people
three
long
term
boyfriends
and
one
ill
considered
freshman
year
fling
when
bruce
and
i
hooked
up
and
i
d
fooled
around
extensively
with
another
half
dozen
i
might
ve
been
a
big
girl
but
i
d
been
reading
cosmopolitan
since
i
was
thirteen
and
i
knew
my
way
around
the
various
pieces
of
equipment
at
least
i
and
bruce
was
nt
he
d
had
a
few
harsh
turn
downs
in
high
school
when
he
d
had
really
bad
skin
and
before
he
d
discovered
that
pot
and
a
ponytail
could
reliably
attract
a
certain
kind
of
girl
when
he
d
shown
up
that
first
night
with
his
sleeping
bag
and
his
plaid
shirt
he
was
nt
a
virgin
but
he
d
never
been
in
a
real
relationship
and
he
d
certainly
never
been
in
love
so
he
was
looking
for
his
lady
fair
and
i
while
not
averse
to
stumbling
into
mr
right
was
mostly
looking
for
well
call
it
affection
attention
actually
call
it
sex
we
started
off
on
the
couch
sitting
side
by
side
i
reached
for
his
hand
it
was
ice
cold
and
clammy
and
when
i
casually
slung
an
arm
over
his
shoulder
then
eased
my
thigh
against
his
i
could
feel
him
shaking
which
touched
me
i
wanted
to
be
gentle
with
him
i
wanted
to
mine
and
tugged
him
off
the
couch
let
s
lie
down
i
said
we
walked
to
my
bedroom
hand
in
hand
and
he
lay
on
my
futon
flat
on
his
back
his
eyes
wide
open
and
gleaming
in
the
dark
looking
a
bit
like
a
man
in
a
dentist
s
chair
i
propped
myself
up
on
my
elbow
and
let
the
loose
ends
of
my
hair
trail
gently
across
his
cheek
when
i
kissed
the
side
of
his
neck
he
gasped
as
if
i
d
burned
him
and
when
i
eased
one
hand
inside
his
shirt
and
gently
tugged
at
the
hair
on
his
chest
he
sighed
ah
cannie
in
the
tenderest
voice
i
d
ever
heard
but
his
kisses
were
horrible
slobbery
things
all
bludgeoning
tongue
and
lips
that
felt
as
if
they
were
somehow
collapsing
when
they
met
mine
so
that
i
was
left
with
a
choice
between
teeth
and
mustache
his
hands
were
stiff
and
clumsy
lie
still
i
whispered
i
m
all
wrong
are
nt
i
shh
i
breathed
my
lips
against
his
neck
once
more
the
tender
skin
right
where
his
beard
ended
i
slid
one
hand
down
his
chest
lightly
feathered
it
over
his
crotch
nothing
doing
i
pressed
my
breasts
into
his
side
kissed
his
forehead
his
eyelids
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
tried
again
still
nothing
well
this
was
curious
i
decided
to
show
him
a
trick
to
teach
him
how
to
make
me
happy
whether
he
could
get
hard
or
not
he
moved
me
enormously
this
was
trotting
by
and
the
captain
looked
at
the
line
passing
down
the
defile
i
think
we
d
better
hurry
to
get
in
front
of
the
band
yep
roger
agreed
looking
at
the
distant
city
i
m
really
looking
forward
to
getting
to
civilization
let
s
not
go
too
fast
pahner
cautioned
as
he
started
forward
this
is
liable
to
be
a
new
experience
different
hazards
different
customs
these
mountains
are
a
fairly
effective
barrier
especially
for
a
bunch
of
cold
blooded
mardukans
so
these
folks
may
not
take
all
that
kindly
to
strangers
we
need
to
take
it
slow
and
careful
slow
down
kosutic
called
the
city
is
nt
going
anywhere
the
company
had
been
moving
through
the
twisting
mountain
valleys
towards
the
distant
city
for
the
last
two
days
it
turned
out
that
the
pass
they
d
exited
from
was
on
a
different
watershed
that
they
d
run
out
of
fodder
for
the
packbeasts
who
were
becoming
increasingly
surly
about
life
in
general
fortunately
they
d
recently
entered
a
flatter
terrain
of
moraines
and
alluvial
wash
it
was
well
forested
and
by
slowing
down
they
d
been
able
to
let
the
flar
ta
forage
but
that
only
worked
if
the
point
kept
the
pace
down
gotcha
sergeant
major
liszez
replied
over
his
helmet
com
and
slowed
down
pausing
for
a
moment
to
look
around
the
path
they
were
following
was
wide
for
a
game
trail
and
well
beaten
the
vegetation
was
open
on
either
side
and
the
lower
limbs
of
the
coniferlike
evergreens
had
been
stripped
off
by
some
forager
which
permitted
good
sight
distance
unlike
the
damn
jungle
he
d
stopped
at
the
edge
of
an
open
area
it
looked
like
whatever
had
been
eating
on
the
trees
had
used
the
clearing
for
rooting
because
the
ground
was
torn
up
and
turned
over
in
every
direction
it
was
also
fairly
other
side
the
morning
was
clear
and
cool
with
the
dew
just
coming
off
the
bushes
this
area
was
a
blessed
relief
for
the
company
but
they
still
wanted
to
keep
moving
not
only
did
they
look
forward
to
a
respite
in
the
city
but
the
faster
they
went
the
sooner
they
would
reach
the
coast
the
coast
was
of
course
only
an
intermediate
stop
but
it
had
begun
to
loom
large
in
the
minds
of
the
company
the
coast
was
an
end
in
itself
now
and
on
maps
it
looked
like
they
were
nearly
there
they
were
nt
at
best
it
was
weeks
away
through
the
jungles
on
this
side
of
the
mountains
but
at
least
it
was
getting
closer
and
closer
and
that
was
a
damned
good
thing
liszez
told
himself
because
good
as
their
nanites
were
at
extracting
usable
nutrition
from
the
most
unlikely
sources
there
were
limits
in
all
things
the
severe
losses
the
company
had
taken
at
voitan
and
marshad
helped
a
because
each
dead
marine
had
been
one
less
charge
on
the
priceless
cache
of
vitamin
and
protein
supplements
packed
on
the
animals
and
on
their
own
backs
fewer
mouths
meant
they
could
stretch
their
stores
further
but
once
the
stores
were
gone
they
were
gone
and
the
shipwrecked
humans
were
dead
so
the
sooner
they
could
get
their
butts
aboard
a
ship
and
set
sail
the
better
liszez
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
decided
the
column
had
closed
up
enough
he
reminded
himself
to
keep
the
pace
down
checked
his
surroundings
for
threats
and
moved
out
on
his
third
step
the
ground
erupted
roger
looked
at
the
trees
the
stripped
bark
reminded
him
of
something
and
he
glanced
at
his
asi
cord
these
trees
yes
flar
ke
we
need
to
be
careful
the
shaman
said
pahner
had
finally
convinced
the
prince
that
the
lead
packbeast
was
not
a
place
for
the
commander
to
be
but
roger
still
big
eleven
millimeter
magnum
hunting
rifle
so
far
in
the
mountains
the
only
hazards
had
been
inanimate
but
marduk
had
taught
them
not
to
let
their
guards
down
and
the
prince
keyed
his
radio
on
the
reserve
command
frequency
captain
cord
says
that
this
area
is
flar
ke
territory
like
where
we
first
met
him
pahner
did
nt
reply
for
a
moment
and
roger
remembered
the
marine
s
incandescent
rage
on
that
long
ago
day
the
prince
never
had
explained
to
the
captain
that
the
company
s
free
flow
com
net
had
been
so
unfamiliarand
confusingto
him
at
the
time
that
he
genuinely
had
nt
heard
the
marine
s
order
not
to
fire
at
the
flar
ke
which
had
been
pursuing
cord
it
had
been
roger
s
very
first
personal
experience
with
a
full
fledged
tongue
lashing
and
pahner
s
fury
had
been
so
intense
that
the
prince
had
decided
that
anything
which
sounded
like
an
excuse
would
have
been
considerably
worse
than
useless
at
the
same
time
even
if
he
had
heard
the
order
he
would
have
taken
the
nt
taken
it
to
save
cord
eitherno
one
had
even
known
the
shaman
was
there
to
be
saved
no
he
d
fired
because
he
d
hunted
more
types
of
dangerous
wild
game
than
most
people
in
the
galaxy
even
realized
existed
and
he
d
recognized
the
territorial
strop
markings
on
the
trees
in
the
area
markings
very
like
those
which
surrounded
them
now
i
see
the
captain
said
finally
and
roger
knew
the
same
memories
had
been
passing
through
the
older
man
s
mind
they
d
never
discussed
the
episode
again
and
roger
sometimes
wondered
how
much
that
owed
to
the
fact
that
the
flar
ke
so
closely
resembledphysically
at
least
the
flar
ta
packbeasts
with
which
the
company
had
become
intimately
familiar
flar
ta
could
be
extremely
dangerous
in
threat
situations
but
the
huge
herbivores
were
scarcely
aggressive
by
nature
and
a
part
of
the
captain
had
to
have
noted
the
relative
passivity
of
the
flar
ta
and
transposed
it
to
the
flar
ke
at
least
subconsciously
as
proof
that
he
d
been
right
to
order
his
nt
even
have
considered
that

on
edge
again
lots
of
that
lately
he
sat
down
beside
me
like
he
usually
did
never
in
the
backseat
unless
he
was
in
conference
only
in
the
front
where
he
could
watch
the
road
and
the
gauges
and
me
he
loved
speed
loved
coming
out
of
a
turn
with
his
head
thrown
back
against
the
rest
he
d
always
ask
me
how
i
did
it
go
that
fast
into
a
turn
and
keep
the
car
on
the

and
i

we
headed
down
from

home
in
the
tustin
hills
it
was
evening
in
the
middle
of
june
the
sun
hanging
in
a
pink
haze
of
clouds
and
smog
lots
of
new
mansions
up

was
a
tear
down
by
the
new
standards
of
the
neighborhood
just
old
and
plain
nothing
wrong
with
it
besides
that
in
fact
it
was
a
good

more
than
good
i

because
i
grew
up
in

my

he
said
checking
his
watch
medina
s
finally
peeking
out
the
windows
again
he
talked
without
looking
at
me
leaned
back
his
head
eyelids
half
down
but
his
eyes
moving
he
usually
looked
like
he
was
disappointed
with
what
he
saw
a
way
to
make
it
better
but
there
was
also
something
affectionate
in
his
expression
pride
of
ownership
will
reached
down
between
his
feet
and
snapped
open
his
leather
briefcase
he
took
out
the
black
calendar
set
the
briefcase
back
on
the
floorboard
then
started
scribbling
with
a
pen
he
liked
to
talk
while
he
wrote
sometimes
it
was
to
himself
and
sometimes
it
was
to
me
growing
up
with
him
since
i
was
five
working
nights
for
him
since
i
was
sixteen
i
ve
come
to
know
when
he
s
was
talking
to
me
or
talking
to
himself
medina
s
getting
a
second
chance
he
registers
five
hundred
illegal
aliens
to
vote
they
tell
a
times
reporter
that
they
re
illegals
but
they
re
allowed
to
vote
in
a
united
states
election
allowed
to
because
medina
told
them
they
could
and
they
all
voted
for
me
because
medina
told
them
to
now
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
that
i
d
already
thought
about
distance
yourself
five
hundred
votes
is
nt
worth
the
scandal
that
s
shortsighted
joe
mean
spirited
and
stupid
is
what
it
is
i
get
the
whole
latino
vote
thanks
to
medina
and
you
think
i
should
toss
him
overboard
who
taught
you
to
treat
your
friends
like
that
will
s
always
teaching
testing
revising
arguing
it
out
saying
things
to
see
how
they
sound
to
see
if
he
believes
them
or
not
i
ve
learned
to
see
some
things
will
s
way
other
things
i
ll
never

will
trona
made
me
what
i
am
but
even
will
can
only
do
so
much
i
m
less
than
half
his
age
i
ve
got
a
long
way
to
go
but
one
thing
will
taught
me
is
to
make
up
your
mind
fast
and
put
the
whole
weight
of
your
being
behind
that
decision
instantly
later
if
you
have
to
change
your
mind
put
all
your
weight
behind
that
decision
never

i

that
and
those
votes
wo
nt

shook
his
head
and
wrote
again
he
s
a
handsome
man
good
build
strong
in
the
neck
and
deep
in
the
chest
with
hands
that
got
strong
and
dark
working
summers
in
construction
helping
himself
through
school
after
vietnam
black
hair
combed
back
gray
on

blue

when
he
looks
at

it
s
the
same
expression
he
gets
in
the
car
head
back
a
little
almost
sleepy
but
the
eyes
are
alert
and
if
he
smiles
the
lines
of
his
fifty
four
years
frame
it
in
a
way
that
convinces
people
that
he
knows
and
likes
them
most
of
the
time
he
does

pay
attention
to

tonight

he
closed
the
calendar
and
slid
it
back
into
the
briefcase
clicked
it
shut
looked
at
his
watch
again
then
he
leaned
against
the
headrest
and
lowered
his
eyelids
halfway
and
watched
the
white
middle
class
boulevard
of
tustin
become
the
barrio
of
santa
ana
how
was
work
today
quiet
sir
it
s
always
quiet
in
there
until
there
s
a
fight
or
a
race
riot
yes
by
day
i
m
a
deputy
for
the
orange
county
sheriff
s
department
i
work
the
central
jail
complex
as
do
all
new

four
years
now

for

and
start
becoming
a
real
cop
i
m
twenty
four
years
old
i
became
a
deputy
because
will
told
me
to
that
s
what
he
was
until
he
got
elected
supervisor
will
told
me
to
become
a
deputy
because
he
thought
it
would
be
good
for
me
and
because
he
thought
it
would
son
in
the
sheriff
s
department
down
on
fourth
street
not
far
from
the
jail
where
i
work
there
s
the
hispanic
american
cultural
front
it
s
jaime
medina

outfit
hacf
does
good
things
distributes
money
and
goods
to
the
hispanic
car
if
it
violated
school
rules
do
nt
treat
me
like
a
cripple
he
had
blurted
as
if
my
mere
enforcement
of
a
rule
did
any
such
thing
but
the
statement
stunned
us
both
and
expression
of
anger
forced
me
to
back
off
i
let
him
take
the
car
despite
myself
but
he
had
still
gone
off
angry
leaving
me
to
fume
even
more
i
recalled
that
with
horror
now
because
that
was
how
had
gone
off
michael
where
are
you
friday
afternoons
at
wiesbaden
were
marked
as
i
imagined
it
by
an
explosion
of
pent
up
all
american
energy
boys
heading
out
to
the
ball
field
girls
in
the
gym
putting
up
crepe
paper
streamers
for
the
sock
hop
kids
in
dungarees
and
pedal
pushers
going
over
to
the
teen
club
to
feed
the
jukebox
and
the
coke
machine
i
pictured
it
all
from
my
place
at
the
large
bow
front
window
looking
across
the
garden
toward
mosbacher
strasse
and
the
happy
images
of
young
people
at
play
undid
me
i
took
in
the
teeth
a
blast
of
new
self
reproach
so
michael
wanted
to
stay
over
in
wiesbaden
and
what
go
to
the
big
game
the
next
day
or
take
a
date
to
the
american
movie
theater
at
the
base
exchange
if
he
did
nt
dance
and
why
not
with
a
car
why
had
i
let
that
become
an
issue
and
what
was
it
about
me
that
sparked
anger
in
those
i
loved
did
his
failure
to
show
up
now
mean
he
was
still
angry
was
this
my
punishment
for
the
real
offense
which
he
had
dared
to
name
that
i
did
treat
him
like
a
cripple
michael
where
are
you
the
clock
was
striking
again
and
to
my
surprise
the
half
conscious
count
i
kept
brought
me
to
seven
seven
o
clock
it
was
nearly
dark
outside
he
was
nt
here
and
he
had
nt
called
if
there
d
been
a
wreck
would
the
german
police
have
a
way
of
knowing
to
call
here
the
thought
of
the
german
police
brought
me
back
to
the
scene
in
rhine
main
hall
on
the
previous
monday
what
i
had
been
reading
about
what
i
had
witnessed
i
replayed
it
the
intruder
coming
up
behind
the
tall
g
touch
the
back
of
his
neck
podium
that
red
spray
the
gunman
disappeared
through
the
curtain
as
quickly
as
he
had
come
in
short
order
the
green
uniformed
police
arrived
the
meeting
was
adjourned
and
i
returned
to
my
office
where
almost
at
once
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
imagined
it
all
the
dead
man
had
been
identified
in
the
program
as
markus
von
siedelheim
a
name
that
meant
nothing
to
me
at
the
time
the
killer
had
escaped
i
gathered
from
several
days
deciphering
of
the
neue
presse
and
from
talk
at
the
office
that
the
police
s
assumption
was
that
von
siedelheim
had
been
murdered
by
crackpot
revolutionary
elements
who
saw
new
economic
ties
between
germany
and
liberia
as
a
renewal
of
imperialist
adventurism
or
perhaps
by
rightists
who
opposed
german
participation
in
the
recently
chartered
common
market
of
which
the
ecsc
was
a
forerunner
the
theories
made
no
sense
to
me
at
the
time
although
such
acts
of
political
violence
would
become
common
in
a
few
years
with
the
arrival
of
the
red
brigade
and
groups
on
the
right
what
jolted
me
instead
was
the
rank
senselessness
of
the
act
it
was
von
siedelheim
s
first
return
to
germany
in
seven
years
in
an
odd
way
the
murder
epitomized
the
feeling
we
all
had
then
of
living
on
the
edge
of
an
abyss
that
was
literally
true
in
germany
with
divisions
of
soviet
tanks
poised
to
strike
at
any
moment
igniting
armageddon
but
the
feared
violence
of
the
cold
war
could
be
denoted
by
nothing
so
rational
as
the
later
political
radicalism
f
kind
of
moral
anarchy
had
come
to
undergird
the
east
west
standoff
even
if
we
could
not
openly
see
it
as
such
if
there
was
a
car
wreck
i
realized
the
police
would
call
the
school
i
went
to
the
foyer
to
the
telephone
and
checking
the
list
that
mandy
my
secretary
had
typed
and
taped
into
cellophane
nearly
nine
months
before
i
found
the
number
of
the
hall
phone
in
michael
s
dormitory
when
the
operator
came
on
i
recited
it
for
the
odd
blasting
rings
went
on
and
on
finally
someone
answered
a
boy
whose
accent
dropped
me
back
to
mobile
alabama
where
i
d
done
navy
boot
camp
as
a
twenty
year
old
more
than
twenty
years
before
i
asked
for
michael
montgomery
the
boy
grunted
and
the
phone
clattered
down
i
could
picture
the
handset
dropping
slapping
the
wall
at
the
end
of
its
cord
bright
noises
in
the
echo
chamber
of
the
corridor
made
me
see
a
rough
game
of
keepaway
at
last
yet
another
boy
new
jersey
came
on
the
line
to
say
that
montgomery
was
a
fiver
as
if
that
explained
everything
i
knew
that
about
half
of
the
dormitory
students
who
were
themselves
a
minority
in
the
school
were
five
day
boarders
routinely
going
home
on
fridays
to
american
posts
bases
and
stations
within
a
couple
of
hours
of
wiesbaden
i
asked
the
boy
if
he
was
sure
michael
montgomery
was
not
there
he
said
yes
and
was
about
to
hang
up
i
declared
he
went
to
check
again
leaving
the
phone
to
bang
against
the
wall
after
another
few
minutes
he
returned
to
say
that
michael
was
nowhere
a
that
if
he
d
stayed
over
they
would
have
seen
him
in
the
caf
at
dinner
but
nobody
had
i
asked
if
there
was
a
dance
that
night
or
a
big
game
the
next
day
and
took
what
i
needed
from
his
answer
that
he
did
nt
know
i
hung
up
before
he
did
where
are
you
once
at
our
place
in
the
adirondacks
michael
and
i
stayed
up
late
into
the
night
sitting
on
the
emotion
literally
moved
me
excited
my
mind
and
spirit
set
my
body
parts
dancing
a
language
half
understood
brimming
with
much
more
than
i
could
comprehend
but
a
language
addressed
to
me
language
belonging
to
me
because
it
described
me
even
when
i
did
nt
know
exactly
what
a
beat
or
rhythm
or
deep
bass
riff
or
falsetto
trill
were
saying
i
was
seized
i
could
recognize
what
amounted
to
ideas
sam
cooke
and
the
soul
stirrers
or
the
swan
silvertones
or
dixie
hummingbirds
or
hank
ballard
and
the
midnighters
though
i
couldnt
translate
the
lucid
shimmering
counterpoint
of
quartet
close
harmony
into
words
part
of
the
magic
the
freedom
of
music
meant
that
i
did
nt
need
to
turn
it
into
words
and
i
guess
i
was
lucky
or
smart
because
i
did
nt
try
to
translate
music
escaped
the
net
of
familiar
everyday
language
the
official
standard
register
of
speech
the
standardized
sound
and
sense
that
too
regularly
felt
as
if
they
werent
addressed
to
me
did
nt
belong
to
me
in
various
degrees
homewood
folks
resisted
the
dominant
vernacular
of
the
language
our
speech
played
against
it
or
you
could
say
fought
since
our
ways
of
talking
were
intended
to
detoxify
certain
features
of
the
common
language
we
felt
unfairly
raised
some
people
not
us
up
because
they
pronounced
particular
words
in
a
specific
fashion
people
who
to
our
ears
flattened
depersonalized
the
rhythm
of
their
english
decorated
the
pronunciation
of
individual
words
who
foregrounded
the
musical
possibilities
of
their
talk
speakers
for
whom
cadence
repetition
tone
beat
metaphor
silence
expressed
a
range
of
meanings
and
messages
others
might
pursue
by
expanding
and
elaborating
their
vocabularies
the
dominant
language
culture
disrespected
us
employed
the
arbitrary
authority
of
its
speech
habits
to
mock
our
culturally
inherited
difference
music
assured
me
there
was
more
out
there
to
experience
than
a
world
already
wrapped
up
tight
in
somebody
elses
words
words
tangling
me
up
in
them
while
they
also
perversely
excluded
me
long
before
i
met
caliban
i
experienced
his
ambivalence
toward
prosperos
tongue
good
african
american
music
said
once
upon
a
time
id
been
fluent
in
tongues
the
music
spoke
and
becoming
an
adult
would
surely
involve
relearning
needing
to
master
these
tongues
again
music
promised
more
it
named
me
stole
my
name
changed
the
names
of
familiar
things
around
me
imbued
ordinary
situations
with
drama
the
way
hollywood
soundtracks
pump
up
the
ante
of
mundane
scenes
transcendent
is
capacity
of
music
to
expand
the
parameters
of
experience
upward
elevating
the
spirit
extending
the
range
of
whats
possible
music
ushers
in
a
transcendent
reality
yes
it
did
and
does
rise
did
inform
my
spirit
but
musics
messages
just
as
consistently
took
dead
aim
at
my
flesh
penetrated
down
to
the
bodys
visceral
core
even
gospel
with
its
drumbeat
and
holler
and
dance
roots
worked
down
to
the
gut
groin
ground
transcendent
okay
but
better
to
say
music
opened
me
up
and
down
and
all
around
many
years
after
leaving
homewood
i
encountered
a
byzantine
icon
in
a
cypriot
church
a
portrait
of
an
angel
with
eyes
all
over
eyes
on
bosom
chin
wings
hands
arms
hundreds
of
all
seeing
eyes
eyes
all
seen
once
the
artist
painted
his
vision
pierced
and
transfigured
by
light
light
entering
light
going
forth
from
the
angels
eyes
a
nimbus
of
light
crowning
her
and
i
think
thats
a
picture
of
how
music
transformed
me
as
own
songs
no
not
transformed
or
transfigured
those
ideas
a
little
too
easy
just
like
the
angel
pictures
a
little
too
pretty
but
im
working
working
to
help
you
see
what
i
mean
because
that
helps
me
see
better
more
were
still
on
the
more
music
said
theres
much
more
to
life
than
meets
the
eye
and
said
you
were
born
with
a
gift
a
faculty
something
like
an
eye
or
ear
and
if
you
learn
how
to
make
it
pay
attention
it
will
reveal
much
more
about
the
more
there
is
to
life
the
more
there
is
to
you
youll
become
different
you
are
different
when
you
pay
attention
everythings
larger
than
if
you
do
nt
today
i
say
to
myself
a
gift
was
planted
long
long
ago
deep
inside
the
music
by
wise
people
wishing
the
best
for
you
wishing
something
extra
for
you
transfiguration
transformation
more
for
you
infused
in
african
american
music
by
beleaguered
people
who
foresaw
your
coming
and
understood
how
desperately
youd
need
what
theyd
sown
themselves
out
to
save
themselves
music
tattooing
invisible
markings
on
their
skin
like
those
electronic
dots
stamped
on
your
palm
unseeable
except
in
a
beam
of
infrared
light
you
must
pass
your
hand
through
before
exiting
from
the
prison
visiting
room
hands
clapping
feet
stomping
a
sway
beat
and
keening
moan
tribal
markings
aglow
when
the
musics
present
identifying
your
ancestors
to
each
other
to
you
and
yours
in
a
vicious
world
that
strips
you
and
mocks
your
nakedness
african
people
who
honored
something
precious
in
themselves
worth
too
much
to
let
anybody
crush
and
found
a
means
to
pass
on
this
knowledge
this
more
this
other
inalienable
part
of
themselves
in
the
songs
they
sang
the
rhythms
thumped
on
drums
or
flesh
with
hands
sticks
feet
the
whole
bodys
bump
and
glide
lift
and
fall
through
air
finally
along
with
the
music
also
coming
before
and
informing
hoop
there
were
stories
they
were
out
there
an
oral
history
so
to
speak
mouth
somebodys
ear
staying
alive
the
thing
was
since
they
were
out
there
being
told
and
retold
you
did
nt
have
to
think
about
them
like
money
in
the
bank
you
could
count
on
them
there
when
you
needed
them
all
kinds
of
stories
for
different
occasions
to
be
told
in
particular
places
at
particular
times
and
as
i
hung
around
the
court
more
and
more
i
heard
the
ball
playing
ones
about
hoop
about
the
playground
game
i
can
look
back
and
say
yes
its
something
i
truly
loved
one
of
the
few
little
creole
friend
eugene
why
you
choose
dillard
ayanna
pressed
her
bridget
snapped
does
it
matter
would
you
be
better
off
if
you
never
met
me
ayanna
thought
about
it
and
came
out
grinning
nah
girl
you
my
dog
i
m
glad
you
came
here
she
responded
with
a
chuckle
bridget
said
and
i
m
not
your
dog
ayanna
i
m
your
girl
that
sounds
a
lot
better
to
me
stop
talking
like
these
rapper
guys
so
much
and
stop
sweating
eugene
too
she
added
you
act
like
you
re
jealous
ayanna
denied
it
she
said
leslie
smiled
at
it
ayanna
was
lying
she
was
jealous
of
eugene
secretly
leslie
figured
that
ayanna
wanted
her
own
light
skinned
wavy
haired
friend
ayanna
wanted
more
than
what
she
felt
she
deserved
and
she
envied
bridget
for
going
for
it
leslie
even
wondered
if
her
houston
friend
would
fall
for
her
older
brother
pierre
he
did
nt
have
the
light
skin
but
he
had
the
dark
wavy
hair
a
head
full
of
it
yula
looked
at
bridget
and
frowned
at
her
choice
of
words
she
joked
you
re
her
girl
bridget
ayanna
caught
on
to
it
and
started
laughing
oh
i
do
nt
get
down
like
that
i
got
ta
have
the
wood
after
the
tongue
the
real
wood
leslie
laughed
and
shook
her
head
ayanna
was
a
trifling
fool
but
she
was
harmless
as
long
as
you
never
took
her
too
seriously
however
the
self
assured
remarks
from
bridget
kept
leslie
on
her
guard
joke
or
no
joke
bridget
in
her
wealth
leslie
envied
that
security
she
had
toiled
every
single
day
of
her
life
to
earn
any
and
every
thing
that
she
had
and
it
was
never
secure
yula
coveted
bridget
s
slim
trim
waistline
although
she
would
never
admit
it
yula
had
learned
to
live
with
what
size
she
was
given
so
they
all
envied
bridget
bridget
could
afford
to
be
confident
and
optimistic
she
was
rich
beyond
income
she
was
rich
in
mind
body
and
in
spirit
the
most
important
wealth
anyway
bridget
told
them
i
m
glad
that
we
re
all
here
with
nowhere
to
go
tonight
because
i
always
wanted
to
play
this
thing
with
you
guys
she
stood
and
rushed
over
to
the
coat
closet
she
pulled
out
a
white
bag
from
the
bottom
and
hurried
back
to
the
dining
room
table
tugging
out
a
brand
new
ouija
board
yula
took
one
look
at
it
and
said
i
know
that
ai
nt
what
i
think
it
is
yeah
it
s
a
wee
gee
board
she
confirmed
ayanna
grinned
and
said
every
time
i
see
that
word
i
think
how
come
it
s
not
pronounced
ou
jah
board
or
just
spelled
differently
leslie
smiled
and
said
o
u
i
is
pronounced
we
in
french
and
it
means
yes
and
ja
or
gee
spelled
j
e
u
means
like
a
game
so
it
basically
means
a
yes
game
or
an
answer
board
she
began
to
clear
their
plates
from
the
table
and
added
it
s
like
witchcraft
where
you
call
out
the
spirits
for
answers
is
it
anything
like
voodoo
ayanna
asked
yula
looked
back
and
forth
at
them
with
large
eyes
leslie
continued
to
smile
while
shaking
her
head
i
do
nt
know
why
you
keep
asking
me
about
voodoo
i
do
nt
know
much
about
that
you
probably
know
more
than
i
do
as
much
as
you
like
to
talk
about
it
that
s
all
ayanna
explained
and
with
you
being
from
new
orleans
and
knowing
french
and
creole
and
everything
i
just
figured
that
you
would
know
leslie
shook
her
head
well
i
do
nt
she
had
often
asked
her
father
about
voodoo
as
a
child
out
of
her
own
curiosity
and
her
father
would
never
talk
about
it
but
she
had
never
asked
her
mother
bridget
asked
them
all
so
is
everyone
willing
to
play
it
it
was
slightly
after
eight
o
clock
leslie
nodded
her
head
and
grabbed
the
last
of
the
food
to
put
away
i
m
willing
she
said
moving
swiftly
to
the
kitchen
ayanna
said
yeah
count
me
in
girl
but
yula
was
uninterested
and
that
was
an
understatement
she
said
aw
hell
naw
i
m
not
playing
that
shit
hell
no
she
hollered
bridget
opened
up
the
box
over
the
dining
room
table
fun
yula
shut
her
eyes
and
refused
to
even
look
at
the
game
ayanna
said
oh
shit
you
got
a
glow
in
the
dark
one
bridget
said
i
figured
it
would
be
more
fun
to
play
it
in
the
dark
yula
started
to
get
up
and
walk
off
with
her
eyes
still
closed
in
the
kitchen
leslie
shoved
the
leftover
food
into
the
refrigerator
and
tossed
the
dirty
plates
into
soapy
water
in
the
sink
to
wash
later
she
began
to
pray
that
the
phone
did
nt
ring
she
even
thought
of
ignoring
it
if
it
did
she
had
some
serious
questions
to
ask
the
spirit
world
she
had
never
come
face
to
face
with
an
actual
ouija
board
before
she
had
only
heard
and
read
about
it
along
with
palm
readings
numerology
tarot
cards
and
everything
else
that
was
deemed
mystical
including
the
often
talked
about
voodoo
ayanna
tried
to
keep
yula
from
leaving
the
room
as
bridget
read
the
instructions
come
on
yula
stop
that
shit
ai
nt
real
ayanna
insisted
while
yanking
yula
s
arm
leslie
sat
and
helped
bridget
with
the
instructions
while
picking
up
the
message
indicator
a
raised
triangular
shaped
pointer
with
an
open
eye
at
the
center
the
ouija
board
sat
out
under
the
dining
room
light
to
effect
a
strong
glow
while
in
the
dark
it
was
labeled
with
the
twenty
six
letters
of
the
english
alphabet
in
a
downward
arc
with
the
ten
basic
counting
numbers
from
one
to
nine
and
then
zero
below
above
the
alphabet
and
in
opposite
corners
of
the
board
were
the
answers
yes
and
no
and
at
the
very
bottom
was
hostess
i
thought
we
might
go
riding
like
old
times
nick
wore
no
emotion
i
ca
nt
sheridan
i
m
working
you
call
that
work
she
laughed
besides
you
re
the
boss
you
set
your
own
hours
sorry
i
ll
have
to
take
a
rain
check
their
gazes
locked
billie
felt
like
an
intruder
finally
sheridan
dismounted
and
handed
over
her
horse
to
a
waiting
groom
she
left
without
comment
although
billie
sensed
her
anger
boiling
inside
billie
looked
at
nick
and
noted
the
strange
twist
to
his
lips
are
you
laughing
at
me
this
is
called
a
grimace
nick
demonstrated
while
he
talked
let
s
start
with
the
basics
now
this
is
a
saddle
billie
he
was
taking
up
his
valuable
time
no
telling
what
was
going
on
back
at
the
house
and
seeing
sheridan
again
after
all
these
months
had
left
him
shaken
he
had
enough
problems
and
billie
pearce
was
only
adding
to
them
this
is
a
stirrup
mr
kaharchek
pay
attention
now
you
slide
it
up
snug
against
the
saddle
like
this
this
is
a
girth
you
unhitch
the
girth
and
the
saddle
slides
off
you
can
take
the
saddle
pads
off
the
horse
at
the
same
time
he
motioned
for
a
stable
hand
lurking
just
inside
the
barn
from
the
look
on
the
kid
s
face
bafflement
and
amusement
he
d
witnessed
the
whole
thing
nick
avoided
eye
contact
instead
he
handed
the
saddle
to
the
youth
and
in
turn
took
a
blue
nylon
halter
from
him
he
pulled
billie
toward
zeke
s
head
always
leave
the
reins
over
the
horse
s
neck
while
you
re
removing
the
bridle
he
placed
her
hand
behind
zeke
s
crown
piece
you
gently
slide
it
over
the
horse
s
ears
and
he
paused
when
billie
s
face
suddenly
registered
pain
her
face
went
white
something
wrong
he
sonmyfoot
the
dumb
son
of
a
horse
is
on
my
foot
she
tried
to
shove
zeke
but
it
was
like
trying
to
move
mount
everest
tears
smarted
her
eyes
nick
reacted
quickly
one
firm
touch
and
the
big
chestnut
gelding
calmly
shifted
away
from
billie
she
stared
wide
eyed
at
her
brand
new
riding
boot
perfectly
branded
with
the
imprint
of
zeke
s
hoof
she
gasped
in
pain
my
foot
is
broken
it
s
probably
shattered
she
glared
at
the
horse
was
she
just
imagining
the
smug
expression
she
d
seen
that
same
look
on
sheridan
flock
s
face
you
did
that
on
purpose
she
accused
she
shot
a
glance
at
nick
he
obviously
finds
it
amusing
nick
had
to
agree
it
did
look
as
though
zeke
were
smiling
i
ll
signaled
for
the
hovering
boy
to
take
zeke
away
and
brush
him
down
before
putting
him
into
his
stall
that
s
not
a
damn
bit
funny
billie
said
as
she
watched
the
horse
walk
away
with
a
jaunty
sway
of
its
hips
if
body
language
was
anything
to
go
by
the
animal
clearly
thought
it
was
the
victor
in
their
little
encounter
as
for
her
jaunty
swaying
was
out
of
the
question
she
could
nt
put
any
weight
on
her
foot
i
ll
never
walk
again
she
wailed
mrs
pearce
please
calm
down
nick
sighed
just
when
he
thought
things
could
nt
get
worse
the
woman
was
really
hurt
she
d
probably
managed
not
to
sign
a
release
form
and
would
likely
sue
the
pants
off
him
his
insurance
company
would
cancel
his
polo
school
would
be
history
and
she
was
hurt
that
was
the
worst
part
his
protective
instincts
snapped
alive
her
pretty
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
she
refused
to
shed
belligerent
set
to
her
chin
and
decided
she
probably
was
brave
even
if
it
did
nt
look
that
way
at
the
moment
he
scooped
her
into
his
arms
and
turned
toward
the
barn
her
mouth
popped
open
in
surprise
but
he
felt
her
arms
circle
around
his
neck
as
though
she
realized
she
had
no
choice
she
pressed
against
him
for
support
just
what
he
needed
after
having
her
fall
full
length
against
him
coming
in
contact
with
him
in
all
the
right
places
he
envisioned
her
children
and
their
friends
coming
home
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
the
smell
of
homemade
cookies
and
tall
glasses
of
milk
he
envied
them
wondered
if
they
realized
how
lucky
they
were
having
been
raised
by
one
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
powerful
families
in
the
state
he
d
had
little
opportunity
for
warm
straight
out
of
the
oven
cookies
and
cold
milk
billie
shifted
and
the
soft
material
of
her
tank
top
brushed
against
his
bare
arms
she
felt
soft
and
curvy
and
feminine
a
nice
contrast
never
be
thin
enough
he
owed
zeke
a
nice
red
apple
damn
he
had
no
business
thinking
how
soft
and
warm
billie
pearce
was
she
had
room
mother
and
pta
spokesperson
written
all
over
her
pretty
face
she
would
never
consider
a
three
day
weekend
filled
with
sun
fun
and
great
sex
she
was
different
and
she
would
nt
appreciate
knowing
he
was
aroused
just
thinking
about
her
inside
the
barn
nick
plunked
her
down
on
a
bench
how
does
it
feel
smushed
smushed
lord
she
was
talking
like
her
sixth
graders
how
do
you
think
it
feels
she
snapped
it
feels
like
a
horse
crushed
it
to
smithereens
we
have
to
get
the
boot
off
oh
no
you
do
nt
not
without
ordering
me
a
morphine
drip
he
almost
smiled
mrs
pearce
i
need
to
examine
your
foot
that
means
i
have
to
pull
off
the
boot
me
drawn
and
quartered
billie
sucked
in
her
breath
and
gripped
the
bench
as
he
gingerly
worked
the
boot
off
her
injured
foot
she
closed
her
eyes
trying
to
remember
the
breathing
techniques
she
d
learned
in
lamaze
class
years
before
as
she
prepared
for
labor
and
delivery
when
her
children
were
born
she
took
a
deep
cleansing
breath
and
concentrated
on
the
top
of
nick
s
head
she
wanted
to
touch
but
he
had
confidence
and
his
stories
were
eventful
and
closely
detailed
most
of
the
work
in
troubadour
suffered
from
generality
the
more
general
the
more
universalthat
seemed
to
be
the
guiding
principle
bill
s
talent
was
particularity
how
the
snow
creaked
underfoot
on
a
very
cold
clear
day
or
what
the
low
white
sun
looked
like
through
a
tangle
of
black
branches
the
tackiness
of
a
just
oiled
rifle
stock
the
tearing
sound
of
a
bored
fire
everything
in
his
work
was
particular
and
true
except
the
people
that
hurt
the
longer
pieces
but
in
bill
s
shortest
most
implicit
stories
and
in
his
occasional
poems
the
exactitude
and
poise
of
his
writing
could
carry
you
away
he
had
me
worried
so
did
jeff
purcell
known
as
little
jeff
because
we
had
another
jeff
purcell
in
our
class
his
cousinbig
jeff
in
fact
little
jeff
was
nt
little
and
big
jeff
was
nt
big
just
bigger
than
little
jeff
who
resented
big
jeff
partly
no
doubt
for
inadvertently
imposing
this
odious
nickname
on
him
little
jeff
was
a
friend
of
mine
so
like
his
other
friends
i
called
him
purcell
purcell
habitually
kept
his
arms
folded
across
his
chest
like
a
civil
war
general
in
a
daguerrotype
this
bellicose
pose
suited
him
under
his
bristling
crew
cut
he
cultivated
a
sulfurous
gift
for
invective
and
contempt
he
was
the
herod
of
our
editorial
sessions
poised
to
strike
down
every
innocent
who
presumed
to
offer
us
a
aesthetic
purcell
even
flouted
the
timeless
protocol
of
pretending
to
admire
the
work
of
his
fellow
editors
at
one
of
our
meetings
he
declared
that
a
story
of
mine
called
suicide
note
read
as
if
it
d
been
written
after
the
narrator
blew
his
brains
out
purcell
came
from
a
rich
social
family
but
you
would
nt
have
guessed
it
from
his
stories
and
poems
or
maybe
you
would
his
subject
was
the
injustice
of
relations
between
high
and
low
he
had
written
a
ballad
about
a
miner
being
sent
deep
into
the
earth
to
perish
in
a
cave
in
while
the
mine
owner
hand
feeds
filet
mignon
to
his
hunting
dogs
cooing
to
them
in
baby
talk
and
his
last
troubadour
piece
was
an
epistolary
story
in
which
a
general
writes
congratulatory
letters
to
various
grieving
women
after
getting
their
husbands
and
sons
slaughtered
you
may
rejoice
for
your
fallen
hero
knowing
that
his
heart
was
perforated
for
our
glorious
cause
and
you
and
your
little
ones
can
rest
assured
that
his
missing
head
wherever
it
may
radiant
memories
of
the
homeland
for
which
he
died
so
eagerly
this
story
was
i
felt
sure
inspired
by
a
certain
passage
in
a
farewell
to
arms
but
when
it
came
up
for
consideration
i
bit
my
tongue
and
let
it
go
it
was
nt
bad
cartoonish
of
course
like
all
of
purcell
s
work
lurid
and
overwrought
to
be
sure
but
venomously
alive
anyway
i
myself
was
in
debt
to
hemingway
up
to
my
ears
so
was
bill
we
even
talked
like
hemingway
characters
though
in
travesty
as
if
to
deny
our
discipleship
that
is
your
bed
and
it
is
a
good
bed
and
you
must
make
it
and
you
must
make
it
well
or
today
is
the
day
of
meatloaf
the
meatloaf
is
swell
it
is
swell
but
when
it
is
gone
the
not
having
meatloaf
will
be
tragic
and
the
meatloaf
man
will
not
come
anymore
all
of
us
owed
someone
hemingway
or
cummings
or
kerouacor
all
of
them
and
more
we
surely
there
because
imitation
was
the
only
charge
we
never
brought
against
the
submissions
we
mocked
so
cruelly
there
was
no
profit
in
it
once
crystallized
consciousness
of
influence
would
have
doomed
the
collective
and
necessary
fantasy
that
our
work
was
purely
our
own
even
purcell
kept
mum
on
that
subject
he
was
a
threat
his
attack
was
broad
even
crude
but
you
could
feel
his
discomfort
with
the
cushion
he
d
been
born
on
and
his
fear
that
it
would
turn
him
into
one
of
the
fatuous
bloodsuckers
he
wrote
about
if
he
humanized
his
targets
muted
his
voice
used
a
knife
instead
of
a
cudgel
yet
he
did
nt
necessarily
have
to
do
any
of
that
in
a
field
of
stiffs
one
of
his
cartoons
could
win
for
simply
being
alive
these
then
were
the
boys
who
stood
between
me
and
robert
frost
of
course
there
were
other
self
confessed
writers
in
my
form
but
i
d
read
their
english
papers
and
troubadour
submissions
and
seen
nothing
why
did
so
many
of
us
want
to
be
writers
it
seemed
unreasonable
but
there
were
reasons
the
atmosphere
of
our
school
crackled
with
sexual
static
we
had
the
occasional
dance
with
miss
cobb
s
academy
and
a
few
other
girls
schools
but
these
brief
affairs
only
cranked
up
the
charge
and
though
from
day
to
day
we
saw
the
master
s
wives
roberta
ramsey
alone
had
the
goods
to
enter
our
dreams
the
absence
of
an
actual
girl
to
compete
for
meant
that
every
other
prize
became
feminized
for
honors
in
sport
scholarship
music
and
writing
we
cracked
our
heads
together
like
mountain
rams
and
to
make
your
mark
as
a
writer
was
equal
as
proof
of
puissance
to
a
brilliant
season
on
the
gridiron
this
aspect
of
my
ambition
was
obscure
to
me
at
the
time
but
there
was
another
that
i
did
recognize
though
vaguely
and
almost
in
spite
of
myself
the
problem
of
class
our
school
was
proud
of
its
hierarchy
of
character
and
deeds
work
outside
and
that
it
would
wean
us
from
habits
of
undue
pride
and
deference
this
was
a
good
dream
and
we
tried
to
live
it
out
even
while
knowing
that
we
were
actors
in
a
play
and
that
outside
the
theater
was
a
world
we
would
have
to
reckon
with
when
the
curtain
closed
and
the
doors
were
flung
open
class
was
a
fact
not
just
the
clothes
a
boy
wore
all
the
old
furnishings
and
antiques
like
someone
lovingly
looking
at
religious
icons
in
a
church
i
was
sure
any
other
child
would
have
been
bored
but
not
baby
celeste
her
patience
amazed
me
mama
of
course
was
not
surprised
by
baby
celeste
s
behavior
at
all
she
believed
baby
celeste
was
the
true
heir
of
all
the
family
s
spiritual
powers
she
ll
had
told
me
do
nt
just
stand
there
looking
stupid
noble
she
snapped
at
me
now
i
told
you
the
woman
is
on
her
way
here
she
could
be
coming
down
the
driveway
any
moment
hurry
okay
mama
i
scooped
up
baby
celeste
the
gravity
and
criticality
mama
had
whenever
she
wanted
baby
celeste
hidden
away
frightened
me
i
had
nightmares
of
her
being
discovered
and
then
taken
from
us
for
one
reason
or
another
after
all
what
sort
of
people
keep
a
baby
hidden
from
the
world
where
did
the
baby
come
from
anyway
they
d
wonder
why
was
her
hair
being
dyed
if
i
expressed
my
fear
about
this
mama
would
shake
her
head
at
me
as
if
i
were
too
stupid
to
ever
know
anything
do
nt
you
understand
that
they
would
never
let
that
happen
noble
she
asked
i
would
have
thought
you
did
by
now
the
they
in
our
lives
were
the
in
and
out
watching
over
us
always
i
did
nt
disbelieve
her
i
had
seen
the
way
they
looked
at
us
and
watched
over
us
warning
mama
of
things
from
time
to
time
the
way
baby
celeste
looked
in
the
direction
of
a
family
soul
and
the
way
her
eyes
grew
small
and
interested
convinced
me
she
had
already
crossed
over
perhaps
mama
was
right
about
her
perhaps
she
came
directly
from
them
and
did
nt
need
to
cross
she
was
never
away
from
them
birth
had
simply
been
another
doorway
in
the
spiritual
world
for
her
and
not
as
it
was
for
the
rest
of
us
a
doorway
to
a
lesser
place
making
it
necessary
for
us
to
find
our
own
way
back
up
we
go
i
sang
and
ascended
the
stairs
baby
celeste
smiled
at
me
and
lay
her
head
on
my
shoulder
i
kissed
her
little
forehead
and
brushed
back
her
hair
how
could
anyone
who
saw
us
together
not
know
instantly
she
was
my
child
and
that
was
why
she
grimaced
whenever
i
did
show
baby
celeste
too
much
affection
you
can
love
her
but
as
a
brother
would
love
a
sister
as
a
sister
she
would
constantly
remind
me
baby
celeste
was
truly
locked
away
in
the
world
mama
envisioned
for
us
i
wondered
how
being
so
confined
so
isolated
would
effect
baby
celeste
how
long
could
it
go
on
when
would
it
end
or
would
it
never
end
rarely
feeling
the
sunlight
on
her
face
rarely
smelling
the
aroma
of
spring
flowers
hardly
ever
luxuriating
in
the
soft
touch
of
the
breeze
baby
celeste
would
surely
be
disadvantaged
in
ways
i
could
nt
imagine
and
yet
when
i
sat
with
her
in
the
turret
and
listened
to
mama
and
her
customer
s
muffled
voices
below
i
realized
how
similar
my
plight
was
to
my
baby
s
was
nt
i
as
trapped
and
shut
away
in
the
prison
of
noble
s
identity
rarely
did
i
look
out
as
i
would
if
i
were
as
distant
to
me
as
playing
and
being
in
daylight
was
to
baby
celeste
we
re
alike
in
so
many
ways
celeste
i
told
her
whispered
to
her
while
we
waited
in
the
turret
room
she
glanced
at
me
the
tiny
dimple
in
her
cheek
flashing
like
a
small
christmas
light
as
she
tightened
those
sweet
small
lips
often
when
she
looked
at
me
or
listened
to
me
she
seemed
so
much
older
she
wore
the
face
of
someone
who
understood
things
far
beyond
her
years
and
then
an
instant
later
she
was
baby
celeste
again
laughing
and
giggling
at
the
most
insignificant
little
things
a
ray
of
sunshine
trapped
the
floating
dust
and
she
marveled
at
the
way
the
particles
glittered
she
reached
out
to
touch
them
and
then
laughed
and
looked
at
me
to
see
if
i
had
the
same
wonder
i
smiled
a
long
time
ago
so
many
things
were
full
of
wonder
for
me
stuck
in
the
dark
places
now
i
closed
my
eyes
stepping
too
far
to
the
left
or
too
far
to
the
right
nothing
frightened
me
as
much
as
disappointing
mama
more
often
than
ever
these
days
she
made
me
feel
it
was
only
the
three
of
us
floating
on
some
raft
in
a
sea
of
turmoil
we
needed
each
other
we
had
to
keep
our
world
tightly
guarded
behind
tall
thick
protective
walls
it
was
only
then
that
we
would
be
safe
baby
celeste
played
quietly
with
one
of
her
dolls
while
we
waited
shortly
after
baby
celeste
had
been
born
mama
had
brought
out
the

mr
taylor
kotes
the
owner
of
the
biggest
lumber
company
in
the
community
had
given
to
me
he
had
courted
mama
after
daddy
s
death
and
there
was
a
time
i
thought
he
would
become
our
new
daddy
but
he
was
killed
in
a
terrible
car
accident
when
a
drunken
teenager
in
a
truck
rammed
into
him
on
his
way
home
from
our
house
i
had
really
begun
to
like
him
too
even
noble
had
started
to
accept
him
his
death
reinforced
some
of
the
rumors
about
mama
especially
because
mr
kotes
s
sister
spread
them
back
then
she
had
people
believing
that
anyone
who
got
too
close
to
us
was
in
some
sort
of
danger
mama
was
beautiful
and
still
striking
she
could
have
had
one
man
after
another
romancing
her
but
she
did
nt
seem
to
mind
our
isolation
in
fact
she
welcomed
it
especially
after
my
supposed
kidnapping
being
a
former
schoolteacher
she
continued
my
homeschooling
back
in
those
days
i
could
count
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
how
many
visitors
we
to
with
you
amy
made
a
face
she
d
been
watching
movie
stars
kiss
her
whole
life
and
had
wanted
to
be
on
the
receiving
end
of
one
of
those
romantic
embraces
but
his
tongue
in
her
mouth
if
you
do
nt
like
it
come
on
amy
take
a
chance
for
once
do
nt
be
such
a
scaredy
cat
it
was
the
name
calling
that
made
her
take
the
risk
scaredy
cat
she
was
nt
ever
going
to
be
afraid
like
her
mother
all
right
she
told
him
go
ahead
but
if
i
do
nt
like
it
i
ll
stop
he
promised
her
his
thumb
caught
on
the
pulse
at
her
throat
and
she
knew
he
must
have
felt
it
racing
he
grinned
then
said
here
goes
nothing
she
closed
her
eyes
and
waited
she
felt
something
wet
on
her
lips
and
jerked
backward
i
have
nt
done
anything
yet
he
protested
come
back
here
she
closed
her
eyes
again
and
forced
herself
to
relax
this
time
she
let
herself
enjoy
the
feel
of
his
soft
wet
tongue
caressing
her
closed
lips
from
one
side
to
the
other
to
her
surprise
her
body
quivered
luke
slid
your
hands
around
my
neck
she
obeyed
him
sliding
her
arms
up
around
his
neck
and
into
his
hair
that
brought
her
small
breasts
into
contact
with
his
chest
which
was
surprisingly
muscular
he
lowered
his
head
again
his
mouth
closing
over
hers
his
tongue
gently
seeking
entrance
probing
at
the
seam
of
her
lips
you
have
to
open
up
for
me
baby
he
murmured
amy
sighed
in
resignation
and
barely
parted
her
lips
she
felt
his
tongue
slide
into
her
mouth
and
recede
and
felt
another
surprising
quiver
of
excitement
her
hands
tightened
around
his
neck
and
she
leaned
her
body
against
his
waiting
for
the
next
intrusion
she
could
feel
the
texture
of
his
tongue
and
taste
him
he
tasted
good
like
buttery
popcorn
and
coke
amy
had
an
analytical
mind
and
she
wanted
to
dissect
the
experience
but
she
was
starting
to
feel
things
she
d
never
felt
heat
and
need
and
desire
his
tongue
was
moving
in
and
out
lip
and
then
receding
she
sucked
on
it
to
keep
it
where
it
was
and
heard
luke
gasp
they
broke
the
kiss
and
stared
at
one
another
with
glazed
eyes
what
s
wrong
she
said
what
did
you
do
i
do
nt
know
you
sucked
on
my
tongue
he
accused
i
m
sorry
no
it
felt
good
do
it
again
before
she
could
protest
he
was
kissing
her
again
his
tongue
in
her
mouth
and
she
sucked
on
it
like
she
had
before
and
felt
his
body
tense
beneath
her
hands
he
broke
the
kiss
again
and
laid
his
brow
against
hers
oh
god
amy
does
this
feel
as
good
to
you
as
it
does
to
me
in
response
amy
simply
caught
him
by
the
ears
and
pulled
his
head
down
to
kiss
him
she
found
his
lips
closed
and
ran
her
tongue
along
the
seam
as
he
it
was
almost
a
sound
of
pain
but
she
knew
she
was
nt
hurting
him
she
pressed
her
tongue
against
his
lips
seeking
entrance
and
he
opened
to
her
amy
s
tongue
slid
inside
his
mouth
and
he
clasped
her
tight
his
tongue
dueling
with
hers
as
they
each
sought
to
pleasure
the
other
they
were
both
breathing
hard
by
the
time
they
broke
the
kiss
amy
s
knees
were
threatening
to
buckle
again
and
her
breasts
ached
we
better
stop
this
she
said
why
luke
said
you
like
it
do
nt
you
that
s
not
the
point
that
s
precisely
the
point
luke
said
if
it
feels
good
do
it
some
people
have
to
think
of
consequences
amy
said
to
hell
with
consequences
luke
said
reaching
for
her
amy
broke
free
if
you
want
to
be
my
boyfriend
luke
creed
you
will
learn
does
that
mean
you
re
going
to
be
my
girlfriend
amy
realized
what
she
d
done
partnered
up
with
someone
wild
and
irresponsible
someone
who
flouted
the
rules
at
every
turn
it
sounded
wonderful
yes
she
said
it
does
she
d
kissed
him
again
and
used
her
tongue
and
enjoyed
every
long
delicious
minute
of
it
they
d
spent
the
next
four
years
as
inseparable
companions
but
they
d
never
consummated
the
relationship
until
prom
night
the
mare
had
slowed
and
amy
realized
the
animal
was
laboring
to
breathe
and
reined
her
to
a
stop
she
felt
as
enervated
as
the
mare
who
stood
on
shaky
legs
waiting
for
amy
to
direct
her
where
to
go
amy
slid
out
of
the
saddle
and
leaned
against
the
mare
feeling
the
tears
sting
her
nose
and
well
in
her
eyes
god
she
was
such
a
fool
she
d
wanted
someone
responsible
someone
reliable
someone
she
could
count
on
to
stand
by
her
luke
would
never
be
that
man
so
she
d
married
carl
nash
and
stayed
with
him
for
eleven
long
years
as
much
a
captive
as
her
mother
had
ever
been
her
marriage
had
ended
a
year
ago
she
was
free
back
in
bitter
creek
to
visit
her
parents
her
mother
who
still
lived
within
the
same
four
walls
and
her
father
who
still
patiently
pitied
her
amy
s
blond
hair
was
too
short
for
a
ponytail
these
days
and
she
pulled
off
her
stetson
and
set
it
on
the
saddle
horn
then
lifted
the
hair
off
her
nape
with
both
hands
so
the
breeze
could
reach
the
sweat
and
cool
her
she
was
standing
like
that
eyes
closed
when
she
heard
hoofbeats
hey
a
voice
called
out
to
her
i
could
nt
believe
my
eyes
it
really
is
you
amy
felt
her
heart
speed
at
the
sight
of
luke
it
was
as
though
her
thoughts
had
conjured
him
she
quickly
dropped
her
hands
and
what
a
nice
surprise
she
said
with
a
smile
she
felt
her
smile
widen
and
did
nt
try
to
stop
it
she
was
glad
to
preface
on
the
morning
of
september
i
was
doing
what
i
do
as
well
as
anyone
i
know
that
is
not
writing
this
is
an
enduring
part
of
my
daily
routine
something
like
the
unbirth
day
party
in
through
the
looking
glass
unlike
some
of
my
colleaguesmainly
the
ones
i
do
nt
really
care
fori
do
not
fly
to
my
desk
each
morning
with
a
full
heart
and
a
ready
hand
i
skirt
the
perimeters
of
my
home
office
with
a
sense
of
dread
eyes
averted
from
an
empty
computer
screen
instead
of
creation
there
is
always
procrastination
the
call
to
my
closest
friend
to
chew
over
the
morning
paper
and
to
gossip
which
sometimes
comes
to
the
same
thing
the
power
walk
in
central
park
and
the
interlude
at
starbucksmy
husband
calls
it
four
bucksand
the
triple
venti
no
foam
latte
luckily
the
laundry
room
is
five
stories
below
my
office
or
i
could
surely
eke
out
another
half
hour
folding
sheets
and
t
shirts
several
years
ago
my
daughter
downloaded
a
computer
before
i
had
used
up
all
the
demonstration
games
i
played
over
and
over
in
single
minded
pursuit
of
nothing
more
than
a
position
on
a
scoreboard
that
only
i
ever
saw
and
on
which
i
was
known
as
big
mama
eventually
i
deleted
the
program
i
had
developed
a
terrible
tetris
problem
a
decade
earlier
that
had
enabled
me
to
put
off
writing
until
well
past
a
m
and
i
could
see
which
way
things
were
headed
i
am
a
creature
of
habit
it
is
all
that
allows
me
to
write
in
the
first
place
the
routine
designed
to
ward
off
the
moment
and
then
the
moment
itself
when
the
first
feeble
sentence
often
merely
a
prelude
to
better
things
appears
as
my
fingersplay
word
jazz
on
the
keyboard
what
follows
is
usually
a
manic

or
three
hours

by
caffeine

i
did
not
want
to
learn
to
type
but
the
nuns
insisted
saying
someday
typed
or
be
employed
by
a
man
who
needed
the
same
done
to
his
business
letters
my
fingers
are
the
only
sure
handed
things
about
me
when
i
first
sit
down
to
write
after
all
those
years
in
newsrooms
i
am
a
very
fast
typist
indeed
as
fast
as
any
executive
secretary
but
it
was
the
variation
from
routine
that
enables
me
to
remember
that
morning
in
particular
remember
it
before
it
became
the
morning
of
the
most
important
day
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
during
my
lifetime
it
was
my
eldest
child
s
eighteenth
birthday
and
that
morning
at
breakfast
his
father
and
i
had
recalled
with
clarity
and
more
than
a
little
schmaltz
the
stiflingly
hot
morning
when
he
had
arrived
limp
and
gray
after
a
forceps
delivery
twelve
days
before
we
had
left
him
at
college
for
the
first
time
and
we
were
still
smarting
from
the
fissure
in
our
family
before
we
got
into
the
car
and
drove
away
we
reminded
him
yet
again
that
when
he
turned
eighteen
he
was
obliged
by
law
selective
service
neither
of
us
felt
any
fear
when
we
told
him
to
do
that
it
seemed
almost
quaint
that
particular
demand
at
that
moment
in
time
from
the
two
of
us
the
former
boy
who
had
lived
through
the
vietnam
draft
lottery
the
former
girlfriend
who
had
stood
by
breathless
waiting
for
his
number
to
come
up
the
young
couple
exhaling
in
relief
after
if
i
had
thought
there
was
any
chance
my
son
would
be
forced
to
go
to
war
i
would
have
bought
him
a
ticket
to
canada
instead
of
driving
him
to
connecticut
there
were
two
other
reasons
that
i
remember
that
morning
so
clearly
as
well
the
day
before
my
daughter
and
i
had
attended
the
funeral
of
a
family
friend
in
pennsylvania
and
once
i
was
done
with
my
nonwriting
rituals
i
intended
to
write
about
her
about
the
considerable
inspiration
that
the
lives
of
valiant
older
people
provide
us
i
had
gone
straight
from
that
funeral
to
a
hospital
where
my
closest
friend
was
having
cancer
surgery
surgery
that
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
remembering
almost
anything
at
this
moment
in
my
lifewhile
i
once
did
a
column
tied
to
my
age
called
life
in
the
s
i
now
say
that
the
fifties
version
would
be
entitled
where
the
hell
did
i
leave
my
keys
i
do
remember
how
i
felt
that
particular
morning
as
i
settled
into
the
old
windsor
chair
at
which
i
finally
finished
with
preliminaries
sat
down
to
write
i
felt
painfully
mortal
quite
vulnerable
and
enormously
grateful
over
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
the
entire
city
in
which
i
work
the
entire
country
in
which
i
live
would
come
to
feel
much
the
same
way
for
me
there
was
a
peculiar
reason
for
gratitude
as
the
horrible
events
of
that
day
unspooled
in
a
long
endless
loop
of
cataclysmic
news
footage
when
my
husband
called
to
tell
me
to
turn
on
the
television
we
both
thought
there
had
been
a
freak
accident
but
as
i
watched
the
arc
of
that
second
plane
as
it
south
of
our
narrow
victorian
row
house
i
knew
that
something
uniquely
terrible
was
taking
place
i
also
had
reason
to
believe
that
everyone
i
cared
for
most
was
safe
my
husband
across
the
hudson
at
his
office
the
children
at
their
schools
my
friend
in
the
hospital
across
town
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
talk
to
one
another

with

and

shut
down

of
the
mementos

kept

that
morning

moment
of
silence
then
from
the
kitchen
sink
susan
stares
at
it
she
finally
stands
and
a
int
susan
s
apartment
night
a
slowly
walks
into
the
kitchen
she
reaches
out
and
turns
the
faucet
handle
tightens
it
the
dripping
stops
relieved
susan
turns
away
drip
drip
it
begins
again
louder
more
intense
scared
susan
turns
back
to
the
sink
water
is
now
gushing
out
from
the
faucet
filling
up
a
bowl
in
the
sink
she
slowly
reaches
out
a
hand
and
turns
the
faucet
as
tightly
as
she
can
manage
tighter
tighter
straining
with
the
effort
until
the
water
stops
only
then
does
she
let
go
just
then
a
child
s
pale
hand
quietly
rises
to
the
surface
from
water
in
the
bowl
and
starts
violently
splashing
the
surface
susan
screams
and
runs
back
to
her
bedroom
b
int
susan
s
apartment
bedroom
the
quilt
to
her
chin
a
final
retreat
susan
please
stop
it
the
splashing
sounds
in
the
kitchen
continue
for
a
while
then
it
suddenly
stops
susan
is
so
terrified
that
she
almost
faints
then
her
breathing
stops
her
eyes
widen
her
hand
reaches
up
under
her
pillow
feeling
around
and
she
comes
out
with
her
lucky
rabbit
s
foot
the
one
she
left
behind
in
the
stairwell
susan
suddenly
cries
out
her
head
tilting
back
her
body
abruptly
going
stiff
we
soon
see
why
a
lump
begins
to
rise
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
big
one
moving
slowly
up
susan
s
body
reaching
the
edge
of
the
quilt
which
slowly
rises
revealing
a
quick
flash
of
the
pale
face
of
the
japanese
woman
with
long
dark
hair
on
top
of
her
susan
screams
and
is
abruptly
pulled
under
the
covers
cut
to

ext
football
field
day
pov
we
are
looking
out
from
inside
a
football
helmet
we
hear
the
super
present
breathing
of
the
helmet
s
occupant
just
over
the
breathing
we
can
hear
the
muffled
shouting
of
a
snap
count
we
are
in
a
crouch
position
looking
downfield
at
the
call
of
hike
we
and
everyone
on
the
field
spring
into
action
we
sprint
downfield
the
breathing
becoming
even
louder
a
very
big
person
still
on
the
move
we
pan
quickly
around
to
look
back
for
the
quarterback
barely
visible
among
converging
bodies
he
is
releasing
the
football
toward
someone
else
easing
up
on
the
run
we
pan
back
around
to
look
downfield
just
as
the
oncoming
defender
is
upon
us
and
crunch
slams
into
us
a
strobing
pan
leaves
us
looking
up
at
the
sky
our
loud
breathing
has
stopped
after
a
long
beat
the
breathing
resumes
with
a
raggedy
labored
inhale
it
continues
irregularly
another
helmeted
player
appears
above
us
to
peer
down
into
our
helmet
he
extends
a
hand
to
help
us
up
huddle
we
are
looking
back
and
forth
around
the
circle
at
our
gathered
teammates

line
of

lined
up
opposite

a
snarling
defender
once
again
over
loud
breathing
we
can
just
hear
the
shouted
count
at
hike
we
straighten
to
meet
the
defensive
lineman
lunging
horrific
close
up
he
strains
against
us
his
animal
gurgles
of
effort
audible
over
our
own
ragged
breath
with
a
primal
roar
from
the
defenseman
our
pov
tips
back
and
up
booming
down
to
stop
with
a
crunch
against
the
ground
staring
up
once
again
our
breathing
has
stopped
after
a
beat
a
foot
is
planted
on
our
helmet
as
a
looming
running
back
steps
on
us
in
his
charge
downfield
he
is
pursued
by
defenders
some
of
whom
leap
over
us
and
some
of
whom
by
the
sound
of
it
step
on

our
breathing
is
torn
by
rasping
wheezes
of
effort
as
we
continue
to
run
we
look
back
every
player
is
looking
directly
at
us
a
huge
spiralling
football
coming
at
us
too
close

soon
and

it
bounces
off
our

and
flies
up

are
looking

just
as

we
are
hit
by
the
defender
we
once
again
land
face
up
very
steeply
foreshortened
right
over
us
we
see
the
defender
juggling
the
live
ball
with
a
moan
our
own
hand
reaches
weakly
up
towards
the
ball
and
the
high
distant
defender
he
finally
gathers
in
the
ball
and
securely
tucks
it
and
starts
back
upfield
we
climb
wearily
to
our
feet
we
look
back
upfield
just
in
time
to
see
the
defender
start
an
elaborate
victory
dance
in
the
end
zone
he
pauses
for
a
moment
to

you
get
the
tattoo
removed
rusty
given
its
location
my
doctor
advised
he
asked
with
the
faintest
edge
in
his
voice
all
i
want
is
an
honest
answer
he
sighed
i
love
you
jess
you
know
that
his
face
was
a
pale
mask
in
the
glare
of
oncoming
headlights
as
a
newsman
jonathon
dealt
only
with
facts
his
biggest
drawback
was
also
his
greatest
asset
he
d
never
lie
to
her
i
ca
nt
make
any
promises
i
do
nt
know
when
or
if
i
ll
be
ready
for
more
than
this
we
hardly
see
each
other
as
it
is
she
reminded
him
i
know
he
said
i
wish
it
did
nt
have
to
be
this
way
but
my
children
come
first
for
now
at
least
jessie
was
doing
her
best
to
understand
but
right
now
she
was
too
upset
what
would
erin
do
she
wondered
but
erin
with
her
adoring
husband
and
perfect
child
might
as
well
be
in
a
different
universe
how
could
she
possibly
know
what
it
was
like
to
have
the
man
she
loved
slip
through
her
fingers
not
that
it
was
over
she
knew
jonathon
had
been
but
was
it
enough
she
was
nt
sure
how
much
longer
she
could
stand
being
in
limbo
they
drove
in
silence
the
rest
of
the
way
the
rain
had
tapered
off
by
the
time
jonathon
pulled
to
a
stop
in
front
of
her
building
a
converted
brownstone
in
chelsea
on
the
corner
of
twentieth
and
ninth
glancing
up
at
the
third
floor
to
see
her
windows
ablaze
she
realized
that
she
d
forgotten
to
turn
out
her
lights
as
she
was
dashing
out
the
door
hours
ago
that
seemed
more
like
a
lifetime
damn
as
if
her
overdue
con
edison
bill
was
nt
already
enough
to
bankrupt
a
third
world
nation
more
than
most
people
paid
in
rent
in
her
hometown
of
willow
creek
it
served
to
remind
her
of
her
career
slump
which
at
the
moment
seemed
to
mirror
the
state
of
her
love
life
see
you
tomorrow
jonathon
said
hopefully
i
do
nt
know
i
m
going
to
be
pretty
busy
she
hedged
you
he
shut
off
the
engine
turning
to
regard
her
gravely
mad
no
more
like
crushed
what
about
tuesday
then
do
nt
you
have
therapy
right
i
forgot
tuesday
evenings
he
and
his
ex
wife
and
children
had
family
therapy
until
she
d
started
seeing
jonathon
jessie
had
nt
even
known
there
was
such
a
thing
postdivorce
just
as
well
she
said
airily
i
promised
drew
i
d
help
him
go
over
the
photos
for
his
show
let
jonathon
wonder
if
her
upstairs
neighbor
was
more
than
just
a
good
friend
he
took
hold
of
her
arm
as
she
was
climbing
out
of
the
car
in
the
glare
of
a
streetlamp
through
the
rain
dribbling
down
the
windshield
his
face
was
cast
in
a
queer
undersea
glow
i
m
not
saying
it
ll
always
be
this
way
he
said
softly
i
just
i
want
to
be
honest
about
where
things
stand
she
said
in
a
low
quivering
voice
i
m
not
going
to
lie
to
you
jess
all
right
then
since
we
re
being
so
honest
she
said
do
nt
count
on
me
sticking
around
until
you
make
up
your
mind
unlike
erin
who
never
had
any
trouble
speaking
her
mind
jessie
usually
found
it
hard
to
express
her
feelings
but
this
time
the
words
came
easily
the
hard
part
she
knew
would
be
following
through
he
arched
a
brow
is
that
an
ultimatum
no
just
the
way
it
is
with
a
sigh
he
let
go
of
her
arm
look
we
re
both
tired
can
we
talk
about
this
tomorrow
fine
whatever
she
was
getting
out
of
the
car
when
her
foot
bumped
up
against
something
on
the
floor
the
box
of
teuscher
chocolates
she
d
meant
to
give
to
his
parents
with
the
excruciating
trip
to
rhinebeck
snatched
it
up
and
tucked
it
under
her
arm
just
as
well
they
did
nt
deserve
it
anyway
dashing
up
the
brownstone
steps
rain
mingling
with
the
tears
that
trickled
down
her
cheeks
she
thought
about
erin
the
days
when
they
d
console
each
other
with
chocolate
chip
cookies
and
ice
cream
in
times
of
heartbreak
jessie
could
nt
wait
to
call
her
just
talking
to
her
best
friend
would
make
her
feel
better
erin
s
perfect
marriage
shimmered
in
her
mind
s
eye
the
touchstone
that
had
been
a
constant
throughout
her
string
of
failed
relationships
reminding
her
that
such
happiness
did
exist
that
it
was
nt
just
in
fairy
tales
though
at
the
moment
it
seemed
unlikely
that
she
d
ever
find
it
jessie
trudged
up
to
the
third
floor
to
the
lush
strains
of
la
bohme
she
was
nt
alone
in
her
misery
it
seemed
clive
always
listened
to
puccini
when
nursing
a
broken
heart
she
unlocked
the
door
to
her
apartment
and
before
she
was
all
the
way
inside
meowing
piteously
jessie
picked
her
up
burying
her
face
in
delilah
s
thick
black
fur
thinking
at
least
someone
s
glad
to
see
me
glancing
about
she
took
in
the
marble
fireplace
and
parquet
floors
the
french
windows
that
opened
onto
the
street
below
telling
herself
how
lucky
she
was
to
have
this
place
that
she
could
be
living
in
a
dump
or
one
of
those
sterile
high
rises
where
you
d
get
a
nosebleed
going
up
in
the
elevator
but
tonight
there
was
no
consoling
herself
even
the
homey
touches
the
worn
oriental
rug
the
deep
sofa
with
its
scattering
of
bright
throw
cushions
the
fifties
atomic
lamp
an
oak
bookcase
displaying
her
collection
of
vintage
nancy
drew
titles
served
only
to
remind
her
that
she
had
no
one
to
share
it
with
she
sank
down
on
the
sofa
not
even
bothering
to
take
off
her
coat
which
was
probably
ruined
from
the
rain
delilah
leapt
off
her
lap
at
once
the
only
thing
she
hated
more
than
being
left
box
of
chocolates
and
pried
it
open
she
was
starving
after
having
choked
sometimes
the
speakers
seized
the
occasion
to
vent
their
own
grievances
they
often
identified
the
united
states
as
the
source
of
their
personal
troubles
a
college
graduate
of
dark
complexion
even
claimed
to
an
audience
of
eight
hundred
that
his
health
had
been
ruined
by
the
american
film
industry
because
he
had
how
to
masturbate
now
he
could
nt
control
himself
anymore
he
confessed
publicly
these
kinds
of
condemnations
high
and
low
boosted
the
morale
of
the
soldiers
who
grew
restless
eager
to
wipe
out
the
enemy
of
the
common
people
on
the
night
of
march
we
crossed
the
yalu
every
infantryman
carried
a
submachine
gun
two
hundred
rounds
of
ammunition
four
grenades
a
canteen
of
water
a
pair
of
rubber
sneakers
and
a
short
shovel
on
the
back
of
his
bedroll
and
a
tubed
sack
of
parched
wheat
flour
weighing
thirteen
pounds
we
walked
gingerly
on
the
eastern
bridge
because
the
western
one
was
partly
damaged
each
man
kept
ten
feet
from
the
one
in
front
of
him
the
water
below
was
dark
hissing
and
plunging
now
and
then
someone
would
cry
out
his
foot
having
fallen
through
a
hole
a
tall
mule
drawing
a
cart
got
its
hind
leg
stuck
in
a
rift
and
could
nt
dislodge
it
no
matter
how
madly
the
driver
thrashed
its
it
shook
then
keeled
over
and
fell
into
the
river
together
with
the
helpless
animal
there
was
a
great
splash
followed
by
an
elongated
whirlpool
in
the
shimmering
current
and
then
the
entire
load
of
medical
supplies
vanished
having
left
behind
our
insignias
and
ids
from
now
on
we
called
ourselves
the
chinese
people
s
volunteers
this
was
to
differentiate
us
from
the
army
back
home
so
that
china
nominally
having
not
sent
its
regular
troops
to
korea
might
avoid
a
full
blown
war
with
the
united
states
we
were
ordered
to
reach
within
fourteen
days
a
town
called
yichun
very
close
to
the
thirty
eighth
parallel
the
distance
was
about
four
hundred
miles
and
we
would
have
to
walk
all
the
way
it
was
early
spring
the
air
still
chilly
the
roads
were
muddy
soaked
by
thawing
ice
and
snow
hard
for
us
to
trudge
through
the
divisional
headquarters
had
two
jeeps
that
transported
the
leaders
and
their
staff
sometimes
the
jeeps
would
drop
off
the
officers
and
turn
no
longer
march
thanks
to
blisters
on
their
feet
i
walked
the
whole
time
except
for
once
when
commissar
pei
wanted
me
to
get
on
his
jeep
so
that
i
could
figure
out
the
meaning
of
the
english
words
on
a
folded
handbill
someone
had
picked
up
on
the
way
it
turned
out
to
be
the
menu
of
a
restaurant
in
seoul
which
must
have
served
americans
mainly
because
the
menu
was
only
in
english
i
could
nt
understand
all
the
words
but
could
roughly
describe
the
dishes
and
soups
to
pei
shan
the
entrees
included
broiled
flounder
filet
beef
steak
fried
chicken
meat
loaf
besides
the
commissar
s
orderly
a
clerical
officer
named
chang
ming
who
edited
our
division
s
bulletin
often
boarded
the
jeep
i
envied
him
for
that
whenever
we
stopped
somewhere
for
the
night
chang
ming
would
be
busy
interviewing
people
and
writing
articles
commissar
pei
seemed
a
born
optimist
he
often
laughed
heartily
jutting
his
chin
and
showing
his
buckteeth
he
looked
more
like
our
division
commander
niu
jinping
was
a
wisp
of
a
man
who
had
once
been
the
vice
director
of
the
political
department
of
the
sixty
second
army
i
often
saw
a
cunning
light
in
niu
s
round
eyes
in
his
presence
i
was
always
cautious
about
what
i
said
when
he
smiled
he
seldom
opened
his
lips
chuckling
through
his
nose
as
if
his
mouth
were
stuffed
with
food
he
was
a
chain
smoker
and
his
orderly
carried
a
whole
bag
of
brand
name
cigarettes
for
him
both
the
commander
and
the
commissar
were
in
their
early
thirties
and
neither
was
experienced
in
directing
battle
operations
back
in
dandong
city
i
had
nt
been
able
to
imagine
the
magnitude
of
the
war
s
destruction
now
to
my
horror
i
saw
that
most
villages
east
of
the
yalu
lay
in
ruins
the
land
looked
empty
with
at
least
four
fifths
of
the
houses
leveled
to
the
ground
the
standing
ones
were
mostly
deserted
most
of
the
korean
houses
were
shabby
with
thatched
hip
roofs
and
many
of
them
were
mere
huts
that
had
gaping
holes
as
windows
it
must
have
been
hard
to
farm
this
rugged
land
where
boulders
and
rocks
stuck
out
of
the
ground
everywhere
yet
it
seemed
every
scrap
of
tillable
soil
was
used
and
even
low
hills
were
terraced
with
small
patches
of
cropland
we
came
across
korean
civilians
from
time
to
time
most
of
them
were
in
rags
women
in
white
dresses
that
had
faded
into
yellow
and
old
men
wearing
black
top
hats
with
chin
straps
reminding
me
of
chinese
men
of
ancient
times
here
and
there
roads
had
been
cratered
and
teams
of
chinese
laborers
were
busy
filling
the
holes
carrying
earth
and
stones
with
wicker
baskets
affixed
to
a
frames
the
farther
south
we
went
the
fewer
houses
remained
intact
and
as
a
result
most
of
us
had
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
generally
during
the
day
it
was
nt
safe
for
us
to
march
because
american
planes
would
come
in
droves
to
attack
us
so
only
after
nightfall
town
the
air
raids
were
constant
and
sometimes
even
took
place
at
night
every
infantryman
carried
at
least
sixty
pounds
while
each
horse
was
loaded
with
five
times
more
without
enough
sleep
and
rest
the
troops
were
soon
footsore
and
exhausted
on
the
fifth
day
heavy
rain
set
in
and
made
it
impossible
for
us
to
lie
on
the
ground
to
sleep
some
officers
in
our
political
department
clustered
together
with
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
over
their
heads
many
men
too
tired
to
care
about
the
downpour
simply
put
their
bedrolls
on
the
ground
sat
on
and
a
blade
of
dread
sliced
through
her
heart
she
wanted
to
laugh
at
him
to
tell
him
he
was
addled
call
him
a
fool
but
she
held
her
tongue
did
he
not
know
who
she
was
who
her
father
was
did
he
not
heal
her
lame
horse
before
she
said
another
word
he
slipped
away
as
if
in
his
own
mist
through
the
curtain
of
rain
overhead
the
wings
of
a
great
owl
flapped
wildly
wait
she
cried
but
before
the
word
was
uttered
she
knew
he
was
gone
swallowing
hard
she
clucked
softly
to
the
horse
pulling
on
the
reins
as
she
led
the
beast
back
to
the
great
gates
of
dwyrain
the
man
was
mad
she
told
herself
not
to
be
trusted
an
imposter
who
performed
some
sort
of
trickery
but
no
matter
how
desperately
the
premonition
of
doom
that
trailed
after
her
as
unshakable
as
her
own
shadow
as
dark
as
the
deep
waters
of
hag
s
end
lake
tower
dwyrain
winter
come
now
smile
megan
t
is
your
wedding
day
ewan
cajoled
lying
on
the
bed
in
his
chamber
he
patted
the
white
fur
coverlet
and
smiled
up
at
his
daughter
even
in
the
flickering
light
from
the
candles
megan
saw
the
spots
of
age
on
his
thin
skin
and
noticed
that
his
once
fleshy
face
had
hollowed
in
his
youth
his
eyes
had
been
as
clear
and
blue
as
a
mountain
lake
but
now
they
had
clouded
leaving
him
half
blind
you
ll
not
have
to
look
after
me
much
longer
child
he
told
her
my
time
here
is
short
nay
father
she
said
closing
the
door
behind
her
and
hurrying
to
his
bedside
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
feather
mattress
and
took
his
cold
fingers
in
her
own
see
a
grandson
before
i
go
a
strong
strapping
lad
as
bevan
was
he
said
tears
welled
in
megan
s
eyes
when
she
thought
of
her
brother
a
year
older
than
she
but
now
in
his
grave
the
victim
of
the
sickness
that
had
taken
so
many
in
the
castle
including
her
mother
and
tiny
sister
megan
swallowed
against
a
thick
lump
that
had
formed
in
her
throat
she
d
heard
the
gossip
knew
that
most
of
the
servants
and
a
few
of
the
knights
blamed
her
for
the
death
and
destruction
that
had
befallen
dwyrain
ever
since
she
d
seen
the
lame
prophet
in
the
forest
and
he
d
cursed
her
as
well
as
the
castle
her
father
sighed
sadly
but
ye
d
best
not
wait
too
long
with
that
grandson
do
nt
talk
such
madness
she
chided
refusing
to
believe
that
her
beloved
father
would
soon
die
but
t
was
as
if
he
were
deaf
holt
he
will
be
a
good
husband
to
smiling
without
reason
as
if
he
had
no
mind
left
there
was
hushed
talk
between
his
men
that
he
was
addled
that
the
loss
of
his
wife
and
two
children
coupled
with
his
age
had
finally
caught
up
to
him
that
he
d
taken
one
too
many
blows
to
the
head
in
the
heat
of
battle
in
his
younger
years
a
lucky
lass
ye
be
to
marry
a
knight
as
brave
as
sir
holt
despair
raked
sharp
claws
down
her
heart
nay
father
she
said
boldly
knowing
this
was
her
last
chance
to
change
his
mind
do
not
argue
with
me
grasping
his
hand
more
urgently
she
whispered
but
father
i
need
not
a
husband
shh
he
said
then
coughed
loudly
his
chest
rattling
his
body
clenching
against
the
pain
god
in
heaven
he
growled
once
the
attack
had
passed
he
reached
for
a
mazer
of
wine
on
a
bedside
table
his
glared
at
megan
menacingly
as
if
she
were
the
reason
their
master
no
longer
rode
wildly
through
the
forests
and
underbrush
drinking
mead
whooping
loudly
and
flushing
out
deer
boars
and
pheasant
for
them
to
chase
beneath
the
dogs
yellow
eyed
glare
megan
inched
up
her
chin
even
the
snarling
beasts
appeared
to
blame
her
for
the
ills
that
had
plagued
dwyrain
ever
since
that
crippled
old
sorcerer
had
sealed
her
doom
with
his
prophecy
and
cayley
whom
megan
had
trusted
with
her
secret
had
told
the
story
of
the
curse
but
father
she
pressed
on
remember
the
magician
said
that
should
i
marry
this
man
of
your
choosing
the
marriage
would
be
cursed
and
shh
child
i
believe
not
in
such
devilment
ewan
grumbled
bellowing
as
he
once
had
only
to
end
up
in
a
deep
bone
jarring
hack
t
is
against
the
teachings
of
the
church
father
timothy
said
t
was
a
trick
the
cripple
weak
mind
my
mind
is
far
from
weak
megan
said
quickly
and
silently
cursed
the
priest
for
his
false
piety
the
man
was
too
swift
to
point
to
the
fault
in
others
too
hasty
to
give
a
tongue
lashing
too
eager
to
see
punishment
meted
out
when
none
was
needed
unlike
father
andrew
a
kind
and
wise
man
who
during
his
years
as
chapel
priest
at
dwyrain
had
always
seen
both
sides
of
a
disagreement
father
timothy
was
young
and
all
knowing
with
a
glint
of
pleasure
in
his
eye
when
anyone
was
caught
in
a
sin
t
was
as
if
he
enjoyed
watching
others
explain
their
sins
and
beg
forgiveness
aye
i
know
you
not
to
be
thick
skulled
as
father
timothy
proclaims
but
i
can
not
believe
in
witchcraft
and
the
dark
arts
what
would
your
mother
rest
her
soul
think
with
a
deft
movement
he
crossed
himself
as
he
sometimes
did
when
his
thoughts
turned
to
violet
and
her
early
death
he
d
forgotten
she
d
left
this
earth
i
know
not
well
i
ll
ask
her
the
next
time
she
comes
to
visit
he
said
and
she
looked
for
a
hint
of
humor
in
his
cloudy
eyes
but
found
none
nay
he
believed
that
his
wife
though
dead
walked
these
halls
and
that
she
often
carried
baby
rosalind
with
her
or
spoke
of
bevan

began
to
read
she
was
still
studying
water
depths
around
the
vessel
when
she
heard
a
light
tap
on
her
cabin
door
rach
jared
called
softly
it
s
unlocked
for
such
a
big
man
jared
could
move
quietly
when
he
wanted
to
rachel
barely
heard
him
enter
the
cabin
i
brought
you
a
sandwich
turkey
on
whole
wheat
a
little
mayo
a
little
lettuce
three
pickles
on
the
side
just
the
way
you
like
it
is
it
dinnertime
already
she
turned
to
look
up
at
him
jared
filled
the
space
of
the
small
doorway
he
wore
cutoff
shorts
and
an
old
tee
and
held
the
plastic
plate
out
to
her
as
a
peace
offering
rachel
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
it
would
take
a
stronger
soul
than
hers
to
remain
angry
with
jared
for
too
long
dinner
s
long
past
rach
it
s
almost
nine
she
rubbed
her
hand
on
the
back
of
her
neck
which
was
stiff
from
being
hunched
over
the
desk
for
several
hours
she
pointed
to
the
charts
and
said
i
ve
been
doing
a
little
light
reading
mind
if
i
take
a
look
help
yourself
she
lifted
a
stack
of
charts
and
said
we
ll
trade
i
get
the
food
you
get
the
charts
deal
he
handed
over
the
plate
took
the
sheaf
of
papers
from
her
hand
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bunk
hey
i
know
this
area
he
frowned
i
wonder
why
i
never
heard
of
the
melrose
i
was
wondering
that
myself
she
said
after
she
swallowed
a
bite
of
sandwich
i
ve
been
diving
in
those
waters
a
dozen
or
more
times
remember
the
first
time
we
dove
together
in
north
carolina
rachel
nodded
you
took
me
to
the
feet
underwater
and
sur
rounded
by
sand
tiger
sharks
not
the
type
of
thing
a
girl
forgets
i
thought
dad
was
going
to
kill
you
when
he
found
out
where
you
d
taken
me
rachel
took
another
bite
great
sandwich
by
the
way
thanks
jared
grinned
and
you
re
right
dad
had
a
fit
but
i
never
doubted
for
a
minute
that
you
could
make
that
dive
and
that
you
d
love
it
i
did
love
it
jared
once
i
realized
that
the
sharks
were
nt
going
to
eat
me
i
must
confess
that
i
had
a
few
antsy
minutes
there
at
first
sitting
on
the
ocean
floor
surrounded
by
a
school
of
mean
looking
carnivores
was
a
whole
new
experience
for
me
and
you
did
great
like
i
knew
you
would
convincing
dad
that
you
were
ready
had
nt
been
as
easy
dad
always
thought
of
me
as
this
helpless
little
girl
who
needed
someone
watching
after
her
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eyes
and
added
sometimes
i
think
you
do
too
no
jared
shook
his
head
no
i
know
better
and
in
his
heart
dad
does
too
you
know
i
think
he
was
really
torn
today
on
the
one
hand
i
think
he
was
afraid
that
you
d
lose
the
toss
on
the
other
i
think
he
was
afraid
you
would
nt
what
s
that
supposed
to
mean
that
dad
really
wants
you
with
him
on
the
true
wind
he
knows
that
s
what
s
right
it
s
your
ship
on
the
other
hand
he
is
nt
so
sure
that
i
can
handle
the
melrose
alone
ire
tinged
her
cheeks
with
a
hint
of
color
well
then
this
is
your
chance
to
prove
otherwise
is
nt
it
as
good
a
chance
as
i
ll
ever
get
if
there
s
anything
i
can
do
shoved
into
the
pockets
of
his
cutoff
jeans
yeah
i
know
where
to
find
you
she
nodded
and
smiled
weakly
hav
e
you
decided
if
you
ll
take
someone
from
our
crew
i
really
hate
to
do
that
jared
all
of
dad
s
men
are
psyched
for
the
true
wind
i
d
hate
to
take
any
one
of
them
off
the
job
and
i
do
nt
know
that
i
ll
need
an
extra
diver
dad
said
that
winter
already
has
a
couple
of
divers
and
you
said
the
archaeologist
sam
mcgowan
yes
you
said
he
was
a
good
diver
he
s
excellent
well
that
makes
four
counting
me
enough
for
two
sets
of
partners
i
do
nt
see
where
we
ll
need
more
than
that
for
this
job
judging
from
the
information
i
ve
read
tonight
i
think
the
true
wind
is
more
likely
to
need
the
rest
of
the
crew
if
you
ll
send
someone
out
if
need
be
jared
grinned
again
hell
if
things
get
slow
around
here
i
ll
come
for
a
day
or
two
myself
i
may
just
take
you
up
on
that
rachel
stood
and
handed
her
brother
the
empty
plate
thanks
for
dinner
jared
i
appreciate
the
gesture
as
well
as
the
food
well
i
ca
nt
have
you
skipping
meals
and
fading
bite
and
a
big
swig
the
sweet
pulpy
taste
mixing
into
the
glutinous
sticky
mouthful
she
did
nt
finish
swallowing
before
taking
another
huge
bite
maybe
i
ll
be
a
fat
person
in
my
new
life
she
started
to
laugh
and
the
peanut
butter
bread
orange
juice
clump
stuck
momentarily
in
her
throat
cutting
off
her
airway
she
imagined
indifferently
choking
and
dying
in
this
motel
room
she
swallowed
and
then
laughed
even
harder
out
loud
it
sounded
crazy
her
short
sudden
laugh
against
the
quiet
mono
sound
of
the
television
she
could
hear
her
breath
squeeze
in
and
out
of
her
lungs
and
throat
she
turned
up
the
volume
on
the
television
and
stared
hard
at
it

would

that
she
almost
waited
for

to

her
but
she
knew
he
would
not
not
for
a
while
anyway
at
eleven
o
clock
she
turned
the
channel
to
watch
the
news
tried
to
see
if
he
or
any
of
them
had
been
identified
or
arrested

bobby
had
said
they
sat
cross
legged
on
a
handwoven
rug
bobby
had
bought
in
spain
she
spent
many
nights
getting
high
kneeling
on
that
rug
she
could
examine
it
endlessly
moorish
mbius
patterns
took
you
in
dervish
circles
back
to
where
you
started
but
done
in
incongruous
rainy
european
colors
muted
greens
and
yellows
next
to
imperial
regal
and
regimental
looking
banners
and
shieldlike
things
the
rug
was
nt
authentic
but
whoever
made
it
had
worked
meticulously
to
evoke
something
authentic
studied
relics
of
conquerings
exiles
and
colonies
it
clashed
and
conflicted
the
way
real
things
often
did
it
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
either
of
them
possessed
and
they
often
sat
on
it
next
to
their
bed
which
was
just
a
mattress
on
the
floor
with
no
frame
or
even
box
springs
all
the
kids
she
knew
slept
on
the
floor
it
softened
the
distinction
between
their
bed
and
the
rest
of
the
world
she
felt
safer
nearer
to
the
people
sit
cross
legged
on
the
floor
on
beautiful
rugs
were
there
horizontal
and
vertical
cultures
was
living
closer
to
the
earth
free
and
natural
or
was
it
simply
meager
was
it
good
or
better
or
just
different
for
someone
and
what
will
you
call
me
she
had
asked
leaning
her
head
against
his
back
he
often
wore
sleeveless
undershirts
very
thin
and
slightly
ribbed
when
she
pressed
against
him
he
smelled
both
tangy
and
sweet
pot
and
incense
and
sweat
she
tried
to
conjure
him
with
her
eyes
closed
in
her
midnight
bed
she
thought
bobby
looked
exotic
handsome
not
so
much
in
the
total
as
in
the
details
the
closer
in
she
was
the
more
attractive
he
became
his
skin
had
a
faint
yellow
green
undertone
that
was
the
opposite
of
ruddy
skin
so
smooth
under
her
touch
that
she
could
feel
every
tiny
rough
spot
on
her
own
fingers
or
lips
skin
so
clear
and
fine
she
could
see
his
blood
pulse
at
wrist
ever
crazy
about
the
random
curliness
of
his
long
black
hair
which
grew
out
rather
than
down
she
adored
the
silky
way
the
hair
slipped
through
her
fingers
when
she
pulled
her
hand
through
it
and
the
tension
in
his
shoulders
when
she
pressed
against
them
and
how
in
candlelight
she
would
see
her
white
skin
her
slender
hand
say
against
the
dark
skin
of
his
broad
back
and
it
would
catch
her
off
guard
always
the
contrast
between
them
she
felt
then
exquisite
and
even
fragile
which
she
liked
she
was
nt
supposed
to
but
she
did
perhaps
because
they
spent
so
much
time
together
and
dressed
alike
and
spoke
alike
even
laughed
alike
it
was
great
to
in
some
palpable
way
be
unalike
will
you
call
me
mary
at
least
when
we
are
home
in
bed
only
freya
and
you
have
to
call
me
marco
in
these
sorts
of
activities
you
ca
nt
use
your
real
name
ever
if
you
want
to
change
your
life
nom
de
guerre
is
nt
that
sort
of
ridiculous
all
cultures
have
naming
ceremonies
you
have
a
given
name
but
then
you
get
a
chosen
name
it
s
part
of
a
transformation
to
adulthood
they
tell
you
who
you
are
and
then
you
decide
who
you
are
it
s
like
getting
confirmed
or
getting
married
but
i
did
nt
choose
that
name
you
did
i
m
helping
you
the
first
thing
we
do
is
make
up
a
new
name
a
fighting
fearless
name
a
bolshevik
name
mary
said
frowning
it
s
a
nordic
goddess
name
a
towering
priestess
name
a
lightning
bolt
name
a
name
to
live
up
to
she
closed
her
eyes
and
rested
against
him
okay
a
name
that
exudes
agitprop
these
are
always
two
syllable
names
that
end
in
a
vowel
freya
maya
silda
marco
proto
demo
if
you
do
nt
like
never
did
use
those
names
except
in
the
press
communiqus
and
on
the
telephone
now
she
was
choosing
another
name
its
opposite
a
hidden
modest
meek
name
but
truly
choosing
the
next
morning
was
it
morning
when
she
woke
after
hardly
sleeping
she
sat
down
in
the
one
chair
a
molded
plastic
affair
in
mustard
yellow
next
dislike
but
there
was
going
to
be
law
and
order
on
doyers
street
poor
ah
hoon
did
nt
even
want
to
do
his
act
man
he
wanted
to
take
the
next
train
out
of
town
but
the
cops
and
the
on
leong
made
him
take
the
stage
that
night
they
had
something
to
prove
he
did
nt
but
he
waited
in
the
wings
and
sweated
through
the
acrobats
leaping
over
each
other
he
agonized
through
the
singer
s
songs
trying
to
peer
into
the
darkness
to
see
where
the
bullet
or
knife
or
hatchet
was
going
to
come
from
he
probably
came
close
to
having
a
heart
attack
every
time
the
gas
lamps
sputtered
and
popped
downstage
but
all
the
time
the
cops
and
the
on
leong
men
reassured
him
that
all
would
be
well
he
was
protected
he
would
live
can
you
imagine
anyone
having
a
better
reason
to
have
stage
fright
than
poor
ah
hoon
he
walked
out
onstage
that
night
and
the
first
person
he
saw
front
and
center
was
mock
duck
grinning
up
at
him
but
there
were
the
american
police
to
the
left
and
right
of
his
mortal
enemy
ah
hoon
took
a
and
dove
into
his
act
he
did
nt
change
a
word
and
by
all
accounts
he
was
very
very
funny
that
night
even
mock
duck
laughed
at
the
impersonation
when
it
was
time
for
the
curtain
call
the
police
swept
him
offstage
before
his
first
bow
and
an
encore
was
out
of
the
question
the
point
had
been
made
ah
hoon
had
survived
the
performance
well
the
on
leong
men
went
wild
that
night
fireworks
exploded
in
the
sky
over
chinatown
their
brightness
dimmed
somewhat
by
the
eerie
fog
hip
sing
men
were
burned
in
effigy
and
humiliated
in
songs
and
jeers
to
the
on
leong
men
the
survival
of
ah
hoon
had
proven
that
the
hip
sing
were
no
longer
the
threat
they
had
once
posed
and
that
the
war
was
won
meanwhile
the
cops
hustled
ah
hoon
to
a
cheap
room
in
a
cheap
hotel
next
to
the
theater
they
had
rented
it
just
to
ensure
that
nothing
would
happen
to
tarnish
their
reputation
as
protectors
of
the
weak
and
innocent
everyone
on
the
floor
used
the
same
washroom
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
the
other
apartments
along
the
hall
had
been
cleared
of
occupants
for
the
night
did
nt
matter
if
they
had
paid
in
advance
lived
there
for
years
or
had
no
place
else
to
go
they
were
rousted
there
were
no
closets
in
the
room
but
several
small
cupboards
there
was
a
bed
there
was
one
window
but
it
had
been
jammed
into
a
stuck
position
for
years
a
two
inch
gap
let
a
little
air
into
the
stuffy
room
but
the
window
could
be
neither
forced
open
wider
nor
lowered
more
three
stories
down
was
a
dead
end
alleyway
barely
the
width
of
a
broad
shouldered
man
three
cops
were
positioned
at
its
mouth
preventing
any
entrance
opposite
the
window
about
three
feet
away
was
the
solid
brick
wall
of
a
building
that
particular
side
was
unmarred
by
a
single
door
or
window
featureless
and
rising
another
four
stories
beyond
ah
hoon
s
floor
cops
on
foot
hotel
ten
officers
stood
in
the
hallway
outside
ah
hoon
s
room
a
big
swede
cop
of
impeccable
moral
fiber
at
least
of
no
discernible
vice
was
placed
before
ah
hoon
s
door
an
hour
after
sunrise
the
chief
of
police
led
a
phalanx
of
reporters
photographers
reformers
and
politicians
past
the
few
remaining
on
leong
revelers
into
the
hotel
up
to
the
third
floor
down
the
line
of
ten
cops
standing
at
attention
and
up
to
the
big
swede
the
chief
of
police
himself
proudly
opened
the
door
to
introduce
ah
hoon
to
the
rest
of
his
life
and
announce
to
the
world
that
the
resolve
of
the
hip
sing
tong
had
been
broken
and
that
peace
would
reign
forever
and
for
all
time
in
chinatown
the
bullet
hole
had
made
a
perfect
dot
in
the
center
of
ah
hoon
s
forehead
giving
the
appearance
of
a
third
eye
he
sat
cross
legged
on
his
bed
stiff
and
cold
in
a
pool
of
his
own
drying
blood
legend
has
it
was
the
touch
of
a
demon
flies
were
already
buzzing
curiously
about
his
head
which
faced
the
single
window
still
opposite
a
solid
brick
wall
still
jammed
at
less
than
two
inches
open
and
as
the
chief
of
police
roared
his
outrage
and
the
flashbulbs
popped
and
as
the
word
spread
through
chinatown
like
a
flash
fire
that
the
sweet
flower
war
was
over
and
the
hip
sing
not
the
on
leong
had
won
and
as
an
entirely
new
celebration
began
the
wide
eyed
expression
on
ah
hoon
s
face
seemed
to
say
one
simple
thing
now
that
s
funny
gibson
closed
his
fist
around
the
tin
stallion
and
reopened
it
it
had
vanished
the
winds
changed
that
morning
and
after
months
of
coldly
clinging
to
every
nail
and
stone
and
board
the
chinatown
death
cloud
rolled
back
out
to
sea
and
vanished
as
completely
as
the
life
from
ah
hoon
s
body
he
closed
his
fingers
into
a
fist
again
and
then
opened
them
suddenly
a
fresh
cigarette
two
fingers
a
simple
french
drop
with
a
flourish
for
dramatic
punctuation
his
tale
was
told
he
inhaled
the
smoke
deeply
and
waited
for
the
reaction
he
could
tell
a
lot
about
a
fella
by
the
way
he
reacted
to
a
story
or
a
magic
trick
they
either
bought
it
did
nt
or
tried
to
find
some
little
flaw
that
could
let
them
feel
like
they
had
nt
been
conned
into
enjoying
it
when
they
really
had
he
figured
hubbard
for
the
last
type
the
cops
were
in
on
it
gibson
was
right
they
were
nt
and
you
forgot
what
i
asked
in
the
first
place
he
reminded
hubbard
the
booze
making
him
sound
more
arrogant
than
explanation
i
uh
gary
minton
started
the
years
had
been
kind
to
him
and
he
was
still
a
handsome
man
with
his
dark
hair
with
just
a
touch
of
gray
at
the
temples
and
his
dark
brows
he
looked
much
younger
than
he
was
we
take
care
of
our
own
said
his
wife
from
beside
him
it
was
as
though
the
years
gary
s
face
did
nt
carry
were
etched
on
his
wife
s
sun
cigarettes
and
wind
had
weathered
her
skin
so
she
looked
like
a
dried
up
mummy
you
do
nt
mind
if
we
re
here
do
you
bell
said
in
a
purring
voice
to
the
lawyer
both
twins
were
wearing
micro
miniskirts
their
famous
long
legs
stretched
out
until
they
nearly
touched
his
desk
waist
mr
johnson
glanced
at
them
over
his
half
glasses
and
gave
a
bit
of
a
frown
he
seemed
to
want
to
tell
them
to
put
their
clothes
on
he
looked
back
at
jocelyn
noted
her
plain
black
suit
with
the
crisp
white
blouse
under
it
the
pearls
around
her
neck
and
gave
a
little
smile
if
miss
jocelyn
approves
you
may
remain
oh
la
tee
da
ash
said
miss
jocelyn
miss
college
educated
jocelyn
will
you
read
a
book
to
us
i
m
sure
someone
will
have
to
jocelyn
said
without
taking
her
eyes
off
the
lawyer
they
can
stay
they
ll
find
out
everything
anyway
all
right
then
he
looked
down
at
the
papers
basically
edilean
harcourt
left
you
jocelyn
minton
everything
and
how
much
is
that
bell
asked
quickly
mr
johnson
turned
to
her
it
s
not
tells
you
is
her
concern
but
i
will
say
nothing
now
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
have
work
to
do
he
picked
up
a
brown
paper
string
tied
folder
and
handed
it
across
the
desk
to
jocelyn
all
the
information
is
in
there
and
you
may
look
through
the
documents
in
your
own
time
when
he
remained
standing
joce
also
stood
thank
you
she
said
as
she
took
the
portfolio
i
ll
read
it
later
i
would
suggest
that
you
read
it
when
you
re
alone
in
privacy
edilean
wrote
some
things
that
i
think
she
meant
only
for
you
to
see
everything
to
her
ash
asked
at
last
understanding
what
had
been
said
but
what
about
us
we
used
to
visit
the
old
woman
all
the
time
mr
johnson
s
old
face
moved
into
a
bit
of
a
smile
how
could
i
have
forgotten
he
took
drawer
in
his
desk
she
left
these
for
you
he
held
out
two
small
blue
satin
bags
and
the
contents
looked
to
be
bumpy
as
though
they
contained
jewels
oooooh
bell
and
ash
said
in
unison
for
us
why
that
darling
she
should
nt
have
we
really
did
nt
expect
anything
with
their
much
photographed
faces
alight
they
opened
the
bags
then
looked
up
at
the
lawyer
in
consternation
what
are
these
ash
dumped
the
contents
of
her
bag
into
the
palm
of
her
hand
there
were
about
twenty
small
black
objects
some
of
which
had
been
emerald
cut
some
in
the
round
diamond
shape
what
are
they
i
ve
never
seen
stones
like
these
before
are
they
black
diamonds
bell
asked
in
a
way
they
are
mr
johnson
said
then
still
smiling
he
started
for
the
door
but
he
paused
with
he
gave
jocelyn
a
wink
then
he
left
the
room
joce
had
to
work
to
keep
a
straight
face
the
black
diamonds
that
miss
edi
had
left
for
the
stepsisters
were
actually
pieces
of
coal
she
did
nt
say
a
word
as
they
left
the
offices
she
sat
in
the
back
of
the
car
on
the
drive
home
and
listened
as
bell
and
ash
sitting
beside
her
held
the
pieces
of
coal
up
to
the
light
and
exclaimed
over
their
beauty
and
discussed
how
they
were
going
to
have
them
set
joce
looked
out
the
window
to
hide
her
smile
the
joke
that
miss
edi
had
left
her
jealous
greedy
stepsisters
lumps
of
coal
made
her
miss
her
friend
with
a
painful
longing
miss
edi
had
been
mother
grandmother
friend
and
mentor
all
in
one
joce
glanced
up
and
saw
her
father
frowning
at
her
in
the
rearview
mirror
she
could
see
that
he
knew
what
the
stones
were
and
he
was
dreading
the
coming
fury
mind
she
planned
to
be
gone
long
before
the
steps
discovered
what
the
black
stones
were
her
bags
were
packed
and
in
the
back
of
her
car
and
as
soon
as
they
got
home
she
was
going
back
to
her
job
at
the
university
only
when
jocelyn
was
back
at
school
and
in
her
tiny
apartment
did
she
open
the
packet
that
contained
miss
edi
s
will
she
d
tried
to
steel
herself
for
what
she
d
find
but
nothing
prepared
her
to
see
an
envelope
with
that
beloved
handwriting
on
it
to
my
jocelyn
it
said
on
the
envelope
with
trembling
hands
she
opened
it
pulled
out
the
letter
and
began
to
read
my
dear
dear
jocelyn
i
promise
i
wo
nt
be
maudlin
i
do
nt
know
if
it
s
been
days
or
months
since
my
demise
but
knowing
your
soft
heart
you
re
probably
still
grieving
i
know
all
too
well
what
it
is
to
lose
people
you
love
i
ve
had
to
die
i
was
very
nearly
the
last
one
left
now
to
business
the
house
in
boca
is
not
mine
nor
is
most
of
the
furniture
by
now
i
m
sure
the
contents
have
been
moved
out
and
put
up
for
auction
but
do
nt
worry
my
dear
the
best
of
what
i
owned
meaning
everything
that
i
took
from
edilean
manor
will
go
back
to
where
it
came
from
jocelyn
put
the
letter
down
edilean
manor
she
said
aloud
she
d
never
heard
of
the
place
after
her
initial
confusion
a
feeling
of
betrayal
ran
through
her
she
d
spent
a
great
deal
of
her
life
with
miss
edi
had
traveled
and
he
went
down
son
of
a
bitch
i
yelled
then
this
other
guy
the
thirteenth
guy
comes
crashing
right
into
me
even
with
all
that
was
going
on
i
thought
drug
addict
he
was
pale
and
sweaty
stank
like
raw
sewage
and
had
a
glazed
bug
eyed
stare
sick
bastard
even
tried
to
bite
me
but
the
kevlar
pads
on
my
sleeve
saved
my
gun
arm
get
off
i
screamed
and
gave
him
an
overhand
left
that
should
have
dropped
him
but
all
it
did
was
shake
him
loose
he
blundered
past
me
toward
one
of
the
other
guys
on
my
team
who
was
blocking
the
door
i
figured
he
was
making
for
that
sweet
cigarette
outside
so
i
pivoted
and
parked
two
in
his
back
quick
and
easy
blood
sprayed
the
walls
and
he
hit
the
deck
and
skidded
five
feet
before
coming
to
rest
in
a
motionless
sprawl
against
the
back
door
i
spun
back
into
the
room
and
laid
down
cover
fire
so
i
could
pull
jerry
behind
the
table
he
was
still
breathing
the
with
automatic
fire
i
heard
gunfire
coming
from
a
different
part
of
the
warehouse
and
peeled
off
from
the
pack
to
see
what
was
happening
found
a
trio
of
hostiles
in
a
nice
shooting
blind
laying
down
a
lot
of
fire
at
one
of
the
other
teams
i
popped
a
few
of
them
with
the
last
couple
of
rounds
in
my
mag
and
dealt
with
the
third
hand
to
hand
and
suddenly
the
whole
thing
was
over
in
the
end
eleven
alleged
terrorists
were
shot
six
fatally
including
the
cowboy
with
the
chinese
assault
rifle
guy
and
the
biter
i
nailed
in
the
back
who
according
to
his
id
was
named
javad
mustapha
we
d
just
started
going
through
id
s
when
a
bunch
of
federal
types
in
unmarked
black
fatigues
came
in
and
stole
the
show
kicking
everyone
else
out
onto
the
street
that
was
okay
with
me
i
wanted
to
check
on
jerry
turned
out
that
none
of
our
team
was
killed
though
eight
of
them
needed
treatment
mostly
for
broken
ribs
kevlar
stops
jerry
had
a
cracked
sternum
and
was
one
hurting
pup
the
emts
had
him
on
a
gurney
but
he
was
awake
enough
to
wave
me
over
before
they
took
him
away
how
you
feeling
dude
i
asked
squatting
next
to
him
old
and
sore
but
tell
you
whatsteal
me
that
cigarette
boat
and
i
ll
be
feeling
young
and
spry
sounds
like
a
plan
i
ll
get
right
on
that
pops
he
ticked
his
chin
toward
my
arm
hey
how
s
your
arm
the
emt
said
that
fruitcake
bit
you
nah
did
nt
even
break
the
skin
i
showed
him
just
a
bad
bruise
they
took
jerry
away
and
i
started
answering
questions
some
of
them
for
the
feds
in
the
unmarked
bdus
javad
had
nt
been
armed
and
i
d
drilled
him
in
the
back
so
there
would
be
a
routine
investigation
but
my
lieutenant
told
me
it
was
a
no
brainer
so
why
was
i
in
a
car
with
three
feds
they
were
nt
talking
so
i
sat
back
and
waited
chapter
four
easton
maryland
saturday
june
am
they
put
me
in
a
room
that
had
a
table
two
chairs
and
a
big
picture
window
with
a
drawn
curtain
an
interrogation
room
though
the
sign
outside
had
read
baylor
records
storage
we
were
somewhere
in
easton
off
route
more
than
seventy
miles
from
where
they
d
picked
me
up
bucket
head
told
me
to
sit
can
i
have
a
drink
of
water
he
ignored
me
and
left
locking
the
door
it
was
nearly
two
hours
before
anyone
came
in
i
did
nt
kick
up
a
fuss
i
knew
this
routine
park
someone
in
an
empty
room
and
leave
them
to
stew
doubt
and
a
guilty
conscience
can
do
a
lot
when
you
re
alone
i
did
nt
have
a
guilty
conscience
and
so
after
i
did
a
visual
on
the
room
i
went
into
my
own
head
and
waited
reviewing
the
number
of
thong
bikinis
i
d
seen
i
was
pretty
sure
the
count
was
twenty
two
and
of
those
at
least
eighteen
had
a
legal
and
moral
right
to
wear
a
thong
it
was
a
good
day
at
the
beach
the
guy
who
finally
came
in
was
big
very
well
dressed
maybe
sixty
but
there
was
no
trace
of
middle
age
soft
about
him
not
that
he
looked
especially
hard
not
like
a
muscle
freak
or
a
career
d
i
no
he
just
looked
capable
you
pay
attention
to
guys
like
him
he
took
a
seat
opposite
me
he
wore
a
dark
blue
suit
red
tie
white
shirt
and
tinted
glasses
that
made
it
hard
to
read
his
eyes
probably
on
purpose
he
had
short
hair
big
hands
and
no
expression
at
all
bucket
head
came
in
with
a
cork
restaurant
tray
on
which
was
a
pitcher
of
water
two
glasses
it
was
the
cookies
that
weirded
me
out
you
generally
do
nt
get
cookies
in
situations
like
this
and
it
had
to
be
some
kind
of
mind
trick
when
bucket
head
left
the
guy
in
the
suit
said
my
name
is
mr
church
okay
i
said
you
are
detective
joseph
edwin
ledger
baltimore
police
age
unmarried
you
trying
to
fix
me
up
with
your
daughter
you
served
forty
five
months
with
the
army
honorably
discharged
during
your
time
in
service
you
were
involved
in
no
significant
military
actions
or
operations
nothing
was
happening
while
i
was
in
the
service
at
least
not
in
my
part
of
the
world
and
yet
your
commanding
officers
and
particularly
your
sergeant
in
basic
wrote
glowingly
of
you
why
is
that
he
was
nt
reading
out
of
a
folder
he
had
no
papers
with
him
at
all
his
shaded
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
as
maybe
i
suck
up
nicely
no
he
said
you
do
nt
have
a
cookie
he
nudged
the
plate
my

a

a

ground
all
excess
elements
of
living
trimmed
away
like
the
hair
of
the
mothers
for
the
sake
of
creating
and
raising
babies
and
maintaining
the
health
physical
safety
and
education
of
all
and
little
else
is
of
value
if
it
is
not
work
or
school
or
doctor
appointments
off
union
mill
road
there
are
four
entrances
into
little
rocky
run
at
each
a
rock
with
a
plaque
attached
to
it
and
the
words
little
rocky
run
engraved
in
curvy
script
and
the
image
of
what
looks
like
the
side
of
a
mountain
you
refer
to
where
you
live
by
which
entrance
you
use
the
first
entrance
the
third
entrance
technically
the
numbers
are
wrong
as
there
is
an
entrance
before
the
first
entrance
but
for
some
reason
no
one
counts
this
entrance
the
first
entrance
is
where
the
oldest
homes
of
little
rocky
run
are
and
also
the
cheapest
and
smallest
the
fourth
entrance
contains
the
prefab
quasi
manors
approaching
the
million
dollar
mark
already
in
braddock
park
high
school
sits
across
from
the
first
entrance
on
the
other
side
of
union
mill
road
backing
into
braddock
park
and
twin
lakes
golf
course
it
has
three
thousand
students
in
trailer
classrooms
crowd
the
grounds
like
mold
growth
when
it
s
autumn
and
perfect
like
tonight
and
the
trees
are
bare
you
can
see
the
high
school
from
the
elementary
school
there
are
two
swimming
pools
in
little
rocky
run
not
counting
the
smaller
one
by
the
town
houses
which
is
where
the
uncounted
true
first
entrance
is
and
where
the
homes
were
first
built
and
are
sold
most
cheaply
there
are
seventeen
tennis
courts
in
little
rocky
run
this
is
the
only
tot
lot
that
has
pools
does
have
a
basketball
court
how
many
tot
lots
there
are
in
total
no
one
can
know
for
sure
their
numbers
and
nature
are
forever
in
flux
they
are
like
the
stars
above
you
this
tot
lot
is
in
the
third
entrance
the
fathers
are
in
the
military
they
are
here
because
the
army
the
air
force
has
stationed
them
to
one
of
the
countless
government
offices
scattered
around
northern
virginia
far
enough
away
from
one
another
that
no
single
bomb
or
missile
would
wipe
all
of
them
out
the
cia
headquarters
in
langley
the
pentagon
in
arlington
several
others
unmarked
and
unknown
these
are
greige
ziggurats
of
bureaucracy
and
secrecy
fifteen
miles
east
is
foxstone
park
in
vienna
where
the
spy
robert
hanssen
who
works
with
some
of
these
fathers
in
the
fbi
meets
his
kgb
handler
with
a
briefcase
of
documents
most
fathers
make
the
commute
every
morning
with
seldom
more
than
a
vague
emotion
of
complaint
men
and
women
of
duty
the
fathers
who
are
not
military
are
civilian
contractors
in
the
research
of
the
design
of
weapons
systems
develop
fuel
cells
and
the
technology
of
military
action
or
they
work
for
mobil
in
a
middle
management
capacity
transferred
to
that
entity
s
corporate
offices
or
they
are
at
aol
in
dulles
they
are
here
because
of
work
work
is
why
they
breathe
this
air
the
mothers
are
brilliant
too
they
have
large
butts
and
short
hair
and
wear
jeans

with

i
ve
been
less
interested

more
interested
in

mostly
studying

but
each
morning
like
this
one
there
is
just
me
the
generations
below
me
are
silent
and
the
tour
buses
have
not
yet
rumbled
in
in
the
half
light
the
site
is
empty
i
cross
the
museum
parking
lot
and
begin
to
climb
the
tell
the
land
is
perfectly
still
and
mute
secret
gardens
when
i
dig
my
callused
hands
into
the
cool
predawn
earth
i
feel
all
of
her
richness
tingle
through
my
skin
before
dawn
the
land
always
seems
to
yield
hinting
that
with
just
the
right
touch
everything
dormant
in
her
might
awaken
push
through
its
black
chambers
and
ezekiel
s
field
of

would
drink
the
moist
sky
i
walk
through
the
remains
of
solomon
s
stables
the
rows
of
dark
cold
arches
i
imagine
the
din
of
whinnying
and
neighing
echoing
through
the
ancient
hall
sparse
thorny
grasses
and
sharp
foliage
poke
through
the
stones
as
i
emerge
from
the
maze
of
stables
the
horizon
wears
a
crown
the
sun
is
just
rising
i
kneel
beside
my
most
recent
project
the
three
thousand
and
seventy
second
infant
burial
jar
we
ve
unearthed
i
put
down
my
knapsack
and
unroll
my
pack
of
tools
a
small
pickax
a
toothbrush
variously
sized
paintbrushes
and
fine
dental
tools
the
jar
is
shaped
like
a
womb
disappointing
for
them
to
be
delivered
not
by
some
messiah
to
life
everlasting
but
by
me
to
a
mention
in
my
field
notes
i
begin
to
gently
dust
the
rim
of
the
jar
thinking
it
is
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
i
am
thirty
nine
years
old
looking
at
the
swollen
shape
of
the
jar
i
involuntarily
draw
my
hand
over
my
stomach
i
used
to
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
round
and
full
like
that
instead
of
empty
flat
to
carry
life
inside
me
i
do
nt
think
about
it
much
anymore
i
have
never
gotten
myself
tested
to
see
if
i
have
the
lou
gehrig
s
gene
like
my
father
like
my
grandfather
i
tremble
at
the
thought
of
bequeathing
my
fear
to
another
if
not
my
child
then
his
or
hers
a
damocles
sword
over
all
my
generations
and
at
the
same
time
i
sigh
the
sky
that
had
sagged
so
sweetly
as
if
the
kingdom
of
heaven
s
doormat
was
just
within
thumbtack
i
labor
over
the
jar
and
its
crumbled
contents
you
would
be
i
d
estimate
three
thousand
years
old
today
i
say
some
scholars
have
written
that
these
are
the
remains
of
child
sacrifices
from
an
ancient
cult
it
s
possible
i
shrug
to
myself
infant
mortality
rates
were
astronomically
high
still
are
in
many
places
i
do
nt
know
i
say
out
loud
to
no
one
either
way
you
probably
were
nt
going
to
make
it
to
your
three
thousandth
birthday
anyhow
i
begin
to
hear
the
buzz
of
insects
as
the
sun
climbs
doing
their
jobs
as
well
diggers
are
beginning
to
arrive
soon
my
team
will
assemble
and
i
ll
direct
them
i
pull
out
my
notebook
and
lean
in
close
to
the
jar
sketching
the
details
the
early
bird
gets
the
urn
eh
i
sit
back
norris
is
standing
over
me
eclipsing
the
sun
i
squint
a
little
he
s
my
note
he
asks
tilting
his
head
i
remember
the
crumpled
page
of
my
book
tacked
to
the
door
and
the
plume
of
heat
it
fueled
in
me
i
used
to
stew
over
his
mockery
for
days
i
wonder
for
a
moment
if
the
fact
that
i
ve
started
to
become
used
to
it
that
i
can
recover
so
quickly
is
a
bad
sign
a
sign
i
ve
accepted
abuse
as
the
norm
it
was
nt
always
this
way
norris
my
professor
of
levantine
archaeology
at
columbia
had
been
a
great
supporter
of
my
first
book
body
of
water
body
of
air
water
and
theology
in
ancient
israel
my
second
book
up
in
smoke
was
based
on
my
thesis
a
study
of
cultic
theology
and
connections
between
altars
found
in
israel
especially
at
megiddo
and
altars
found
throughout
the
middle
east
tracing
borrowed
cultic
practices
throughout
the
region
the
new
manuscript
upon
this
altar
was
a
follow
up
to
up
in
smoke
i
did
altars
that
i
began
to
see
them
everywhere
mecca
ad
i
was
born
in
blood
and
its
terrible
taint
would
follow
me
all
my
life
my
mother
umm
ruman
cried
out
in
agony
as
the
contractions
increased
in
severity
the
midwife
a
stout
woman
from
the
tribe
of
bani
nawfal
named
amal
leaned
closer
to
examine
the
pregnant
woman
s
abdomen
and
then
she
saw
it
the
line
of
blood
that
was
running
down
her
patient
s
thigh
amal
looked
over
to
the
young
girl
standing
nervously
to
the
side
of
the
wooden
birthing
chair
where
her
stepmother
was
struggling
to
bring
forth
life
asma
she
said
in
a
soft
voice
trying
to
mask
the
fear
that
was
growing
in
her
chest
get
your
father
your
mother
abdallah
was
no
more
than
ten
years
old
at
the
time
and
she
paled
at
amal
s
words
asma
knew
what
they
meant
so
did
umm
ruman
i
am
dying
umm
ruman
had
known
something
was
wrong
the
moment
her
water
broke
it
had
been
dark
and
mottled
with
blood
and
the
subsequent
horror
of
the
contractions
was
far
beyond
anything
she
had
experienced
at
the
birth
of
her
son
abdal
kaaba
so
many
years
before
at
the
age
of
thirty
eight
she
had
known
that
she
was
too
old
to
bear
another
child
safely
and
had
greeted
the
news
of
her
pregnancy
with
trepidation
in
the
days
of
ignorance
before
the
revelation
perhaps
she
would
have
turned
to
amal
or
the
other
midwives
of
mecca
for
their
secret
draft
that
was
said
to
poison
the
womb
but
the
messenger
of
god
had
made
it
clear
to
his
small
band
of
followers
that
the
life
of
a
child
was
sacred
despite
the
many
pagan
arab
customs
to
the
contrary
she
had
sworn
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
his
hand
and
she
would
not
go
against
his
teachings
even
if
they
meant
her
demise
unlike
most
of
her
neighbors
and
friends
still
clinging
to
the
old
ways
umm
ruman
that
her
child
the
first
to
be
born
into
the
new
faith
of
islam
might
not
survive
to
see
the
sunrise
amal
took
her
hand
and
squeezed
it
gently
do
not
despair
we
will
get
through
this
together
her
voice
was
kind
but
umm
ruman
could
see
in
the
stern
lines
around
her
mouth
that
amal
had
reached
her
professional
conclusion
the
end
was
nigh
for
mother
and
child
umm
ruman
managed
to
turn
her
head
to
her
stepdaughter
asma
who
stood
frozen
at
her
side
tears
welling
in
her
dark
eyes
go
bring
abu
bakr
to
me
she
said
her
voice
growing
faint
she
stroked
the
girl
s
still
plump
cheeks
if
i
die
before
you
return
tell
him
my
last
request
was
that
the
prophet
pray
at
my
funeral
asma
shook
her
head
refusing
to
face
that
possibility
you
ca
nt
die
i
wo
nt
let
you
the
girl
was
not
them
was
as
strong
as
that
of
any
mother
and
daughter
perhaps
stronger
for
asma
had
chosen
her
over
her
actual
mother
qutaila
who
had
refused
to
accept
the
new
faith
abu
bakr
had
divorced
his
first
wife
for
it
was
forbidden
for
a
believer
to
share
a
bed
with
an
idol
worshiper
the
proud
qutaila
had
left
their
home
in
a
furious
rage
vowing
to
return
to
her
tribe
but
asma
had
refused
to
go
with
her
the
girl
had
chosen
the
straight
path
the
way
of
the
messenger
and
her
father
abu
bakr
that
had
been
three
years
ago
and
asma
had
not
seen
her
mother
since
umm
ruman
had
felt
sorry
for
the
abandoned
child
still
too
young
to
understand
the
enormity
of
her
choice
and
had
raised
the
girl
as
her
own
she
wondered
what
would
happen
to
asma
once
she
was
gone
abu
bakr
would
likely
look
for
a
new
wife
but
there
were
only
a
handful
of
believers
and
the
message
was
spreading
pagan
leaders
of
mecca
learned
the
truth
of
what
the
prophet
was
teaching
their
wrath
would
be
kindled
and
the
tiny
community
the
believers
had
founded
in
the
shadows
would
be
exposed
and
destroyed
in
all
likelihood
asma
would
be
alone
without
any
foster
mother
to
guide
her
through
the
journey
of
womanhood
the
girl
was
past
due
for
her
cycles
which
usually
began
at
the
age
of
ten
or
eleven
for
those
born
under
the
harsh
arabian
sun
the
menstrual
flow
would
erupt
any
day
now
but
umm
ruman
would
not
be
there
to
comfort
her
through
the
shock
of
first
blood
she
ran
her
hand
through
asma
s
brown
curls
hoping
to
bequeath
a
soft
memory
with
her
touch
that
would
comfort
the
child
in
the
days
to
come
and
then
a
shock
of
pain
tore
through
umm
ruman
s
womb
and
she
screamed
asma
broke
free
of
her
stepmother
s
grasp
she
fell
back
stumbling
over
one
of
the
bricks
that
the
midwife
had
placed
at
umm
ruman
s
swollen
feet
for
a
salve
to
ease
her
patient
s
agony
the
girl
turned
and
ran
in
search
of
her
father
umm
ruman
closed
her
eyes
and
said
silent
prayer
even
as
her
body
burned
from
within
as
her
uterus
contracted
with
increasing
urgency
she
could
feel
the
baby
shifting
preparing
to
emerge
into
the
world
a
process
that
in
all
likelihood
would
lead
to
her
death
and
possibly
the
baby
s
as
well
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
she
thought
sadly
umm
ruman
was
right
but
in
ways
she
could
not
have
expected
my
father
abu
bakr
walked
through
the
quiet
streets
of
mecca
his
head
bowed
low
his
back
hunched
slightly
as
if
the
weight
of
the
world
was
on
his
shoulders
which
of
course
it
was
tonight
everything
had
changed
and
he
needed
to
tell
someone
normally
he
would
have
gone
straight
home
after
emerging
from
the
prophet
s
house
as
their
dwellings
were
next
door
to
each
tonight
he
needed
to
take
a
walk
and
besides
his
wife
had
entered
labor
earlier
that
he
just
cuts
up
sometime
when
it
s
payday
you
know
that
huh
i
hated
his
sarcasm
and
righteousness
and
wondered
how
anyone
could
be
fool
enough
to
sit
in
a
church
and
listen
to
this
man
talk
about
the
gospel
he
walked
away
from
us
stepping
carefully
over
each
row
his
starched
overalls
creasing
neatly
behind
the
knees
billy
was
at
the
water
can
in
the
shade
of
the
oaks
with
his
back
to
mr
willis
and
was
just
buttoning
his
shirt
over
his
stomach
when
he
heard
or
felt
mr
willis
behind
him
lord
god
almighty
you
give
me
a
start
there
preacher
he
said
you
know
my
rule
billy
if
you
mean
chunking
the
mater
i
guess
you
got
me
mr
willis
reached
out
and
took
the
bottle
from
under
the
flap
of
billy
s
shirt
he
unscrewed
the
cap
and
poured
the
wine
opened
and
closed
his
hands
in
desperation
oh
sweet
lord
you
do
punish
a
man
he
said
mr
willis
started
walking
toward
his
house
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
holding
the
bottle
lightly
with
two
fingers
and
swinging
the
last
drops
onto
the
ground
then
he
stopped
his
back
still
turned
toward
us
as
though
a
thought
were
working
itself
toward
completion
in
his
head
and
came
back
to
the
water
can
with
his
gray
eyes
fixed
benignly
on
billy
haskel
s
face
i
ca
nt
pay
a
man
for
drinking
in
the
field
he
said
you
had
better
go
on
home
today
i
picked
for
you
many
a
season
preacher
that
s
right
and
so
you
knew
my
rule
this
stuff
s
going
to
kill
you
one
day
and
that
s
why
i
ca
nt
pay
you
while
you
do
it
billy
swallowed
and
shook
his
head
he
needed
the
work
in
front
of
the
rest
of
us
then
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
blew
his
breath
up
into
his
face
well
like
they
say
i
was
looking
for
a
job
when
i
found
this
one
he
said
i
ll
get
my
brother
to
drive
me
out
this
afternoon
for
my
check
he
walked
to
the
blacktop
and
i
watched
him
grow
smaller
in
the
distant
pools
of
heat
that
shimmered
on
the
tar
surfacing
then
he
walked
over
a
rise
between
two
cornfields
and
was
gone
that
s
my
fault
juanita
said
he
would
have
fired
him
anyway
i
ve
seen
him
do
it
to
people
before
no
he
stopped
and
came
back
because
he
was
thinking
of
what
i
said
he
could
nt
have
gone
to
his
house
without
showing
us
something
you
do
nt
know
mr
willis
he
wo
nt
pay
billy
for
today
and
that
s
one
day
s
wage
he
s
answer
and
i
knew
that
she
was
nt
going
to
talk
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
i
wanted
to
do
something
awful
to
mr
willis
at
five
o
clock
we
lined
up
by
the
bus
to
be
paid
clouds
had
moved
across
the
sun
and
the
breeze
was
cool
off
the
river
in
the
shadow
of
the
bus
the
sweat
dried
on
our
faces
and
left
lines
in
the
dust
film
like
brown
worms
billy
s
brother
came
out
in
a
pickup
truck
to
get
billy
s
check
i
was
right
about
mr
willis
he
did
nt
pay
billy
for
that
day
the
brother
started
to
argue
then
gave
it
up
and
said
i
reckon
the
sun
would
come
up
green
if
you
did
nt
try
to
sharp
him
preacher
juanita
was
standing
in
front
of
me
she
had
taken
her
bandanna
down
and
her
indian
hair
fell
on
her
shoulders
like
flat
star
points
she
began
pushing
it
away
from
the
nape
of
her
neck
until
it
lay
evenly
across
brush
right
into
her
rump
i
had
to
bite
my
teeth
at
the
quiver
that
went
through
my
loins
do
you
want
to
go
to
the
root
beer
place
on
the
highway
i
said
i
never
go
there
so
tonight
s
a
good
time
to
start
all
right
that
easy
i
thought
why
did
nt
i
do
it
before
but
maybe
i
knew
and
if
i
did
nt
mr
willis
was
just
about
to
tell
me
after
he
gave
me
my
check
he
asked
me
to
walk
to
his
car
with
him
before
i
got
on
the
bus
during
the
summer
a
boy
can
get
away
from
his
regular
friends
and
make
other
friends
that
do
nt
have
anything
to
do
with
his
life
do
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
maybe
i
do
nt
want
to
know
what
you
mean
mr
willis
your
father
is
a
university
teacher
doing
my
face
felt
dead
and
flat
as
though
it
had
been
stung
with
his
open
hand
i
m
not
going
to
talk
with
you
anymore
i
m
going
to
get
on
the
bus
now
i
said
all
right
but
you
remember
this
hack
a
redbird
does
nt
sit
on
a
blackbird
s
nest
i
stepped
onto
the
bus
and
pulled
the
folding
doors
closed
behind
me
mr
willis
s
face
slipped
by
the
windows
as
we
headed
down
the
dusty
lane
somebody
was
already
sitting
next
to
juanita
and
i
was
glad
because
i
was
so
angry
i
could
nt
have
talked
to
anyone
we
got
to
the
produce
market
in
yoakum
juanita
gave
me
her
address
a
street
name
belonging
to
a
vague
part
of
town
with
clapboard
houses
and
dirt
yards
and
i
drove
uncle
sidney
s
pickup
out
to
his
house
in
the
country
my
mother
was
dead
and
my
father
was
teaching
southern
history
for
the
lived
with
my
uncle
sidney
he
raised
tomatoes
melons
beans
corn
and
squash
and
anything
he
planted
grew
better
and
bigger
than
any
other
crop
in
the
county
he
always
had
the
fattest
turkeys
and
best
fed
angus
and
brahmas
and
each
year
his
preserves
won
a
couple
of
prizes
at
the
county
fair
but
he
was
also
the
most
profane
man
catches
himself
sorry
congressman
grayson
is
such
a
close
friend
of
mine
i
m
so
happy
that
it
all
worked
out
he
grins
and
allows
me
to
recognize
that
i
m
indebted
to
him
for
my
current
state
of
employment
which
indeed
i
am
three
months
ago
between
driving
my
mother
to
therapist
appointments
to
the
pharmacy
and
to
neiman
marcus
i
slowly
and
then
instantly
lost
grip
on
my
own
sanity
and
then
finally
after
ten
months
there
was
that
night
with
the
pot
and
the
broken
wrist
and
jack
white
and
i
finally
broke
down
and
explained
to
my
mother
that
i
d
be
leaving
california
that
i
was
too
young
that
it
was
too
early
for
me
to
be
playing
nurse
in
a
convalescent
home
for
one
against
her
best
wishes
she
understood
she
had
to
so
we
made
an
arrangement
with
my
aunt
and
i
began
for
penn
i
had
majored
in
political
science
and
french
literature
and
while
the
latter
captured
a
greater
portion
of
my
interests
in
depth
knowledge
of
camus
while
impressive
at
ivy
league
reunions
and
un
receptions
neither
of
which
i
ve
attended
is
not
exactly
a
marketable
trait
on
the
job
market
so
i
brushed
off
this
unopened
copy
of
the
federalist
papers
that
had
been
assigned
reading
in
at
least
six
classes
and
set
my
sights
on
washington
it
d
be
good
i
thought
rewarding
an
exercise
in
service
and
duty
i
called
chase
the
next
day
asked
if
his
father
had
any
connections
a
pointless
query
but
a
formality
nonetheless
and
precisely
thirty
minutes
later
i
had
a
job
with
congressman
john
grayson
of
california
s
forty
first
congressional
district
they
say
that
good
timing
is
everything
and
indeed
it
is
because
an
assistant
legislative
aide
was
going
to
be
attending
law
school
in
the
fall
and
had
decided
to
spend
the
remainder
of
her
free
life
teaching
art
did
nt
care
about
the
details
as
he
excitedly
relayed
the
news
to
me
over
the
phone
on
a
warm
february
morning
i
would
no
longer
be
driving
ms
mark
and
what
a
coincidence
that
congressman
grayson
represents
your
district
back
in
california
eh
i
nod
and
say
yes
yes
it
s
wonderful
really
wonderful
but
silently
i
m
thinking
how
truthfully
it
s
not
such
a
mind
blowing
convergence
of
events
that
really
kip
is
close
friends
with
the
entire
republican
caucus
yes
sir
i
say
and
take
a
sip
of
the
champagne
i
m
very
excited
for
the
opportunity
enough
with
the
sir
nonsense
the
king
pats
me
on
the
back
again
you
re
like
a
second
son
to
me
like
a
second
son
two
hours
later
and
my
blood
alcohol
content
levels
have
elevated
from
officially
wasted
to
lethally
toxic
and
i
m
sitting
indian
style
sun
s
beating
down
relentlessly
on
the
back
of
my
neck
causing
the
alcohol
to
boil
and
simmer
and
thin
in
my
veins
i
pick
methodically
at
the
green
blades
which
is
truly
the
only
action
that
seems
to
suppress
the
mixture
of
champagne
and
gin
and
bile
that
s
mixing
in
the
back
of
my
throat
and
moscow
was
absolutely
gorgeous
which
i
did
nt
really
expect
from
a
country
that
used
to
be
communist
i
have
no
idea
where
this
girl
has
come
from
nor
an
inclination
why
she
thinks
i
m
in
any
mental
state
to
hear
about
whatever
time
she
s
spent
in
the
former
soviet
union
it
s
just
a
fantastic
opportunity
doing
advance
for
the
vice
president
if
i
could
just
get
my
hands
on
some
water
i
think
that
d
help
and
where
has
chase
gone
what
people
do
nt
realize
about
cheney
is
that
he
s
really
like
a
big
teddy
bear
a
great
big
teddy
bear
he
loves
to
give
paternal
is
the
word
she
keeps
using
yeah
i
really
get
that
vibe
and
annalee
where
s
annalee
he
did
nt
mean
to
shoot
that
friend
of
his
mr
whittington
just
got
in
the
way
of
dick
s
gun
i
mean
christ
she
lights
a
cigarette
it
was
an
honest
mistake
really
so
i
say
tired
of
hearing
about
the
vice
president
s
honest
mistakes
with
guns
and
lawyers
how
do
you
know
chase
chazy
god
i
ve
known
him
forever
and
i
m
suddenly
sorry
i
ve
asked
kip
and
daddy
both
worked
for
exxonmobil
in
government
relations
at
the
same
time
then
kip
left
to
start
lsh
and
daddy
stayed
on
board
with
exxon
chase
went
to
st
alban
s
and
i
went
to
the
national
cathedral
school
you
ve
heard
of
ncs
right
i
was
two
years
above
him
he
dated
friends
when
we
were
in
high
school
and
then
of
course
he
went
to
penn
she
gives
me
a
nod
and
i
went
to
princeton
but
we
just
stayed
the
absolute
best
of
friends
she
stops
abruptly
i
m
surprised
he
never
mentioned
me
to
you
but
i
m
not
in
the
mood
to
hurt
any
feelings
so
i
assure
her
that
it
s
likely
he
did
and
that
i
d
just
forgotten
so
many
names
you
know
oh
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean
just
the
other
day
i
was
at
this
happy
hour
at
daily
grill
that
was
arranged
by
princeton
s
d
c
alumni
association
and
i
was
utterly
appalled
at
how
many
names
i
d
forgotten
in
a
span
of
three
years
i
mean
d
c
is
small
and
all
but
you
really
do
nt
run
into
as
many
people
as
you
think
you
would
i
suppose
it
s
a
matter
of
i
cut
her
off
and
ask
her
if
she
knew
my
the
year
before
her
nathaniel
what
s
your
last
name
mark
nathaniel
mark
hmm
was
he
in
an
eating
club
she
stops
and
feigns
embarrassment
ugh
i
absolutely
despise
asking
that
about
people
was
he
in
an
eating
club
it
s
just
so
juvenile
and
faux
pretentious
the
girl
s
