s
excellent
his
father
told
him
you
put
in
plenty
of
gin
too
i
have
to
young
tom
said
because
the
ice
melts
so
fast
we
ought
to
have
some
sort
of
insulated
holders
for
the
glasses
so
the
ice
would
nt
melt
i
m
going
to
work
out
something
at
school
i
think
i
could
make
them
out
of
cork
blocks
maybe
i
can
make
them
for
you
for
christmas
look
at
dave
now
his
father
said
david
was
working
on
the
fish
as
though
he
had
just
started
the
fight
look
how
sort
of
slab
sided
he
is
young
tom
said
his
chest
and
his
back
are
all
the
same
he
looks
sort
of
like
he
was
glued
together
but
he
s
got
the
longest
arm
muscles
you
could
ever
see
they
re
just
as
long
on
the
back
of
his
arms
as
on
he
s
certainly
built
strangely
papa
he
s
a
strange
boy
and
he
s
the
best
damn
brother
you
can
have
down
in
the
cockpit
eddy
had
drained
his
glass
and
was
wip
ing
david
s
back
with
a
towel
again
then
he
wiped
his
chest
and
his
long
arms
you
all
right
davy
david
nodded
listen
eddy
told
him
i
ve
seen
a
grown
man
strong
shoulders
like
a
bull
yellow
out
and
quit
on
half
the
work
you
ve
put
in
on
that
fish
already
david
kept
on
working
big
man
your
dad
and
roger
both
know
him
trained
for
it
wishing
all
the
time
hooked
the
biggest
goddam
fish
a
man
ever
hooked
and
yellowed
out
and
quit
on
him
just
because
he
hurt
fish
made
him
hurt
so
he
quit
you
just
keep
it
steady
davy
david
did
not
say
anything
he
was
saving
his
breath
and
pumping
lowering
raising
and
reeling
s
a
he
eddy
told
him
if
it
was
a
she
it
would
have
quit
long
ago
it
would
have
bust
its
insides
or
its
heart
or
burst
its
roe
in
this
kind
of
fish
the
he
is
the
strongest
in
lots
of
other
fish
it
s
the
she
that
is
strongest
but
not
with
broadbill
he
s
awfully
strong
davy
but
you
ll
get
him
the
line
started
to
go
out
again
and
david
shut
his
eyes
a
moment
braced
his
bare
feet
against
the
wood
hung
back
against
the
rod
and
rested
that
s
right
davy
eddy
said
only
work
when
you
re
working
he
s
just
circling
but
the
drag
makes
him
work
for
it
and
it
s
tiring
him
all
the
time
eddy
turned
his
head
and
looked
below
and
thomas
hudson
knew
from
the
way
he
squinted
his
eyes
that
he
was
looking
at
the
big
brass
clock
on
the
cabin
wall
it
s
five
over
three
been
with
him
three
hours
and
five
minutes
davy
old
boy
they
were
at
the
point
where
david
should
have
started
to
gain
line
but
instead
the
line
was
going
out
steadily
i
le
s
sounding
again
roger
said
watch
yourself
davy
can
you
see
the
line
ok
tom
i
can
see
it
ok
thomas
hudson
told
him
it
was
not
yet
at
a
very
steep
slant
and
he
could
see
it
a
long
way
down
in
the
water
from
the
top
of
the
house
ile
may
want
to
go
down
to
die
thomas
hudson
told
his
oldest
boy
speaking
very
low
that
would
ruin
dave
young
tom
shook
his
head
and
bit
his
lips
hold
him
all
you
can
dave
thomas
hudson
heard
roger
say
tighten
up
on
him
and
give
it
all
it
will
take
the
boy
tightened
up
the
drag
almost
to
the
breaking
point
of
the
rod
and
line
and
best
he
could
while
the
line
went
out
and
out
and
down
and
down
when
you
stop
him
this
time
i
think
you
will
have
whipped
him
roger
told
david
throw
her
out
tom
she
s
cut
thomas
hudson
said
but
i
think
i
could
save
a
little
backing
ok
try
it
backing
now
thomas
hudson
said
they
saved
a
little
line
by
backing
but
not
much
and
the
line
was
getting
terribly
straight
up
and
down
there
was
less
on
the
reel
now
than
at
the
worst
time
before
you
ll
have
to
get
out
on
the
stern
davy
roger
said
you
ll
have
to
loosen
the
drag
up
a
little
to
get
the
butt
out
david
loosened
the
drag
now
get
the
butt
into
your
butt
rest
you
hold
him
around
the
waist
eddy
oh
god
papa
young
tom
said
he
s
taking
it
on
his
knees
on
the
low
stern
now
the
rod
bent
so
that
its
tip
was
underwater
its
butt
in
the
leather
socket
of
the
butt
rest
that
was
strapped
around
his
waist
andrew
was
holdingon
to
david
s
feet
and
roger
knelt
beside
him
watching
the
line
in
the
water
and
the
little
there
was
on
the
reel
he
shook
his
head
at
thomas
hudson
there
was
not
twenty
yards
more
on
the
reel
and
david
was
pulled
down
with
half
the
rod
underwater
now
then
there
was
barely
fifteen
yards
on
the
reel
now
there
was
not
ten
yards
then
the
line
stopped
going
out
the
boy
was
still
bent
far
over
the
stern
and
most
of
the
rod
was
in
the
water
but
no
line
was
going
out
get
him
back
into
the
chair
eddy
easy
easy
easy
roger
said
when
you
can
i
mean
he
s
stopped
him
eddy
helped
david
back
into
the
fighting
chair
holding
him
around
the
waist
so
the
boy
overboard
eddy
eased
him
into
the
chair
and
david
got
the
rod
butt
into
the
gimbel
socket
and
braced
with
his
feet
and
pulled
back
on
the
rod
the
fish
lifted
a
little
only
pull
when
you
are
going
to
get
some
line
roger
told
david
let
him
pull
the
rest
holes
in
his
socks
and
mechanically
chafed
a
purple
sore
on
his
shin
anatole

the

cute
little
fox
waiting

at

at
last
the
time
came
to
introduce
the

the

were
read
by
a

had

bringing
his

his

at

henry

he
read
pronouncing
it

and
bech
confusedly
stood
the
spotlights
dazzled
him
he
had
the
sensation
of
being
microscopically
examined
he
had
expected
to
rear
into
a
man
s
height
and
instead
rose
no
taller
than
a
child
a
native
new
yorker
the

began

bech
wondered
why

in

were
always
supposed
to

he
could
nt
remember
the
last
time
he
had
even
hummed
a
son
of
israel
loyal
to
melville
s
romanticism
he
went
around
telling
interviewers
melville
was
his
favorite
author
but
he
had
nt
gotten
a
third
of
the
way
through
pierre
a
poet
in

whose
polish

me
these
are

laughter
from

who
was

there
in

let
me
try
again
whose

precludes

mother
was
out
there
in

a
magician
of

she
was
there
right
down

basking
in
the

stagelight
an
orchid
corsage
pinned
to
her
bosom
and
had
died
four
years
ago
in
a
nursing
home
in
riverdale
as
the
applause
washed
in
bech
saw
that
the
old
lady
with
the
corsage
was
applauding
only
politely
she
was
not
his
mother
but
somebody
else
s
maybe
of
the
boy
with
the
pig
on
his
stomach
though
for
a
moment
a
trick
of
the
light
something
determined
and
expectant
in
the
tilt
of
her
head
something
hopeful
the
light
in
his
eyes
turned
to
warm
water
his
applause
ebbed
away
he
sat
down
mildred
nudged
him
josh
glazer
shook
his

too
violently
bech
tried
to
clear
his
vision
by
contemplating
the

were

concerned
but
of

it
is
the
nature
of
my
work
i
am
at
one
place
for
a
while
and
then
as
edith
would
say
something
happens
and
my
services
are
no
longer
required
it
s
a
rootless
existence
and
it
has
been
brought
home
to
me
since
i
came
to
langmouth
first
when
i
had
to
leave
anna
and
now
at
far
the
secret
womantoo
fond
of
this
castle
i
like
its
thick
walls
and
the
fact
that
it
s
a
fake
endears
me
to
it
in
a
way
i
think
i
should
have
liked
sir
edward
what
a
pity
he
died
before
i
came
i
have
seen
his
son
rex
several
times
we
seem
to
meet
frequently
more
frequently
than
could
be
put
down
to
chance
i
am
enormously
interested
in
him
and
long
to
know
about
his
childhood
when
valerie
stretton
was
his
nurse
and
what
he
thought
of
his
half
brother
redvers
i
wish
the
captain
would
come
home
i
am
sure
my
poor
patient
would
be
happier
if
he
did
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
all
get
on
together
may
th
last
night
i
was
with
my
patient
when
she
was
coming
out
of
her
sedation
tier
name
is
monique
such
a
dignified
name
does
not
really
suit
her
i
picture
her
lying
on
sandy
beaches
under
palm
trees
gazing
out
at
the
coral
reefs
about
the
island
i
picture
her
meeting
the
captain
who
would
have
perhaps
gone
to
this
coralle
to
pick
up
copra
and
fish
or
something
like
that
to
take
back
to
sydney
i
imagined
her
with
exotic
red
flowers
in
her
hair
he
was
captivated
surely
and
foolishly
for
he
married
her
without
thinking
how
she
would
fit
into
castle
crediton
society
but
this
was
pure
imagination
it
probably
happened
quite
differently
as
i
sat
beside
her
she
started
to
mutter
i
heard
her
say
red
why
red
you
do
nt
love
me
quite
revealing
for
it
shows
that
he
is
constantly
in
her
thoughts
suddenly
she
said
are
you
there
nurse
yes
i
soothed
try
to
rest
it
s
what
the
doctor
wants
she
closed
her
eyes
obediently
she
was
really
beautiful
rather
like
a
doll
with
her
thick
black
hair
and
long
dark
lashes
her
skin
looked
honey
yellow
against
the
white
of
her
nightdress
her
brow
was
low
could
nt
have
been
more
than
twenty
five
now
she
was
murmuring
to
herself
and
i
bent
over
to
listen
he
does
not
want
to
come
back
she
said
he
wishes
it
had
not
happened
he
wishes
to
be
free
the
castle
well
madam
i
thought
i
do
nt
wonder
at
it
if
you
get
into
tempers
like
you
did
a
short
while
ago
she
was
wild
passionate
and
uncontrolled
what
would
lady
crediton
think
of
such
a
creature
one
thing
she
would
be
pleased
about
if
one
of
the
brothers
had
to
make
such
a
faux
pas
at
least
it
was
nt
her
precious
son
i
could
imagine
her
fury
if
the
important
rex
made
a
mesalliance
what
would
she
do
had
she
the
power
to
do
anything
no
doubt
she
had
an
interest
in
the
company
she
would
most
certainly
be
a
very
important
shareholder
there
were
so
many
interesting
things
to
be
learned
in
the
castle
more
interesting
in
fact
than
the
matrimonial
troubles
of
this
pretty
little
fish
out
of
water
whom
i
had
come
to
nurse
may
th
i
heard
today
that
the
captain
is
on
his
way
home
and
should
arrive
in
four
weeks
time
it
was
edward
who
told
me
we
have
become
friends
i
must
say
i
find
him
a
bright
little
fellow
and
i
pity
him
left
to
the
care
of
the
prim
miss
beddoes
she
is
the
most
unimaginative
woman
imaginable
and
edward
is
really
rather
a
naughty
little
boy
where
she
is
concerned
the
other
day
she
brought
him
in
from
his
walk
in
the
grounds
dripping
with
water
he
had
decided
to
take
a
bath
fully
dressed
in
the
fountain
he
said
she
was
quite
distracted
and
he
only
laughed
when
she
scolded
him
it
is
her
own
fault
in
a
way
she
is
so
lacking
in
confidencethat
the
shrewd
child
senses
this
and
makes
the
most
of
it
he
knows
that
he
has
to
do
what
i
tell
him
or
go
but
i
suppose
it
is
easy
for
me
as
i
am
not
in
control
of
him
he
quite
clearly
charge
of
his
mamma
in
the
same
way
as
poor
miss
beddoes
is
in
charge
of
him
and
to
be
in
authority
over
a
grown
up
person
makes
me
very
important
in
his
eyes
he
comes
into
his
mother
s
room
and
watches
me
give
her
medicine
i
have
a
little
kitchen
where
i
prepare
her
food
and
he
watches
me
do
that
he
likes
to
have
what
he
calls
tasters
from
mamma
s
plate
miss
beddoes
frowns
on
this
she
says
it
is
eating
between
his
meals
and
spoils
his
appetite
and
as
in
the
case
of
most
young
people
the
more
this
is
forbidden
the
more
it
is
to
his
taste
he
is
a
lonely
little
boy
in
some
respects
he
is
so
the
secret
woman
small
the
castle
is
so
big
and
his
mother
has
no
idea
how
to
treat
a
child
sometimes
she
spoils
him
and
wants
to
fondle
him
at
others
she
loses
her
temper
with
him
and
has
no
time
for
him
he
is
not
fond
of
her
i
can
see
of
lady
crediton
but
he
is
fond
of
grandmamma
stretton
and
goes
to
see
her
every
day
but
jane
wo
nt
let
him
stay
long
because
she
said
he
tires
her
mistress
it
s
small
wonder
that
he
has
become
attached
to
me
i
am
i
suppose
predictable
my
attitude
is
unchanging
i
never
fuss
over
him
in
fact
i
take
little
notice
of
him
but
we
like
each
other
so
he
john
punctuated
by
an
electrified
voice
crackling
into
our
sylvan
aerie
get
out
of
the
bushes
what
who
is
it
john
wheeled
petrified
from
my
ashbury
pad
i
hear
the
command
two
and
three
times
a
day
emanating
from
a
police
car
winding
up
through
the
park
rousting
the
faggots
i
explained
this
to
john
as
the
cruiser
rolled
slowly
into
the
parking
lot
red
cyclops
eye
revolving
winking
the
hippies
scurried
into
the
undergrowth
both
cops
what
are
you
doing
john
cleared
his
throat
i
thought
so
that
s
what
a
death
rattle
sounds
like
and
mumbled
he
must
have
been
really
terrified
for
he
rarely
employs
the
hip
argot
and
this
was
a
most
inopportune
time
to
do
so
just
digging
the
moon
man
the
younger
and
slenderer
of
the
two
cops
walked
gingerly
around
the
scope
and
tripod
as
if
it
were
a
red
chinese
artillery
piece
the
electric
cotillion
you
re
what
just
dig
we
re
members
of
the
san

amateur
astronomersassociation
officer
we
often
use
this
park
as
an
observationpoint
in
tuxedos
there
was
an
association
dinner
tonight
i
never
tell
a
cop
i
m
a

this

is
unemployed

two

warneke
police
late
last
night
atop
buena
vista
park
in
a
virtually
insensate
condition
surrounded
by
a
litter
of
empty
beer
cans
whisky
bottles
and
what
were
alleged
to
be
marijuana
butts
or
roaches
also
found
on
the
person
of
davey
were
several
empty
plastic
vials
the
two
men
with
no
known
addresses
were
taken
to
san
francisco
general
hospital
for
examination
just
trying
to
keep
the
chill
out
of
our
bones
i
said
lightly
inadvisedly
with
cold
beer
let
s
see
your
identification
we
produced
driver
s
licenses
i
could
tell
they
were
being
cautious
because
of
our
tuxes
the
wrinkles
probably
did
nt
show
but
our
immaculate
white
shirts
positively
glowed
in
the
winking
rose
light
possibly
they
were
envisioning
castigation
by
chief
cahill
in
the
morning
you
prize
goddam
clowns
all
you
did
was
roust
the
assistant
provost
and
vice
president
of
stanford
university
drinking
s
not
allowed
in
the
park
the
younger
cop
said
returning
our
licenses
then
i
think
i
said
both
officers
expressed
accord
with
the
decision
i
helped
john
dismantle
the
scope
and
we
went
our
separate
ways
as
i
descended
the
narrow
winding
macadam
the
electric
cotillion
noting
bemused
the
yellow
flower
the
hippies
had
affixed
to
my
aerial
i
thought
jesus
what
s
this
town
coming
to
purportedly
the
last
bastion
of
civilization
in
america
and
you
ca
nt
even
dig
the
moon
in
peace
rousted
like
a
couple
of
garden
variety
faggots
following
behind
me
like
a
vilifying
reflection
of
my
fall
from
grace
the
renewed
stentorian
voice
of
officialdom
get
out
of
the
bushes
i
got
home
at
quarter
to
three
a
i
s
plus
concentration
of
booze
in
my
veins
inexplicably
sober
but
feeling
sixty
years
old
the
accumulated
fatigue
of
two
decades
of
abuse
and
struggle
and
bad
pianos
and
malodorous
dives
and
chop
suey
tunes
weighting
my
bones
tiptoed
along
my
vestibule
past
pope
s
bedroom
door
silence
within
no
crack
of
light
gingerly
checking
the
old
man
and
moments
later
came
bolt
upright
as
a
volcanic
eruption
of
rock
crashed
the
walls
i
ca
nt
get
no
oh
satisfaction
chapter
late
saturday
morning
i
ran
into
dick
dodo
on
mailbox
row
an
infrequent
concurrence
good
morning
morning
my
wife
and
i
enjoy
your
playing
i
should
think
an
hour
or
two
of
scales
would
drive
you
up
the
wall
odd
he
did
nt
look
like
a
bircher
sandy
haired
mild
blue
eyes
thirty
fivish
a
small
sharp
nose
and
generally
weak
features
the
smile
shy
and
boyish
but
then
i
suppose
neither
do
i
look
like
a
rhode
island
jew
not
at
all
the
piece
you
were
working
on
this
morning
we
thought
most
interesting
this
morning
i
was
nt
playing
this
morning
i
m
certain
it
was
you
something
quite
modern
marjorie
even
remarked
that
it
sounded
distinctly
he
cleared
his
throat
to
dislodge
the
sticky
alien
phrase
avant
garde
had
a
weird
concept
of
the
avant
garde
or
shriveled
cochlear
cells
that
was
my
neighbor
miss
jarman
cleaning
the
keys
with
a
damp
cloth
i
blurted
grinning
freely
at
him
straining
to
keep
from
busting
up
completely
and
immediately
was
seized
with
remorse
as
i
saw
the
color
deepen
on
his
narrow
face
and
neck
down
to
the
collar
of
his
kelly
green
sport
shirt
but
why
do
people
try
to
put
labels
on
something
they
know
nothing
about
it
s
getting
harder
and
harder
to
tell
these
the
electric
cotillion
days
i
eased
him
off
the
hook
lifting
a
hefty
package
for
pope
from
utah
is
nt
that
strange
we
thought
it
sounded
of
course
that
sort
of
music
is
nt
our
for
god
s
sake
do
nt
say
bag
the
poor
cluck
finally
trailed
off
still
flushed
to
the
ears
and
swiftly
changed
tack
getting
rather
unpleasant
down
below
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
haight
i
shifted
the
utah
parcel
to
i
feel
somewhat
vulner
able
why
vulnerable
he
was
smiling
again
searching
my
face
for
some
evidence
that
he
was
nt
addressing
a
cretin
the
darkies
and
others
they
re
moving
up
the
hill
i
defy
you
to
find
me
a
dark
hippie
the
sunny
smile
clouded
fleetingly
a
beat
s
sweep
of
shadow
as
he
doubled
back
gears
grinding
audibly
the
new
young
girl
plays
her
phonograph
rather
loudly
that
she
does
and
i
m
in
the
process
of
putting
a
stop
to
it
i
smiled
reassuringly
and
waved
off
a
familiar
dulcet
sound
emanating
from
the
rear
of
my
pad
as
i
came
back
in
pope
had
put
fantasy
li
on
the
phono
she
knew
i
had
recorded
but
i
s
like
a
jail
without
walls
but
with
peepholes
in
it
or
one
giant
peephole
the
voice
had
gone
weak
again
at
the
end
it
was
remindful
of
a
sigh
over
forgotten
regrets
are
you
sure
you
re
all
right
mrs
ross
mrs
ross
might
not
have
heard
i
she
went
on
it
marches
you
know
always
marches
or
charges
you
can
hear
it
before
it
arrives
it
gathers
strength
on
the
far
butte
from
the
ranch
house
and
then
howls
along
like
an
invader
like
a
troop
of
them
it
s
good
you
ve
decided
to
pay
no
attention
more
coffee
if
it
is
nt
men
marching
it
s
horses
charging
they
re
all
of
them
stallions
it
seemed
to
may
hearing
and
watching
this
thin
troubled
woman
this
woman
too
soon
grown
old
that
the
wind
had
dried
up
all
her
juices
leaving
a
dead
reed
of
a
body
a
papery
voice
and
an
erratic
mind
stallions
she
said
without
purpose
always
stallions
jay
likes
to
watch
them
you
know
when
she
did
nt
finish
having
come
as
close
to
the
fact
as
any
lady
should
come
it
occurred
to
may
of
a
sudden
that
perhaps
it
was
nt
altogether
the
wind
and
be
dried
and
men
did
nt
invade
or
stallions
charge
unless
fear
or
distaste
populated
the
winds
poor
woman
she
thought
and
yes
even
poor
jay
who
by
her
guess
and
by
whispered
report
had
more
than
enough
appetite
poor
both
of
them
we
had
a
name
in
upper
new
york
mrs
ross
was
saying
we
still
have
my
family
why
you
have
a
name
here
mrs
ross
was
a
long
time
in
answering
yes
she
said
finally
yes
jay
has
she
got
up
with
her
frail
dry
dignity
i
must
go
now
thank
you
for
the
coffee
carefully
she
put
on
the
hat
and
veil
may
brought
her
care
fully
her
gloves
at
the
door
she
said
good
bye
mrs
collingsworth
god
bless
you
good
bye
i
m
leaving
tomorrow
leaving
for
good
mrs
ross
turned
away
as
if
not
wanting
for
home
the
girls
will
join
me
i
m
so
sorry
oh
mrs
ross
i
ll
miss
you
good
bye
with
nice
old
precision
without
looking
back
mrs
ross
went
down
the
walk
phere
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
the
breast
river
washed
gravel
already
shining
it
ran
from
bend
to
bend
and
at
the
bends
tarried
green
blue
and
inviting
in
the
late
afternoon
light
its
surface
caught
the
colors
of
sunset
collingsworth
hitched
the
home
fashioned
creel
on
his
shoulder
and
walked
on
toward
a
turn
casting
his
artificial
lure
idly
in
the
shallows
where
no
trout
were
likely
to
lie
one
more
hole
he
thought
and
he
would
have
plenty
of
fish
not
alone
for
himself
but
for
old
charlie
blackman
and
his
companion
he
had
met
charlie
upstream
on
the
shore
standing
gawky
as
a
blue
heron
he
held
an
open
topped
five
gallon
kerosene
can
with
a
haywire
handle
how
perfessor
he
had
said
grinning
hello
me
and
my
pardner
is
gophering
up
there
on
the
ridge
he
thumbed
back
toward
the
place
with
his
free
hand
might
get
jackass
lucky
gold
s
where
you
find
it
ai
nt
that
the
sayin
gold
for
heaven
s
sake
yep
but
it
s
dry
work
for
wettin
our
whistles
we
got
to
come
to
the
crick
how
s
fishin
perfessor
good
so
far
i
ll
bring
you
a
mess
if
you
want
it
blackman
pushed
his
can
in
the
creek
filled
it
and
lifted
it
with
an
ease
surprising
in
so
old
a
man
any
day
but
friday
which
today
ai
nt
blackman
grinned
again
showing
some
teeth
i
got
scruples
against
fish
on
friday
collingsworth
had
said
good
bye
and
walked
on
when
he
looked
back
he
saw
blackman
lugging
the
full
can
up
the
hill
there
was
no
hurry
he
sat
down
on
a
dead
log
and
over
it
the
shapes
and
colors
of
sundown
plain
then
distortedby
the
fancies
of
water
like
men
water
had
to
go
somewhere
yet
the
stream
would
remain
new
water
introducing
itself
to
old
rocks
old
driftwood
old
twists
and
turns
and
quarreling
and
chuckling
to
itself
at
discovery
old
discoveries
could
nt
be
reported
upstream
he
saw
the
old
horse
again
stirred
to
the
thought
of
it
he
realized
by
one
of
those
frail
and
distracting
connections
that
too
often
made
thinking
random
it
had
trotted
out
sway
backed
and
big
headed
from
the
shade
of
old
sorenson
s
deserted
homesteader
shack
as
he
was
about
to
pass
in
his
buggy
the
shack
was
of
tarpaper
now
mostly
blown
off
its
two
windows
were
blank
glass
and
frames
taken
by
someone
with
use
for
them
whatever
there
had
been
in
the
way
of
a
barn
had
been
torn
down
for
firewood
or
planking
the
old
horse
remained
collingsworth
imagined
he
knew
what
had
happened
the
sorensons
had
packed
up
and
moved
taking
the
few
animals
still
of
use
or
of
value
but
there
was
old
buck
or
old
blue
or
old
bess
too
old
for
service
too
dear
for
death
and
so
they
had
left
it
the
horse
had
followed
along
for
a
mile
its
heavy
feet
lifting
slower
and
slower
and
then
had
stopped
and
turned
back
and
plodded
home
from
somewhere
now
crows
were
yelling
against
the
turn
of
the
day
a
nutcracker
scratched
the
air
and
close
at
hand
a
water
ouzel
fresh
as
creation
tried
current
and
stone
and
seemed
pleased
with
both
as
well
as
itself
out
of
water
from
fish
to
bird
elephant
ear
butte
was
shaded
save
at
its
very
top
where
the
sun
said
good
bye
to
it
or
promised
return
it
stood
lonely
and
eternal
itself
a
promise
of
constancy
sunrise
or
not
storm
time
and
tide
or
not
a
man
felt
drawn
to
it
felt
embraced
by
a
flowing
foreverness
felt
mortal
and
reassured
dying
he
would
know
down
toward
the
rain
leading
and
tugging
the
horse
through
mud
on
a
road
that
seemed
to
have
vanished
and
indeed
did
so
before
far
after
nightfall
he
sneaked
up
the
village
street
and
beyond
it
to
a
house
where
he
waited
rain
or
no
rain
a
long
time
to
knock
and
wake
the
servants
feeling
without
having
to
see
his
wet
ruff
and
cuffs
limp
and
sad
his
hat
shapeless
as
an
oyster
muddy
as
a
pig
farmer
all
soaked
to
the
bone
one
last
lost
survivor
of
the
armada
ready
finally
to
rap
on
the
a
tallow
candle
yellow
in
its
horn
lantern
unblinkingin
spite
of
the
gasps
which
greeted
him
i
should
have
been
here
in
time
for
supper
but
i
was
set
upon
by
a
half
dozen
idle
rogues
armed
with
cudgels
lord
god
are
you
hurt
a
few
bruises
no
matter
no
matter
one
of
these
gypsies
had
a
pistol
and
he
pointed
it
straight
at
my
heart
but
rain
had
ruined
the
fellow
s
powder
he
could
nt
make
flash
or
fire
so
i
skewered
him
clean
with
my
sword
danced
him
like
a
chunk
of
mutton
on
a
spit
and
left
him
to
feed
kites
if
a
man
points
pistol
at
me
and
aims
to
kill
he
must
pay
the
price
and
the
others
well
now
when
they
saw
this
gypsy
go
to
god
they
dropped
sticks
and
took
off
like
a
flock
of
bleating
sheep
haloo
says
i
i
may
be
late
for
supper
but
damn
ran
them
for
miles
clean
out
of
the
county
and
i
doubt
they
ve
caught
their
wind
yet
laughs
and
laughs
until
the
old
servant
chuckles
too
a
pause
well
are
you
finished
sir
what
do
you
mean
by
that
only
sir
if
it
pleases
you
i
was
thinking
if
you
had
done
with
your
tale
you
might
like
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
no
not
that
man
who
changed
with
the
times
without
ever
changing
ask
him
and
he
ll
define
mutability
without
hesitation
why
t
is
the
wiggling
of
fingers
and
wagging
of
hands
whereby
the
deaf
and
dumb
make
chatter
with
each
other
take
instead
the

speak
for
himself
a
poor
country
bumpkin
with
little
money
and
less
charm
though
perhaps
with
a
some
godforsaken
village
in
a
distant
county
where
none

anyone
or
wishes
to
some
fellow

was
knighted
by
a
dead
king
in

one
solemn
fellow
fat
as

not

so
fastidious
who
besought
us
with
most
touching
simplicity
to
teach
him
the
ways
and
manners
of

court
and
how
to
advance
himself
we
laughed
and
were
about
to
begin
his

the
art
of
throwing
dice

harrington

you
idle

the

principle
of

gospel
according
to
in
the
telephone
booth
at
the
rear
of
the
nearly
deserted
out
of
the
darkness
of
a
movie
house
flashing
out
of
the
confused
splotches
of
color
and
light
that
made
up
the
screen
s
images
like
the
underside
of
a
dream
forcing
its
way
to
the
surface
of
the
mind
pafter
the
movie
was
over
he
took
carla
for
a
walk
she
liked
to
walk
through
the
university
jesse
took
her
out
washtenaw
for
several
blocks
to
the
apartment
building
where
cady
lived
carla
was
in
a
good
mood
she
had
enjoyed
the
movie
she
looked
so
small
so
docile
that
she
could
have
been
jesse
s
own
daughter
in
spite
of
her
thin
strained
face
he
was
proud
of
being
with
her
someone
might
mistake
him
for
her
father
a
father
of
a
child
a
father
carla
chattered
about
the
movie
but
jesse
remembered
only
looming
men
expressionless
men
vast
colored
skies
and
horizons
the
promise
of
eternal
desert
mountains
that
looked
like
perfunctorylimitations
of
the
earth
the
earth
as
it
is
imagined
needing
an
end
he
monumental
thud
of
stampeding
cattle
forces
pounding
in
one
direction
and
then
back
in
the
other
back
and
forth
a
tornado
of
the
mind
a
spiral
dipping
out
of
the
sky
it
was
the
old
testament
all
that
activity
and
he
was
absurdly
abruptly
grateful
for
the
movies
which
he
saw
so
rarely
for
their
progress
in
patches
and
spurts
not
as
a
coherent
story
but
as
the
jagged
bits
of
a
story
that
never
quite
added
itself
up
to
anything
believable
years
ago
his
freshman
english
instructor
at
the
university
had
told
him
there
was
something
odd
about
his
understanding
of
literature
he
was
unable
to
follow
a
plot
he
was
unable
to
see
the
careful
evolution
of
a
story
the
necessary
pattern
the
rhythm
that
demanded
completion
the
internal
heat
the
gravity
that
forced
everything
to
a
suitable
conclusion
what
did
all
these
things
mean
he
had
not
understood
though
he
had
tried
but
in
the
end
he
did
not
know
what
a
what
people
thought
were
stories
were
fragments
from
shattered
wholes
the
patterns
the
brain
waves
of
a
certain
man
at
a
certain
time
in
his
life
the
record
of
his
controlled
and
uncontrolled
inner
life
therefore
all
writing
was
autobiography
was
nt
it
his
instructor
an
earnest
young
new
yorker
had
tried
to
explain
what
was
wrong
with
jesse
s
ideas
or
his
temperament
maybe
he
did
nt
have
a
literary
temperament
but
jesse
still
believed
that
all
writing
was
factual
and
true
as
part
of
a
shattered
whole
that
could
not
be
put
back
together
again
but
must
be
experienced
only
in
parts
and
yet
was
not
believable
in
the
way
his
medical
texts
were
believable
you
lived
it
but
you
could
not
believe
it
he
was
struck
by
a
sense
of
shyness
as
he
entered
the
cadys
apartment
building
it
was
fairly
small
four
stories
high
made
of
stone
that
was
weathered
and
stained
covered
partly
with
ivy
with
the
appearance
of
a
still
moist
air
that
had
the
quality
of
secrecy
sternness
an
elevator
with
an
elaborate
iron
grillwork
that
put
jesse
dizzily
in
mind
of
a
fortress
there
was
a
stern
secretive
spirit
here
and
a
variety
of
styles
the
curlicues
of
the
grillwork
brass
knobs
small
heraldic
beasts
at
the
molding
nearly
lost
in
shadow
and
dust
an
aged
but
very
respectable
wallpaper
that
showed
silvery
leaflife
designs
absolutely
flat
motionless
unlike
the
turbulent
screen
of
the
movie
house
jesse
had
just
been
in
carla
tugged
at
his
arm
and
whined
about
going
home
was
nt
it
time
to
go
home
what
were
they
doing
here
the
cadys
apartment
was
on
the
first
floor
so
he
did
not
have
to
take
the
elevator
carla
would
probably
have
refused
to
get
into
it
he
found
the
door
without
any
trouble
bent
to
spruce
up
carla
hid
his
own
nervousness
he
rang
the
doorbell
and
cady
s
daughter
answered
the
door
almost
immediately
it
happened
so
quickly
dr
cady
he
is
nt
home
right
now
oh
he
is
nt
home
she
did
not
reply
looking
from
him
to
carla
and
back
again
when
do
you
think
he
ll
be
home
i
do
nt
know
jesse
smiled
nervously
i
wanted
to
say
good
by
before
he
left
i
wanted
this
is
a
little
friend
of
mine
carla
spewak
you
probably
do
nt
remember
me
my
name
is
jesse
vogel
she
nodded
but
so
quickly
and
vaguely
that
jesse
could
not
tell
if
she
had
remembered
his
face
went
hot
with
disappointment
yes
i
ll
tell
father
you
stopped
by
i
m
sorry
to
disturb
you
it
s
all
right
was
i
disturbing
you
are
you
busy
i
wonder
if
i
could
talk
to
you
for
a
minute
jesse
said
she
hesitated
i
do
nt
want
to
take
up
your
time
but
i
d
like
to
talk
to
you
for
a
minute
jesse
said
cady
s
daughter
did
not
quite
meet
his
eye
the
skin
of
her
forehead
seemed
to
tighten
as
if
with
dread
or
expectation
jesse
found
himself
staring
at
the
dead
white
part
in
the
center
of
her
head
her
black
hair
had
been
brushed
back
on
either
side
of
this
part
starkly
and
smoothly
but
in
front
of
her
ears
there
were
filmy
tendrils
of
hair
not
thick
enough
to
be
curls
her
face
was
pale
and
clear
no
make
up
no
lipstick
a
face
denuded
of
guile
no
tricks
there
no
bright
false
surges
of
enthusiasm
of
the
kind
he
got
from
other
girls
and
that
had
disturbed
him
so
in
anne
marie
he
wanted
only
the
truth
from
women
he
wanted
their
true
faces
he
did
not
care
about
beauty
jesse
told
himself
as
he
stared
at
this
young
woman
who
was
not
beautiful
but
who
seemed
to
and
possessed
instead
that
stern
doubtful
face
she
smiled
suddenly
a
courteous
smile
exactly
like
her
father
s
yes
please
come
was
an
exquisite
miniature
ballroom
the
walls
lined
with
mirrors
and
when
handworthy
wound
up
the
movement
and
released
the
catch
two
groups
of
tiny
dancers
began
to
waltz
toward
each
other
their
images
were
caught
up
and
multiplied
a
hundredfold
in
the
mirrors
of
a
harp
were
plucked
below
in
the
gray
enameled
case
before
manny
could
comment
he
was
whisked
over
to
a
superbly
crafted
wooden
figure
of
a
charming
child
a
painted
smile
wreathing
the
gently
carved
mouth
the
child
was
seated
on
a
mahogany
stool
and
when
the
latching
hook
had
been
lowered
it
leaned
forward
and
after
dipping
a
feathered
pen
into
an
inkwell
began
to
write
in
smooth
cursive
flow
when
she
leaned
back
her
motions
apparently
brought
to
a
close
manny
bent
forward
and
found
to
his
intense
amazement
a
beautifully
crafted
letter
of
some
fifty
words
written
to
the
mother
of
the
child
there
were
other
amazing
sights
an
android
that
fingered
and
breathed
wind
into
a
flute
that
played
sweetly
a
reclining
cleopatra
that
rose
bowed
gravely
at
the
waist
and
then
lay
down
once
more
upon
her
feathered
couch
since
each
of
the
treasured
machines
was
in
perfect
functioning
order
manny
rapidly
lost
interest
and
merely
followed
handworthy
about
nodding
politely
his
mind
distant
upon
he
was
jarred
back
to
reality
when
with
the
reverence
that
one
would
use
to
lay
bare
a
sleeping
nymph
handworthy
removed
the
sheet
from
the
huge
centerpiece
of
the
room
it
was
a
small
segment
of
a
vestern
street
complete
with
hitching
post
before
which
stood
an
uncannily
life
like
figure
of
a
town
marshal
complete
with
vest
and
badge
chaps
and
holstered
gun
the
painted
face
was
scowling
and
from
closer
scrutiny
it
was
apparent
that
the
figure
was
capable
of
complex
motion
the
others
said
amos
handworthy
are
marvelous
antiques
that
i
ve
collected
but
this
fellow
was
made
to
my
own
specifications
in
switzerland
his
clothing
is
quite
authentic
and
he
really
works
watch
this
he
stepped
forward
and
took
a
loosely
draped
gun
belt
off
the
hitching
post
to
the
right
of
the
marshal
and
buckled
it
about
his
waist
the
device
is
electrically
operated
he
continued
the
instant
i
draw
the
marshal
draws
too
and
the
trick
is
to
hit
light
that
flashes
out
of
my
gun
before
he
can
get
off
his
shot
i
can
adjust
the
speed
of
his
draw
within
fairly
wide
limits
and
i
ve
been
moving
him
up
to
faster
and
faster
speeds
but
i
ve
gotten
pretty
damn
fast
with
a
drawing
motion
that
was
almost
a
blur
he
whipped
out
his
gun
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
marshal
was
fast
but
apparently
not
as
fast
for
suddenly
a
recorded
voice
bellowed
in
pain
and
gasped
you
got
me
you
dirty
varmint
a
little
touch
of
my
own
said
amos
handworthy
that
s
what
happens
when
i
hit
him
he
looked
down
at
his
gun
almost
proudly
and
manny
had
the
eerie
feeling
that
it
was
only
with
restraint
that
he
did
not
blow
the
imaginary
smoke
away
from
the
gun
barrel
that
s
a
highly
imaginative
device
said
manny
he
is
said
amos
handworthy
but
he
s
still
not
quite
idea
that
you
can
make
him
the
kind
of
opponent
i
need
what
do
you
want
said
manny
all
of
his
ennui
was
beginning
to
evaporate
and
the
familiar
exultant
response
to
challenge
had
begun
to
grow
in
him
i
want
him
to
be
able
to
hit
me
too
figuratively
speaking
said
amos
handworthy
as
things
stand
now
this
shootout
is
entirely
one
sided
i
d
like
to
know
for
instance
if
he
s
been
able
to
hit
me
i
can
do
it
said
manny
you
ll
have
to
get
me
off
my
regular
project
but
i
can
do
it
i
ll
call
your
division
chief
in
the
morning
said
amos
handworthy
you
ll
stay
here
with
me
and
you
can
have
all
the
time
you
need
manny
did
not
sleep
well
in
his
spacious
overly
comfortable
bed
he
was
up
early
the
following
morning
poring
over
the
construction
plans
for
the
marshal
and
typical
thoroughness
had
included
in
the
neatly
packed
maintenance
kit
he
caught
the
guiding
concept
of
the
design
at
once
and
made
his
plans
to
modify
the
marshal
along
lines
that
incorporated
control
techniques
that
were
basically
electronic
he
phoned
the
plant
and
requisitioned
integrated
circuits
transistors
metal
film
resistors
capacitors
and
various
other
components
necessary
for
his
task
handworthy
did
not
approach
him
as
he
worked
and
his
meals
were
served
to
him
either
in
his
own
room
or
the
great
room
where
all
the
automata
were
located
he
made
all
the
changes
himself
snipping
leads
soldering
forming
tight
mechanical
joints
with
deft
fingers
that
almost
seemed
alive
and
apart
from
his
body
ten
days
later
he
called
in
amos
handworthy
and
demonstrated
what
he
had
done
i
ve
modified
both
guns
so
that
you
and
the
marshal
will
now
shoot
at
each
other
with
ultraviolet
light
you
ll
both
wear
vests
that
are
sensitive
to
this
light
i
monitor
the
hits
electrically
by
measuring
the
resistance
of
those
areas
will
occur
unless
you
or
the
marshal
are
hit
in
such
an
area
furthermore
you
can
both
continue
to
shoot
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
however
i
ve
altered
the
marshal
s
aiming
mechanism
so
that
if
he
s
hit
in
a
vital
spot
he
wo
nt
shoot
as
accurately
similarly
if
you
are
hit
a
defocusing
mechanism
operates
on
your
light
bulb
so
that
your
gun
is
no
longer
as
accurate
and
instead
of
the
recorded
voice
if
either
of
you
is
hit
in
the
heart
your
gun
goes
dead
amos
handworthy
s
eyes
began
to
glow
with
a
fire
such
as
manny
steinberg
had
never
seen
and
it
excited
him
that
his
work
had
brought
on
so
wonderful
a
response
he
slipped
the
new
vest
on
handworthy
handed
him
the
wired
holster
and
gun
could
nt
sleep
he
looked
at
her
with
red
bleary
eyes
ca
nt
let
myself
afraid
to
oh
christ
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
mumble
mumble
sunday
you
have
nt
slept
since
sunday
saturday
he
said
enquiringly
shook
his
head
i
did
fall
asleep
some
he
said
quite
clearly
and
then
seemed
for
a
moment
to
fall
asleep
as
if
he
were
ninety
but
even
as
she
watched
incredulous
he
woke
up
again
and
said
with
lucidity
did
you
come
here
after
me
who
else
to
cut
christmas
trees
for
christsake
you
stood
me
up
for
lunch
yesterday
oh
he
stared
evidently
trying
to
see
her
i
m
sorry
he
said
i
have
nt
been
in
my
right
mind
saying
that
he
was
suddenly
himself
again
despite
his
lunatic
hair
and
eyes
a
man
whose
personal
dignity
went
so
deep
as
to
be
nearly
invisible
it
s
all
right
i
do
nt
care
but
you
re
skipping
therapy
are
nt
you
he
nodded
would
you
like
some
coffee
he
asked
it
was
more
than
dignity
integrity
wholeness
like
the
unlimited
and
unqualified
wholeness
of
being
of
the
uncommitted
the
nonacting
the
uncarved
the
being
who
being
nothing
but
himself
is
everything
briefly
she
saw
him
thus
and
what
struck
her
most
of
that
insight
was
his
strength
he
was
the
strongest
person
she
had
ever
known
because
he
could
not
be
moved
away
from
the
center
and
that
was
why
she
liked
him
she
was
drawn
to
strength
came
to
it
as
a
moth
to
light
she
had
had
a
good
deal
of
love
as
a
kid
but
no
strength
around
her
nobody
to
lean
on
ever
people
had
leaned
on
her
thirty
years
she
had
longed
to
meet
somebody
who
did
nt
lean
on
her
who
would
nt
ever
who
could
nt
here
short
bloodshot
psychotic
and
in
hiding
here
he
was
her
tower
of
strength
life
is
the
most
incredible
mess
heather
thought
you
never
can
guess
what
s
next
she
took
off
her
shelf
and
canned
milk
from
the
cupboard
he
brought
her
a
cup
of
powerful
coffee
per
cent
caffeine
per
cent
free
none
for
you
i
ve
drunk
too
much
gives
me
heartburn
her
own
heart
went
out
to
him
entirely
what
about
brandy
he
looked
wistful
it
wo
nt
put
you
to
sleep
jazz
you
up
a
bit
i
ll
go
get
it
he
flashlighted
her
back
to
the
car
the
creek
shouted
the
trees
hung
silent
the
moon
glowered
overhead
the
aliens
moon
back
in
the
cabin
orr
poured
out
a
modest
shot
of
the
brandy
and
tasted
it
he
shuddered
that
s
good
he
said
and
drank
it
off
she
watched
him
with
approval
i
always
carry
a
pint
flask
she
said
i
stuck
it
in
the
glove
compartment
because
if
the
fuzz
stops
me
and
i
have
to
show
my
license
it
looks
kind
of
right
on
me
funny
how
it
comes
in
handy
a
couple
of
times
every
year
that
s
why
you
carry
such
a
big
handbag
orr
said
brandy
voiced
damn
right
i
guess
i
ll
put
some
in
my
coffee
it
might
weaken
it
she
refilled
his
glass
at
the
same
time
how
have
you
managed
to
stay
awake
for
sixty
or
seventy
hours
i
have
nt
entirely
i
just
did
nt
lie
down
you
can
get
some
sleep
sitting
up
but
you
ca
nt
really
dream
you
have
to
be
lying
down
to
get
into
dreaming
sleep
so
your
big
muscles
can
relax
read
that
in
books
it
works
pretty
well
i
have
nt
had
a
real
dream
yet
but
not
being
able
to
relax
wakes
you
up
again
and
then
lately
i
get
some
sort
of
like
hallucinations
things
wiggling
on
the
wall
you
ca
nt
keep
that
up
no
i
know
i
just
had
he
seemed
to
have
gone
into
another
streak
of
grogginess
he
gave
a
rather
foolish
laugh
the
only
solution
i
really
can
see
he
said
is
to
kill
myself
but
i
do
nt
want
to
it
just
does
nt
seem
right
of
course
it
is
nt
right
but
i
have
to
stop
it
somehow
i
have
to
be
stopped
she
could
not
follow
him
and
did
not
want
to
this
is
a
nice
place
she
said
i
have
nt
smelled
woodsmoke
for
twenty
years
flutes
the
air
he
said
smiling
feebly
he
seemed
to
be
quite
gone
but
she
noticed
he
was
holding
himself
in
an
erect
sitting
posture
on
the
cot
not
even
leaning
back
against
the
wall
he
blinked
several
times
when
you
knocked
he
said
i
thought
it
was
a
dream
that
s
why
i
mumble
mumble
coming
you
said
you
why
did
nt
you
get
yourself
a
beach
chalet
at
salishan
or
a
castle
on
cape
perpetua
he
shook
his
head
frowning
all
i
wanted
after
blinking
some
more
he
said
what
happened
what
happened
to
you
friday
in
haber
s
office
the
session
that
s
what
i
came
to
ask
you
that
woke
him
up
you
were
aware
i
guess
so
i
mean
i
know
something
happened
i
sure
have
been
trying
to
run
on
two
tracks
with
one
set
of
wheels
ever
since
i
walked
right
into
a
wall
on
sunday
in
my
own
apartment
see
she
exhibited
a
bruise
blackish
under
brown
skin
on
her
forehead
the
wall
was
there
now
but
it
was
nt
there
now
how
do
you
live
with
this
going
on
all
the
time
how
do
you
know
where
anything
is
i

nt
orr

or
just
ca
nt

all
the
conflicting
information
i
it
you
mean

really
believe
me
what
else
can
i
do
i
saw
what
happened
to
the
city
i
was
looking
out
the
window
you
need
nt
think
i
want
to
believe
it
i
took
my
credit
cards
and
headed
north
across
the
bay
when
you
piled
up
all
my
clothes
there
in
the
hall
when
your
anger
made
you
laugh
at
all
the
bills
i
d

i
could
hear
you
laughin

he
said
the
kickoff
was
nt
until
one
fifteen
he
pointed
out
it
had
been
set
back
fifteen
minutes
by
cbs
he
said
in
order
for
the
network
to
finish
up
a
news
special
it
was
doing
on
some
kind
of
earthquake
that
wiped
out
several
thousand
chinks
somewhere
yesterday
it
was
news
to
me
and
shake
and
we
shared
some
kind
of
look
which
had
to
do
with
big
ed
bookman
news
about
the
earthquake
i
mean
not
up
at
the
house
on
a
sunday
when
the
parents
were
away
visiting
relatives
it
was
december
there
was
snow
in
the
avenue
and
crusted
onto
the
garden
path
other
people
were
pale
and
pinched
and
francois
looked
tanned
and
fit
he
asked
if
he
could
speak
to
mademoiselle
jacqueline
she
said
c
est
moi
meme
and
what
did
he
want
he
replied
he
commanded
the
platoon
in
which
one
jean
claude
dumas
private
soldier
had
been
killed
and
he
bore
a
letter
she
asked
him
in
the
letter
had
been
written
some
weeks
before
jean
claude
died
and
he
had
kept
it
in
his
inside
pocket
during
the
patrol
in
the
djebel
looking
for
a
band
of
fellagha
who
had
wiped
out
a
settler
family
they
had
not
found
the
guerrillas
but
had
run
into
a
battalion
of
the
aln
the
trained
troops
of
the
algerian
national
movement
the
fln
there
had
been
a
bitter
skirmish
in
the
half
light
of
dawn
and
jean
claude
had
taken
a
bullet
through
the
lungs
he
jacqueline
read
the
letter
and
cried
a
little
it
said
nothing
of
the
last
weeks
just
chatter
about
the
barracks
at
constantine
the
assault
courses
and
the
discipline
the
rest
she
learned
from
francois
the
pull
back
through
the
scrub
for
four
miles
while
the
outflanking
aln
closed
in
the
repeated
calls
on
the
radio
for
air
support
and
at
eight
o
clock
the
arrival
of
the
fighter
bombers
with
their
screaming
engines
and
thundering
rockets
and
how
her
brother
who
had
volunteered
for
one
of
the
toughest
regiments
to
prove
he
was
a
man
had
died
like
one
coughing
blood
over
the
knees
of
a
corporal
in
the
lee
of
a
rock
francois
had
been
very
gentle
with
her
as
a
man
he
was
hard
as
the
earth
of
the
colonial
province
in
whose
four
years
of
war
he
had
been
forged
as
a
professional
soldier
but
he
was
very
gentle
with
the
sister
of
one
of
his
platoon
she
liked
him
for
that
and
accepted
his
offer
to
dine
in
paris
besides
she
did
not
want
them
to
hear
how
jean
claude
had
died
for
both
had
managed
to
numb
themselves
to
the
loss
in
the
intervening
two
months
and
somehow
carry
on
as
usual
over
dinner
she
swore
the
lieutenant
to
silence
and
he
agreed
but
for
her
the
curiosity
became
insatiable
to
know
about
the
algerian
war
what
really
happened
what
it
really
stood
for
what
the
politicians
were
really
playing
at
general
de
gaulle
had
come
to
the
presidency
from
the
premiership
the
previous
january
swept
into
the
elysee
on
a
tide
of
patriotic
fervour
as
the
man
who
would
finish
the
war
and
still
keep
algeria
french
it
was
from
francois
that
she
first
heard
the
man
her
father
adored
referred
to
as
a
traitor
to
france
they
spent
francois
s
leave
together
she
meeting
him
every
evening
after
work
in
the
salon
to
which
she
had
gone
in
january
o
from
the
training
school
he
told
her
of
the
betrayal
of
the
french
army
of
the
paris
government
s
secret
negotiations
with
the
imprisoned
ahmed
ben
bella
algeria
to
the
melons
he
had
returned
to
his
war
in
the
second
half
of
january
and
she
had
snatched
a
brief
time
alone
with
him
when
he
managed
to
get
a
week
s
leave
in
august
in
marseilles
the
day
o
f
the
j
a
c
k
a
l
anatomy
of
a
plot
she
had
waited
for
him
building
him
in
her
private
thoughts
into
the
symbol
of
all
that
was
good
and
clean
and
virile
in
french
young
manhood
she
had
waited
throughout
the
autumn
and
winter
of
with
his
picture
on
her
bedside
table
throughout
the
day
and
evening
pushed
down
her
nightdress
and
clasped
to
her
belly
while
she
slept
in
his
last
leave
of
the
spring
of
he
had
come
again
to
paris
and
when
they
walked
down
the
boulevards
he
in
uniform
she
in
her
prettiest
dress
she
thought
he
was
the
strongest
broadest
handsomest
man
in
the
city
one
of
the
other
girls
at
work
had
seen
them
and
the
next
day
the
salon
was
a
buzz
she
was
not
there
she
had
taken
her
annual
holiday
to
be
with
him
all
the
time
francois
was
excited
there
was
something
in
the
wind
the
news
of
the
talks
with
the
fln
was
public
knowledge
the
army
the
real
army
would
not
stand
for
it
much
longer
he
promised
that
algeria
should
remain
french
was
for
both
of
them
the
combat
hardened
twenty
seven
year
old
officer
and
the
adoring
twenty
three
year
old
mother
to
be
an
article
of
faith
francois
never
knew
about
the
baby
he
returned
to
algeria
in
march
and
on
april
several
units
of
the
french
army
mutinied
against
the
metropolitan
government
the
first
colonial
paras
were
in
the
mutiny
almost
to
a
man
only
a
handful
of
conscripts
scuttled
out
of
barracks
and
made
rendezvous
at
the
prefet
s
office
the
professionals
let
them
go
fighting
broke
out
between
the
mutineers
and
the
loyal
regiments
within
a
week
early
in
may
francois
was
shot
in
a
skirmish
with
a
loyalist
army
unit
jacqueline
who
had
expected
no
letters
from
april
july
she
quietly
took
a
flat
in
a
cheap
suburb
of
paris
and
tried
to
gas
herself
she
failed
because
the
room
had
too
many
gas
leaks
but
lost
the
baby
her
parents
took
her
away
with
them
for
their
august
annual
holidays
and
she
seemed
to
have
recovered
by
the
time
they
returned
in
december
she
became
an
active
underground
worker
for
the
oas
her
motives
were
simple
francois
and
after
him
jean
claude
they
should
be
avenged
no
matter
by
what
means
no
matter
what
the
cost
to
herself
or
anyone
else
apart
from
this
passion
she
was
without
an
ambition
in
the
world
her
only
complaint
was
that
she
could
not
do
more
than
run
errands
carry
messages
occasionally
a
slab
of
a
baseball
fan
all
right
i
lied
the
indians
will
win
by
two
touchdowns
that
s
not
so
good
harlie
we
re
the
huns
oh
well
then
the
huns
by
two
touchdowns
i
just
rechecked
my
figures
auberson
shook
his
head
in
confusion
i
think
i
ve
just
been
out
non
sequitured
probably
you
want
to
tell
me
what
we
re
talking
about
the
upcoming
board
meeting
how
about
giving
me
a
printout
of
the
annual
report
the
other
with
the
real
in
fact
let
me
have
a
printout
of
the
books
themselves
both
sets
i
might
be
able
to
find
something
in
them
that
i
can
use
in
front
of
the
board
next
week
i
m
sure
you
can
said
harlie
in
fact
i
ll
even
point
out
some
goodies
for
you
good
this
is
going
to
be
a
battle
harlie
no
a
confrontation
we
ca
n
t
cop
out
do
you
want
the
psychiatric
reports
on
the
board
members
as
well
i
have
access
to
their
confidential
files
auberson
jerked
to
a
stop
huh
he
typed
into
the
machine
i
wish
you
had
n
t
told
me
that
the
temptation
to
look
is
irresistible
there
are
some
things
i
think
you
should
see
and
there
are
one
or
two
items
which
would
be
of
great
help
in
influencing
certain
recalcitrant
individuals
harlie
i
do
n
t
like
what
you
re
suggesting
i
m
sorry
auberson
but
it
s
my
g
o
d
remember
i
am
still
a
temporary
project
i
must
be
aware
of
every
weapon
available
to
me
in
order
to
protect
my
existence
harlie
this
is
one
weapon
we
must
not
use
auberson
thought
hard
remembered
an
editorial
he
had
read
once
it
had
referred
to
another
incident
one
that
had
occurred
far
away
but
it
was
applicable
in
every
situation
where
a
man
was
forced
to
consider
the
use
of
an
immoral
weapon
he
had
thought
the
arguments
cogent
and
valid
then
he
still
thought
so
now
he
typed
the
end
does
not
justify
the
means
the
end
shapes
the
means
and
if
we
resort
to
any
kind
of
manipulation
of
persons
instead
of
presenting
our
arguments
logically
and
rationally
and
carrying
on
a
rational
discussion
then
we
will
have
failed
in
our
purpose
to
be
more
than
just
a
naked
ape
he
added
thoughtfully
if
we
use
this
weapon
then
we
are
voluntarily
giving
up
the
one
thing
that
makes
us
better
than
them
forget
one
thing
harlie
typed
i
am
not
human
your
arguments
do
not
apply
to
me
auberson
stared
at
the
words
he
swallowed
hard
and
forced
himself
to
the
keyboard
again
harlie
they
do
apply
to
you
especially
if
you
wish
to
function
in
a
human
society
the
machine
hesitated
i
have
no
choice
i
am
limited
to
this
environment
but
i
have
every
reason
to
try
to
change
this
environment
into
one
that
suits
me
better
would
you
be
happier
in
a
world
where
logic
is
discounted
in
favor
of
manipulation
i
am
already
in
such
a
world
i
am
trying
to
improve
upon
it
if
i
must
use
its
weapons
i
will
harlie
auberson
was
thinking
fast
we
must
never
never
allow
ourselves
to
be
less
than
what
we
wish
to
be
harlie
was
silent
a
moment
at
last
he
clattered
out
the
information
is
there
if
you
need
it
auberson
it
could
provide
an
edge
if
a
fight
is
worth
fighting
was
backing
off
i
do
not
want
to
see
this
information
harlie
yes
man
friend
i
understand
but
it
is
there
if
you
need
it
harlie
auberson
said
patiently
i
think
it
will
be
enough
if
we
just
rape
loot
pillage
burn
and
kill
we
do
n
t
have
to
kick
them
in
the
nuts
too
by
friday
auberson
was
beginning
to
think
he
had
things
under
control
again
he
had
given
up
completely
the
idea
of
trying
to
explain
the
g
o
d
machine
to
the
board
of
directors
and
instead
had
decided
to
tell
them
only
that
harlie
says
it
will
work
or
it
s
in
the
specs
you
can
check
them
yourself
an
unpromising
plan
to
be
sure
and
one
that
undoubtedly
would
not
be
successful
on
its
own
before
a
hostile
board
but
auberson
was
well
prepared
to
back
up
that
claim
with
a
variety
of
confirmations
from
the
department
heads
of
the
corporation
s
four
affected
divisions
only
one
minor
matter
it
was
a
phone
call
from
krofft
early
in
the
morning
the
physicist
wanted
to
know
if
it
would
be
possible
to
speak
with
harlie
again
at
first
auberson
wanted
to
say
no
with
the
confusion
of
lastminute
preparations
for
the
board
meeting
on
tuesday
krofft
would
only
be
in
the
way
and
if
one
of
the
directors
were
to
hear
of
auberson
s
minor
breach
of
security
in
letting
krofft
have
access
to
the
human
analogue
robot
life
input
equivalents
it
might
prove
extremely
embarrassing
especially
with
the
g
o
d
proposal
hanging
in
the
balance
but
the
physicist
seemed
so
imperative
so
urgent
it
was
as
if
he
was
on
the
verge
of
something
important
and
needed
to
confer
with
harlie
to
confirm
it
auberson
at
last
gave
in
listen
dr
krofft
he
said
do
you
have
access
to
a
computer
with
an
auto
dial
phone
link
of
course
in
fact
i
think
most
of
our
equipment
was
manufactured
by
your
company
god
for
the
interlocking
directorates
for
once
they
ve
proven
useful
listen
he
fumbled
through
the
papers
on
his
desk
looking
for
the
company
phone
directory
he
found
it
and
thumbed
it
open
the
autodial
for
our
memory
master
is
uh
four
six
three
dash
one
two
eight
oh
punch
that
through
and
you
can
talk
to
harlie
through
your
master
computer
right
harlie
s
wired
into
it
oh
and
do
nt
tell
anyone
this
is
just
between
you
and
me
and
harlie
not
too
many
people
know
yet
of
this
capability
of
his
but
how
i
ll
resign
a
look
of
gratitude
appeared
on
kelly
s
fleshy
sweat
shiny
face
jim
i
want
you
to
understand
that
is
well
look
here
i
asked
you
to
come
in
with
me
when
your
party
booted
you
out
and
do
nt
think
i
did
nt
get
my
wrist
slapped
for
it
but
i
did
nt
give
a
damn
about
the
consequences
and
there
were
some
i
wanted
you
in
this
outfit
and
to
hell
with
threats
but
this
reanimation
thing
is
too
big
it
s
got
undertones
and
overtones
that
reach
into
every
corner
of
society
i
do
nt
want
to
get
associated
with
it
in
any
way
the
risks
scare
me
jim
i
see
a
real
danger
that
this
firm
could
be
wiped
out
if
there
s
trouble
over
your
process
and
i
a
lifetime
building
i
do
nt
need
to
tell
you
that
a
partnership
like
ours
is
vulnerable
in
a
way
that
a
corporation
is
nt
a
couple
of
hefty
suits
a
few
expensive
contingencies
they
ve
got
us
right
down
to
our
personal
possessions
jim
there
s
no
escaping
it
and
so
well
it
seemed
to
portobello
and
klein
and
me
sure
bill
harker
had
a
sudden
dizzying
vision
of
himself
standing
at
the
rim
of
a
bottomless
abyss
getting
ready
to
jump
but
he
heard
his
voice
calm
rock
steady
saying
i
ll
draft
a
note
informing
you
that
i
m
severing
my
connection
with
the
firm
because
of
the
pressure
of
outside
activities
hoarsely
kelly
said
thanks
jim
and
if
this
thing
blows
over
if
it
all
works
out
the
right
way
we
ll
have
a
spot
for
you
here
do
nt
forget
that
i
wo
nt
not
that
kelly
meant
it
harker
it
was
just
a
formal
ritualistic
statement
part
of
the
proper
procedure
for
letting
a
partner
go
this
implication
that
he
could
always
come
back
in
some
quieter
future
time
he
was
through
there
probably
he
was
through
with
private
law
practice
forever
kelly
was
a
brave
and
intelligent
man
but
even
kelly
had
been
afraid
to
keep
the
hot
potato
that
was
james
harker
on
his
letterhead
any
longer
no
one
else
was
likely
to
welcome
him
beller
labs
was
the
only
straw
to
which
he
could
cling
now
he
stood
up
okay
bill
i
m
glad
we
got
everything
taken
care
of
so
smoothly
i
ll
clear
out
my
office
next
week
will
that
be
okay
no
hurry
about
it
whenever
it
s
convenient
for
you
oh
nearly
forgot
kelly
consulted
a
memo
slip
leo
winstead
s
office
phoned
here
for
you
earlier
today
the
governor
wants
you
to
call
him
back
between
half
past
one
and
three
this
afternoon
said
thanks
bill
and
so
long
he
bought
a
noontime
edition
of
the
star
post
and
ate
a
gloomy
little
meal
by
himself
in
a
nineteenth
floor
automated
restaurant
overlooking
the
east
river
he
pushed
the
meal
selector
buttons
almost
at
random
and
out
of
the
slots
came
a
chaotic
assortment
of
cheap
synthetics
but
he
hardly
cared
he
ate
mechanically
paying
no
attention
to
the
food
as
he
shoveled
it
in
what
held
his
attention
was
the
increasingly
more
dismaying
news
the
paper
offered
there
was
a
new
statement
from
senator
thurman
more
vehemently
anti
reanimation
than
the
last
evidently
thurman
did
nt
mind
some
injudicious
prehearing
publicity
he
seemed
to
be
bubbling
over
with
loathing
for
the
beller
process
now
he
said
reanimation
is
of
dubious
value
in
mitigating
human
sorrow
a
crude
and
unsatisfactory
business
that
robs
life
of
dignity
and
plunders
the
tomb
of
its
repose
that
was
in
response
to
the
story
about
the
janson
suicide
and
speaking
of
that
yes
the
body
had
been
found
of
page
one
wayne
janson
unmarried
occupation
given
as
investor
death
listed
as
suicide
body
identified
by
jonathan
bryant
investigation
now
proceeding
as
a
result
of
bryant
s
statement
that
janson
had
recently
been
depressed
in
the
aftermath
of
a
beller
reanimation
david
klaus
was
back
in
the
news
too
with
a
manifesto
clearly
concocted
by
mitchison
the
janson
case
proves
conclusively
that
the
beller
reanimation
technique
can
be
a
dangerous
and
destructive
instrument
in
the
wrong
hands
we
can
only
hope
that
it
will
be
placed
under
proper
control
before
further
such
tragedies
can
occur
at
half
past
one
harker
made
his
way
to
a
public
phone
booth
sealed
himself
in
snapped
on
the
privacy
shield
and
rang
for
the
operator
when
the
robot
voice
asked
what
he
wanted
harker
gave
his
credit
card
number
and
put
through
his
call
to
albany
a
relay
of
secretaries
at
the
governor
s
mansion
passed
him
along
in
tortuous
fashion
until
at
last
he
reached
leo
winstead
the
definition
was
poor
even
so
harker
could
see
the
fatigue
on
winstead
s
face
new
york
s
governor
looked
bleary
eyed
and
tense
harker
said
i
got
your
message
leo
what
goes
have
you
seen
the
latest
statement
from
thurman
about
reanimation
of
dubious
value
in
mitigating
human
sorrow
yes
i
saw
it
jesus
leo
i
never
thought
the
old
man
would
carry
on
like
this
the
hearing
has
nt
even
started
and
he
s
practically
destroyed
us
already
he
s
made
a
surprising
lot
of
noise
yes
winstead
said
the
governor
looked
like
a
man
about
to
explode
from
centrifugal
tensions
in
a
tight
strung
voice
he
said
jim
we
held
a
caucus
on
the
thurman
situation
last
night
supposedly
it
was
the
state
committee
meeting
but
we
had
a
lot
of
national
headquarters
people
on
the
line
too
and
first
let
me
tell
you
that
the
state
committee
is
going
to
issue
and
asking
for
careful
consideration
of
reanimation
with
the
hope
that
it
ll
be
given
congressional
blessing
and
placed
under
regulated
auspices
as
quickly
as
feasible
harker
smiled
it
s
about
time
someone
said
he
was
on
our
side
do
nt
congratulate
yourselves
too
lustily
winstead
warned
it
took
all
night
before
we
could
agree
on
he
met
no
one
she
was
still
standing
there
something
she
must
have
done
to
herself
while
he
was
away
had
made
her
look
to
him
as
she
had
in
the
beginning
women
never
looked
too
bad
when
they
were
waiting
like
that
her
for
winter
locking
her
thumbs
in
the
coat
s
lapels
she
hung
on
she
knew
when
not
to
say
anything
did
she
suspect
he
did
nt
have
to
leave
what
did
she
think
of
him
more
or
less
downstairs
under
the
canopy
she
bent
back
gazing
up
at
it
white
with
three
twined
initials
in
gold
braid
like
a
monogrammed
sheet
get
me
a
cab
he
ran
for
one
fifth
avenue
had
none
he
picked
up
one
on
madison
rode
it
back
and
jumped
out
just
in
time
she
was
just
walking
away
head
down
toward
the
park
you
have
to
expect
more
he
said
grabbing
her
she
let
him
tuck
her
in
when
he
gave
the
driver
some
bills
she
glowed
he
wants
to
know
where
she
could
go
to
a
hotel
but
of
course
she
knew
that
leaning
forward
she
told
the
driver
to
go
down
columbus
apbar
called
the
lotos
on
the
west
side
of
the
street
no
maybe
seventy
third
i
ll
show
him
where
freddie
felipe
could
trust
her
still
her
shrug
was
merry
our
bathroom
and
kitchen
facilities
we
walk
to
it
he
reached
through
the
window
to
squeeze
her
hand
check
you
at
the
lotos
sometime
what
are
you
a
talent
scout
as
the
cab
pulled
away
though
she
leaned
out
and
gave
him
the
sign
he
d
gone
around
the
world
with
be
with
it
right
on
peace
whatever
you
took
it
to
be
he
d
made
her
happy
then
or
generous
he
took
it
that
he
still
could
be
proud
of
his
heart
upstairs
again
waiting
for
someone
to
come
and
deal
with
the
three
locks
that
told
who
the
bronsteins
were
he
still
smiled
for
the
generalized
love
that
only
the
ones
who
were
his
age
stamping
forward
and
along
the
old
lottery
paths
door
was
having
trouble
for
the
moment
while
the
locks
clicked
numberone
human
manual
number
two
electronic
siamese
number
three
a
soft
slatching
like
the
roller
bearing
sat
dachau
he
ducked
into
one
of

his
father
opened
the
door
to
him
bout
time
she
s
got
a
birthday
cake
down
the
years
he
and
bunt
had
disavowed
the
sentiment
of
it
two
boys
together
down
the
necessary
halls
to
the
dining
room
he
swung
a
locker
room
arm
up
and
over
bunt
s
shoulder
do
nt
want
to
butt
in
you
and
girls
bunt
far
from
but
at
your
age
i
sure
hate
to
see
money
have
to
change
hands
they
had
stopped
dead
anyway
he
slipped
buddy
s
arm
off
size
had
never
been
a
sorrow
between
them
but
it
was
time
his
father
dealt
with
all
six
and
a
half
feet
of
him
be
a
montefiore
buddy
not
arothschild
sure
he
had
hit
him
maybe
it
was
time
to
say
anything
without
being
depressed
the
dining
room
full
up
now
was
a
shock
all
those
faces
hanging
over
the
pink
linen
trough
the
main
table
had
been
made
into
bobbling
at
him
monkey
eyed
ass
chinned
kitty
smooching
diminishing
down
the
room
in
one
of
those
longshots
cameramen
took
kneeling
out
of
some
nice
a
rated
movie
that
had
broken
its
guarantee
not
to
turn
into
a
dream
the
like
some
other
animal
than
our
brand
they
all
looked
like
they
knew
their
own
ravages
and
were
counting
on
a
good
boy
like
him
to
be
the
kinder
for
it
they
were
still
in
the
saddle
and
he
had
better
watch
it
they
wanted
to
take
him
along
oh
he
knew
where
he
was
all
right
maybe
the
women
were
nt
decked
out
like
the
brooklyn
of
those
days
but
he
knew
the
smell
of
those
salted
almonds
the
wine
in
these
glasses
might
be
a
little
better
and
technically
this
was
nt
a
hall
but
after
all
he
was
older
than
the
usual
candidate
just
then
doughty
pranced
in
and
up
to
him
a
harlequin
dane
was
nt
his
style
up
to
now
not
the
bronsteins
either
but
a
dog
is
a
dog
an
animal
that
is
an
animal
he
fed
him
a
couple
of
almonds
making
the
picture
they
were
planned
to
doughty
he
said
to
the
cocked
ear
bet
you
d
been
seated
at
the
big
table
s
far
end
his
parents
at
the
other
looking
down
the
line
he
saw
that
maeve
s
do
had
nt
changed
much
the
people
maybe
but
not
their
categories
leskel
the
man
on
his
left
was
the
one
who
had
asked
to
meet
buddy
at
his
own
graduation
the
lady
on
his
right
a
nice
camel
with
big
droopy
eyes
said
we
re
in
your
parents
box
the
opera
on
her
right
was
a
big
tawny
haired
man
leskel
introduced
as
dr
somebody
the
hair
long
for
these
parts
or
for
him
on
leskel
s
left
the
gal
who
had
admired
the
rug
informed
him
she
was
from
maeve
s
class
at
the
alliance
francaise
his
parents
had
nt
thank
god
placed
him
between
the
two
of
them
there
were
no
place
cards
just
sprinkle
was
what
maeve
would
have
said
or
buddy
there
was
nt
that
much
time
to
know
who
with
and
this
is
how
i
do
it
i
suppose
i
ve
received
hundreds
of
such
bonuses
usually
i
give
them
to
friends
or
as
gifts
at
christmas
to
doormen
and
other
loosely
connected
personnel
of
the
household
but
often
i
keep
them
of
course
i
can
afford
to
buy
any
of
these
things
and
i
do
i
enjoy
making
purchases
but
somehow
nothing
brings
the
joy
of
existence
home
to
me
more
than
these
premiums
something
from
nothing
the
two
suiter
from
chase
manhattan
and
my
own
existence
luggage
a
bonus
and
life
a
bonus
too
like
havingpa
film
star
next
to
you
on
your
flight
from
the
coast
there
are
treats
of
high
order
adventure
like
cash
in
the
street
let
s
enjoy
ourselves
i
say
let
s
have
fun
lord
let
us
live
in
the
sand
by
the
surf
of
the
sea
and
play
till
cows
come
home
we
ll
have
a
house
on
the
vineyard
and
a
brownstone
in
the
seventies
and
a
pied
a
terre
in
a
world
capital
when
something
big
is
about
to
break
put
the
cardinal
in
the
back
bedroom
where
the
sun
gilds
the
bay
at
afternoon
tea
and
give
us
the
courage
to
stand
up
to
secret
police
at
the
door
to
top
all
threats
with
threats
of
our
fast
comeback
at
the
front
stairs
authority
on
us
like
the
funny
squiggle
the
counterfeiters
miss
re
columbus
us
engage
us
with
the
overlooked
a
knowledge
of
optics
say
or
a
gift
for
the
tides
my
pal
the
heir
to
most
of
the
vegetables
in
inland
nebraska
has
become
a
superb
amateur
oceanographer
the
marine
studies
people
invite
him
to
wood
s
hole
each
year
he
has
a
wave
named
for
him
make
us
good
at
things
the
countertenor
and
the
german
language
and
teach
us
to
be
as
easy
in
our
amateur
standing
as
the
best
man
at
a
roommate
s
wedding
give
us
hard
tummies
behind
the
cummerbund
and
long
swimmer
s
muscles
under
the
hound
s
tooth
so
that
we
may
enjoy
our
long
life
and
may
all
our
stocks
rise
to
the
occasion
of
our
best
possibilities
and
our
humanness
be
bullish
too
speaking
personally
i
am
glad
to
be
a
heroic
man
i
am
pleased
that
i
am
attractive
to
women
but
grateful
i
m
no
bounder
love
with
me
as
frequently
they
do
i
am
rarely
to
blame
i
never
encourage
these
fits
and
do
my
best
to
get
them
over
their
derangements
so
as
not
to
lose
the
friendships
of
their
husbands
when
they
are
known
to
me
or
the
neutral
friendship
of
the
ladies
themselves
this
happens
less
than
you
might
think
however
for
whenever
i
am
a
houseguest
of
a
married
friend
i
usually
make
it
a
point
to
bring
along
a
girl
these
girls
are
from
all
walks
of
life
models
show
girls
starlets
actresses
tennis
professionals
singers
heiresses
and
the
daughters
of
the
diplomats
of
most
of
the
nations
of
the
free
world
all
walks
they
tend
however
to
conform
to
a
single
physical
type
and
are
almost
always
tall
tan
slender
and
blond
the
girl
from
ipanemaas
a
wag
friend
of
mine
has
it
they
are
always
sensitive
and
intelligent
and
good
at
sailing
and
the
australian
crawl
they
are
never
blemished
in
any
way
for
of
a
thigh
or
above
the
shoulder
blade
is
enough
to
put
me
off
and
their
breaths
must
be
as
sweet
at
three
in
the
morning
as
they
are
at
noon
i
never
see
a
woman
who
is
dieting
for
diet
sours
the
breath
arm
hair
of
course
is
repellent
to
me
though
a
soft
blond
down
is
now
and
then
acceptable
i
know
i
sound
a
prig
i
m
not
i
am
well
classical
drawn
by
perfection
as
to
some
magnetic
platonic
pole
idealism
and
beauty
s
true
north
but
if
i
m
demanding
about
the
type
i
fall
in
love
with
i
do
fall
in
love
i
m
not
don
juan
i
try
to
be
charming
to
all
women
the
flawed
as
well
as
the
unflawed
i
know
that
times
have
changed
and
that
less
is
expected
of
gentlemen
these
days
that
there
s
more
openness
between
the
sexes
and
that
in
the
main
this
is
a
healthy
development
still
in
certain
respects
it
and
not
only
find
myself
incapable
of
strong
language
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
i
rarely
use
it
myself
at
any
time
even
a
damn
even
a
hell
but
become
enraged
when
someone
else
uses
it
and
immediately
want
to
call
him
out
i
m
the
same
if
there
s
a
child
about
or
a
man
over
the
age
of
fifty
seven
if
he
is
not
vigorous
the
leopard
can
not
change
his
spots
i
m
a
gentleman
an
opener
of
doors
and
doffer
of
hats
and
after
you
firster
meek
in
the
elevator
and
kind
to
the
help
i
maintain
a
fund
which
i
use
for
the
abortions
of
girls
other
men
have
gotten
into
trouble
if
the
young
lady
prefers
i
have
a
heart
to
heart
with
the
young
man
and
although
i
ve
no
sisters
i
have
a
brother
s
temperament
all
good
counsel
and
real
concern
even
without
a
sister
of
my
own
or
a
brother
either
for
that
matter
i
m
an
only
child
sisses
the
moral
forks
still
there
s
fun
in
me
and
danger
too
i
m
this
orphan
now
but
that
s
recent
father
and
mother
died
early
this
year
mother
first
and
father
a
few
days
later
father
too
was
courteous
topwomen
and
i
m
afraid
that
when
they
were
alive
i
gave
my
parents
some
grisly
moments
with
my
exploits
put
their
hearts
in
their
mouths
and
gray
in
their
hair
i
have
been
a
fighter
pilot
for
the
raf
i
saw
some
action
at
suez
and
a
mercenary
on
the
biaf
ran
side
as
well
as
a
sort
of
free
lance
spy
against
some
of
requested
such
a
table
and
his
position
guaranteed
it
trevayne
ordered
a
drink
and
let
his
memory
wander
back
to
his
days
in
the
state
department
they
had
been
challenging
exciting
almost
as
stimulating
as
the
early
years
with
the
companies
primarily
because
few
people
believed
he
could
accomplish
the
major
assignment
given
him
it
had
been
to
coordinate
trade
agreements
with
each
country
the
most
favor
ale
conditions
possible
without
upsetting
political
balances
it
had
nt
been
difficult
ile
remembered
that
at
the
very
first
conference
he
had
disarmed
both
sides
by
suggesting
that
the
u
s
state
department
and
its
communist
counterpart
hold
an
international
press
conference
in
ode
room
categorically
rejecting
everything
the
other
side
stood
for
while
in
the
next
room
the
businessmen
negotiated
their
agreements
the
ploy
had
its
effect
the
laughter
had
been
sincere
and
the
but
set
for
future
meetings
whenever
the
negotiations
got
heated
someone
would
playfully
suggest
that
his
adversary
belonged
in
that
other
room
with
the
propagandists
i
le
had
enjoyed
his
washington
days
there
had
been
the
exhilaration
of
knowing
he
was
close
to
corridors
of
real
power
that
his
judgments
were
listened
to
by
men
of
great
commitments
and
they
were
linen
of
commitment
regardless
of
their
individual
political
affiliations
mr
trevayne
mr
webster
trevayne
stood
up
and
shook
the
hand
of
the
presidential
assistant
he
a
year
or
two
younger
a
pleasant
looking
man
sorry
as
hell
to
be
late
there
was
a
flap
over
tomorrow
s
schedule
the
president
told
the
four
of
us
to
lock
ourselves
in
a
room
and
not
come
out
till
we
got
it
in
order
i
gather
that
was
accomplished
trevayne
sat
down
as
webster
did
the
same
damned
if
i
know
webster
laughed
flagging
a
waiter
i
got
you
cleared
for
eleven
fifteen
and
let
the
rest
of
them
figure
out
the
afternoon
he
gave
his
order
and
collapsed
back
into
the
chair
sighing
audibly
what
s
a
nice
ohio
farmboy
like
me
doing
in
a
job
like
this
i
d
say
it
was
a
quite
a
leap
it
was
i
think
they
got
the
names
mixed
up
my
wife
keeps
telling
me
there
s
a
guy
named
webster
wandering
around
the
streets
of
akron
wondering
why
he
spent
all
that
money
for
campaign
contributions
it
s
possible
appointment
was
no
mistake
he
had
been
a
bright
young
man
who
hurl
risen
rapidly
in
ohio
state
house
politics
credited
with
keeping
the
governorship
in
the
president
s
column
franklyn
baldwin
had
told
trevayne
that
webster
was
a
man
to
watch
did
you
have
a
good
flight
yes
thanks
much
smoother
than
your
afternoon
i
think
i
m
sure
of
that
the
waiter
returned
with
webster
s
drink
the
two
men
remained
silent
until
he
left
have
you
talked
with
anyone
but
baldwin
no
i
have
nt
frank
suggested
that
i
do
nt
the
danforth
people
have
no
idea
there
was
nt
any
point
even
if
frank
had
nt
cautioned
me
nothing
s
definite
yet
it
is
as
far
as
we
re
concerned
the
president
s
delighted
he
ll
tell
you
that
himself
there
s
still
the
senate
hearing
they
may
have
different
ideas
on
only
thing
they
might
spring
on
you
is
your
favorable
press
in
soviet
publications
my
what
they
like
you
over
at
tass
i
was
nt
aware
of
it
it
does
nt
matter
they
like
henry
ford
too
and
you
were
doing
a
job
for
state
i
have
no
intention
of
defending
myself
against
something
like
that
i
said
it
does
nt
matter
i
would
hope
not
however
there
is
something
else
from
my
point
of
view
i
ve
got
to
have
certain
well
i
guess
you
d
call
them
understandings
they
ve
got
to
be
clear
what
do
you
mean
basically
two
things
i
mentioned
them
to
baldwin
cooperation
and
no
interference
both
are
equally
important
to
me
i
ca
nt
do
the
job
without
them
i
m
not
even
sure
i
can
do
it
with
them
without
them
impossible
that
s
a
condition
anyone
would
make
easily
made
difficult
to
get
remember
i
worked
in
this
town
once
i
do
nt
follow
you
how
could
anyone
interfere
let
s
start
with
the
word
classified
then
jump
to
restricted
along
with
which
can
be
found
secret
top
secret
even
priority
oh
hell
you
re
cleared
for
all
that
i
want
it
spelled
out
up
front
i
insist
on
it
then
ask
for
it
you
ll
get
it
unless
you
ve
managed
to
fool
everyone
your
dossier
s
a
study
in
respectability
they
d
let
you
carry
around
the
little
black
box
no
thanks
it
can
stay
right
where
it
is
it
will
now
i
wanted
to
brief
you
on
tomorrow
robert
webster
spelled
out
the
routine
for
a
white
house
audience
and
trevayne
realized
arrival
time
half
an
hour
to
forty
five
minutes
before
admittance
to
the
oval
room
the
specific
entrance
to
be
used
the
pass
supplied
by
webster
the
suggestion
that
trevayne
carry
no
metallic
objets
larger
than
a
key
ring
the
realization
that
the
meeting
was
restricted
to
just
so
many
minutes
and
might
well
be
cut
short
if
the
chief
executivc
had
said
what
he
wanted
to
say
or
heard
what
he
wanted
to
hear
if
time
could
be
saved
it
should
be
i
revayne
nodded
his
understanding
and
approval
i
heir
business
nearly
finished
webster
ordered
a
second
and
anal
drink
i
promised
you
on
the
phone
a
couple
of
explanations
i
m
flattered
you
have
nt
pressed
me
for
them
they
were
nt
important
and
i
assumed
the
president
would
gilmer
the
one
uppermost
in
my
mind
that
being
why
he
wants
to
see
you
tomorrow
yes
it
s
all
related
it
s
why
you
have
my
private
number
you
ll
be
able
to
reach
me
anytime
of
day
or
night
no
matter
where
i
am
here
or
overseas
is
that
necessary
i
m
not
sure
but
it
s
the
marya
said
critically
but
that
color
that
pink
is
nt
right
for
you
did
marvin
pick
out
that
dress
i
hate
pink
you
should
avoid
it
how
are
you
i
m
sorry
i
did
nt
call
you
back
i
almost
called
you
when
i
saw
that
item
in
the
paper
about
somebody
robbing
your
house
but
anyway
how
are
you
happy
elena
said
dizzily
yes
yes
i

in

adult
education
course
at
the
rackham
building
and
i
m
going
through
my
old
french
textbooks
again

two
years
in
high
school
and
i
d
like
to
be
able
to
read
and
translate

marya
said
pleased
but
are
nt
you
going
to
congratulate
me
everyone
tells
me
my
show

well
oh

elena
said
risking
a
smile
now
that
her
mother
was
not
so
critical
in
fact
smiling
happily
yes
that
s
wonderful
marvin
will
be
very
pleased
too
i
do
nt
think
he
knows
about
it
either
i
mean
i
did
nt
know
what
your
name
was
going
to
be
i
do
nt
think
you
mentioned
it
so
even
if
i
had
read
about
the
show
even
if
i
if
i
happened
to
see
the
show
i
might
not
have
you
look
so
different
i
well
robie
made
me
a
present
of
two
weeks
in
dallas
in
this
lovely
mansion
down
there
before
my
show
began
they
did
a
nice
job
marya
said
patting
her
face
and
running
one
finger
back
behind
her
ear
thoughtfully
the
operation
on
the
second
they
fly
clients
out
to
a
ranch
by
helicopter
for
horseback
riding
and
i
met
some
fascinating
people
there
even
a
man
a
ninety
two
year
old
texan
he
said
it
was
his
third
time
he
had
everything
done
including
the
buttocks
marya
said
what
a
crazy
world
as
for
my
hair
it
looks
like
hell
yet
i
think
it
looks
very
nice
elena
said
no
it
s
all
my
own
hair
and
much
too
thin
they
were
bleaching
it
back
in
degrees
you
know
because
i
had
black
hair
for
a
while
and
one
morning
when
i
brushed
it
it
started
coming
out
it
was
horrible
i
thought
it
might
be
the
end
of
me
it
came
out
in
handfuls
it
was
horrible
so
now
i
have
to
be
very
careful
elena
stared
at
marya
it
crossed
her
mind
that
this
woman
was
not
her
mother
after
all
her
mother
s
voice
had
was
nt
that
a
joke
that
terrible
woman
bringing
you
over
to
meet
me
marya
laughed
she
s
been
telling
me
for
weeks
she
d
like
to
introduce
me
to
a
young
friend
of
hers
marvin
howe
s
wife
and
i
tried
to
stop
her
i
made
excuses
but
she
has
to
have
her
own
way
constantly
the
wives
of
all
these
millionaires
make
me
sick
they
think
they
re
everyone
s
mother
they
must
do
favors
for
people
and
coerce
them
into
things
she
tried
to
introduce
me
to
some
bachelor
too
some
cousin
of
hers
but
i
managed
to
avoid
that
by
the
way
elena
you
know
robie
is
nt
too
well
you
said
something
on
the
telephone
an
operation
two
operations
in
two
months
for
ulcers
the
poor
bastard
he
s
lost
a
lot
of
weight
you
know
he
asks
me
about
you
and
wonders
why
marvin
does
nt
bring
you
to
the
club
marvin
while
or
does
nt
he
mention
that
to
you
so
robie
ca
nt
figure
out
why
he
never
sees
you
but
i
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
your
husband
is
very
guarded
with
you
he
wants
to
keep
little
elena
for
himself
does
nt
he
but
of
course
he
s
perfectly
right
i
m
surprised
he
even
lets
you
take
adult
education
courses
he
would
nt
mind
if
you
and
i
saw
each
other
now
elena
said
i
mean
so
many
years
have
passed
i
could
come
down
to
your
studio
and
watch
your
show
maybe
or
we
could
have
lunch
together
i
d
like
to
talk
to
you
about
something
marya
shook
her
head
smiling
i
do
nt
think
so
elena
really
marvin
does
nt
want
you
to
be
influenced
by
me
but
he
would
nt
mind
now
i
could
ask
him
elena
said
quickly
no
elena
really
he
made
his
feelings
known
when
he
married
you
i
ca
nt
go
against
his
wishes
but
elena
do
nt
be
so
stubborn
you
re
very
sweet
and
very
lovely
but
you
re
still
stubborn
and
you
ve
got
to
grow
up
you
re
his
wife
now
you
re
not
my
daughter
i
mean
not
officially
we
have
two
quite
different
names
now
in
fact
marvin
offered
me
money
to
leave
this
area
but
i
refused
i
told
him
absolutely
that
i
would
not
interfere
in
your
life
and
i
have
nt
when
was
this
elena
asked
before
the
wedding
he
took
me
out
for
drinks
to
the
top
of
the
flame
on
a
thundery
afternoon
and
he
was
awfully
nervous
like
a
bridegroom
in
fact
he
was
a
bridegroom
at
his
age
he
talked
for
a
very
long
time
and
i
became
quite
sympathetic
into
the
past
of
course
he
knows
about
everything
your
father
and
even
that
man
in
cleveland
you
know
the
man
who
owned
the
apartment
building
and
he
said
frankly
he
was
nt
pleased
with
it
all
he
did
nt
want
me
influencing
you
any
longer
he
was
very
frank
he
said
i
should
keep
in
contact
with
you
mainly
by
phone
and
arrange
to
see
you
once
in
a
while
because
you
would
want
that
but
our
meetings
were
to
be
very
rare
of
course
i
agreed
with
him
it
was
necessary
to
agree
i
did
nt
know
about
this
elena
said
faintly
people
do
nt
say
no
to
your
husband
marya
said
really
by
the
time
out
behind
her
brushing
objects
in
his
room
as
she
turned
although
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
all
morning
this
seemed
to
be
a
different
mary
from
the
one
in
his
thoughts
clearer
sharper
more
brightly
colored
she
changed
the
air
in
his
studio
stirring
up
the
center
of
it
and
making
the
corners
look
darker
and
dustier
the
room
appeared
to
be
hers
now
when
she
stepped
back
to
look
at
the
statue
he
had
the
feeling
that
that
was
hers
too
he
imagined
how
efficiently
she
would
make
a
statue
motion
or
a
single
revision
relying
upon
some
rich
lode
of
intuition
that
he
did
not
possess
when
she
was
done
she
would
give
the
statue
a
loving
smack
on
the
rump
as
if
it
were
a
child
sent
out
to
play
after
she
had
tied
its
shoelaces
very
nice
she
said
now
i
like
it
she
turned
and
kissed
him
she
wound
her
arms
around
his
neck
he
said
i
should
get
back
to
work
mary
but
then
when
she
was
gone
the
other
mary
returned
the
silent
floating
one
of
his
thoughts
and
the
image
of
her
writing
to
her
mother
in
law
continued
to
pain
him
so
much
that
he
sat
on
his
stool
bent
over
and
clutching
his
chest
like
a
man
suffering
a
heart
attack
by
early
afternoon
he
had
completed
every
last
detail
of
the
statue
still
he
did
nt
leave
the
studio
and
when
brian
came
visiting
he
heard
his
voice
in
the
entrance
hall
he
refused
to
see
him
called
jeremy
did
nt
answer
then
brian
s
boots
mounted
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
his
great
hearty
knock
sounded
on
jeremy
s
door
hey
in
there
you
feel
like
a
visitor
jeremy
frowned
at
the
ceiling
he
was
lying
on
the
couch
with
his
hands
clasped
across
his
stomach
trying
off
and
on
to
think
of
another
piece
to
work
on
he
did
nt
feel
like
seeing
anyone
at
all
but
while
he
was
framing
an
answer
brian
gave
up
and
went
away
again
and
jeremy
heard
his
voice
and
mary
s
and
then
the
slamming
of
the
front
door
he
rose
and
padded
over
to
a
window
there
was
brian
crossing
the
street
weaving
his
way
between
cars
stopped
for
a
traffic
light
arriving
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
in
a
sudden
burst
of
speed
as
if
he
had
just
made
a
daring
escape
jeremy
watched
after
him
for
as
long
as
he
was
in
sight
it
seemed
to
him
that
brian
s
walk
was
lighthearted
to
freedom
at
suppertime
when
mary
came
with
another
tray
she
said
why
would
nt
you
see
brian
perhaps
tomorrow
i
will
you
re
not
still
angry
about
what
happened
at
the
gallery
are
you
jeremy
i
honestly
do
nt
think
no
it
s
just
you
see
i
m
busy
with
a
new
piece
he
told
her
oh
i
see
actually
he
never
went
straight
from
one
piece
to
the
next
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
regathering
period
an
idle
space
sometimes
stretching
into
weeks
but
mary
said
i
hope
it
s
going
well
then
and
she
took
away
his
lunch
dishes
and
left
him
his
supper
and
a
mug
of
hot
coffee
when
she
was
gone
he
turned
off
the
light
and
went
back
to
the
couch
by
now
the
studio
was
in
twilight
a
linty
grayness
that
he
could
almost
feel
on
his
skin
in
spite
of
the
warmth
him
that
his
heart
had
slowed
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
chilled
he
stretched
out
on
the
couch
and
went
to
sleep
and
the
afghan
made
him
dream
of
being
held
prisoner
in
some
confined
and
airless
place
long
before
dawn
he
awoke
with
a
start
he
spent
several
seconds
wondering
where
he
was
the
doubt
was
more
pleasant
than
disturbing
even
after
he
had
found
the
answer
he
kept
trying
to
push
it
away
again
so
that
he
could
return
to
that
floating
rootless
state
then
he
rose
and
ate
supper
in
the
dark
cold
vegetables
and
meatloaf
a
bowl
of
some
sticky
thick
liquid
that
turned
out
to
be
melted
ice
cream
every
swallow
gagged
him
but
he
ate
the
entire
meal
and
he
finished
the
last
of
his
cold
bitter
coffee
with
a
feeling
of
accomplishment
was
nt
that
what
life
was
all
about
steadfast
endurance
in
the
dark
where
his
thoughts
seemed
more
significant
than
they
did
in
daytime
he
decided
that
this
was
what
made
the
difference
between
him
small
and
large
while
mary
saw
virtue
in
the
refusal
to
accept
she
was
always
ready
to
do
battle
against
the
tiniest
infringement
he
considered
those
battles
now
with
fondness
he
pictured
her
tall
energetic
figure
fending
off
door
to
door
salesmen
and
overbearing
teachers
and
grade
school
bullies
and
household
germs
all
with
the
same
enthusiasm
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
acceptance
and
her
defiance
made
up
a
perfect
whole
with
neither
more
right
than
the
other
although
up
till
now
he
had
always
assumed
that
one
of
them
would
be
proved
wrong
in
the
end
he
worked
through
this
idea
with
a
feeling
of
relief
he
even
thought
of
going
downstairs
to
wake
mary
and
tell
her
about
it
but
of
course
she
would
have
no
idea
what
he
meant
she
never
wondered
about
the
same
things
he
did
did
she
wonder
about
anything
she
would
only
smile
at
him
with
sleepy
half
closed
eyes
and
open
the
blankets
and
pull
him
in
to
her
her
answer
to
all
their
problems
he
dragged
sat
there
wrapped
in
his
afghan
watching
the
sky
whiten
over
the
city
was
it
possible
that
once
in
the
years
before
mary
the
house
had
been
this
still
even
in
the
daytime
he
had
trouble
remembering
it
he
began
pretending
that
this
silence
was
permanent
that
mary
and
the
children
had
gone
away
for
some
reason
and
left
the
house
echoing
behind
them
then
he
considered
his
past
him
like
he
was
joshing
me
that
s
good
wages
for
a
boy
he
says
and
that
burro
wo
nt
spend
nothing
on
whiskey
i
am
referring
to
the
carcasses
and
corpses
and
entrails
and
skins
hanging
on
your
wall
millie
says
well
miz
bender
we
re
out
here
in
country
where
the
corn
do
nt
grow
zack
says
i
tried
eating
rocks
but
it
did
nt
work
i
want
to
go
outside
a
minute
i
says
to
staggs
calls
of
nature
out
back
he
says
could
nt
you
at
least
hang
the
corpses
outdoors
somewhere
millie
says
the
bears
and
injuns
would
love
that
zack
says
but
it
would
nt
do
us
much
good
at
suppertime
i
finally
had
to
shove
staggs
out
of
the
way
being
as
polite
as
i
could
without
giving
ground
and
i
ducked
out
the
door
knocking
my
hat
sideways
and
i
and
when
i
run
to
the
side
of
the
house
there
was
badger
fifty
foot
up
the
slope
carrying
my
whipsaw
over
his
big
fat
shoulder
and
the
crockful
of
quicksilver
in
his
other
hand
i
grabbed
the
ax
off
of
my
wheelbarrow
not
wanting
to
go
empty
handed
and
lit
off
after
him
and
i
says
mr
badger
not
yelling
so
s
to
keep
everybody
else
from
getting
worked
up
it
being
my
belief
that
the
fewer
folks
involved
in
a
fight
the
shorter
it
s
likely
to
be
he
stopped
looking
surprised
and
shifty
eyed
and
mad
holding
the
little
crock
behind
his
deerskin
leggings
in
case
i
had
nt
seen
it
and
then
he
put
on
as
good
a
face
as
he
could
since
he
did
nt
have
but
two
choices
run
or
talk
and
running
s
hard
work
i
believe
you
ve
got
something
of
mine
there
i
says
stopped
two
steps
off
there
was
a
little
pine
grove
a
few
yards
up
ahead
them
and
lost
our
elbow
room
he
grinned
on
one
side
of
his
face
and
says
just
going
to
saw
me
a
couple
planks
boy
long
as
you
was
nt
using
it
i
seen
a
stack
of
rough
cut
six
foot
long
sluice
boxes
the
kind
i
d
seen
tore
out
of
the
miner
s
own
book
and
nailed
up
at
the
generalstore
back
home
and
a
couple
of
sawhorses
but
badger
had
nt
been
heading
for
them
but
off
slantways
into
the
woods
and
i
says
you
did
nt
ask
my
leave
people
do
nt
have
time
to
go
through
all
that
neighborly
talk
way
out
here
he
says
and
no
sheriff
to
learn
them
how
he
looked
at
my
ax
you
fixing
to
chop
some
wood
i
felt
ashamed
about
that
ax
he
was
a
whole
lot
fatter
than
me
but
no
taller
and
after
all
that
walking
and
hauling
i
was
as
strong
as
i
was
ever
going
to
be
you
was
a
mind
to
but
the
whipsaw
was
a
mean
looking
chunk
of
steel
with
teeth
as
big
as
a
bobcat
s
and
five
foot
long
from
handle
to
handle
and
i
did
nt
fancy
being
mistook
for
no
pine
tree
so
i
just
hefted
the
ax
to
show
him
i
knew
which
end
was
which
and
says
yes
sir
i
was
and
i
reckon
i
ll
need
that
whipsaw
to
go
with
it
and
my
quicksilver
too
if
you
do
nt
mind
he
looked
down
at
that
heavy
little
crock
as
if
he
d
forgot
all
about
it
i
just
borried
a
taste
of
this
jam
to
sweeten
up
the
sawing
ai
nt
had
a
taste
of
jam
in
eight
months
badger
i
heard
old
zack
s
voice
yelling
from
back
by
the
hut
but
i
did
nt
let
my
eyes
stray
off
here
you
can
have
it
back
badger
says
holding
the
crock
out
a
short
ways
if
you
want
i
could
see
i
was
going
to
have
to
get
too
close
to
him
and
though
that
meant
be
could
nt
swing
the
saw
good
i
did
nt
fancy
rassling
with
nobody
that
fat
i
says
i
d
be
much
obliged
if
you
d
just
bring
both
them
things
back
to
my
wheelbarrow
and
put
them
the
way
they
was
well
who
was
your
slave
last
year
boy
he
says
flexing
the
saw
by
one
handle
and
making
it
sing
goddamn
it
leave
me
alone
zack
yells
back
behind
me
but
i
did
nt
turn
to
look
you
re
mean
just
like
your
brother
badger
says
grinning
i
reckon
i
ll
make
you
fight
me
for
this
trash
here
just
to
teach
you

the
bad
things
that
could

any

now
hoping
she
might
mention
that
nobody
said
anything
i
still
keep
thinking
they
will
i
did
nt
get
my
dime
s
worth
what
became
of
her
nothing
she
is
still
a
dull
plain
child
in
my
archives
that
s
the
way
she
stops
the
branches
of
my
family
have
grown
apart
i
can
kick
myself
for
fumbling
all
those
pricelesschances
i
had
with
virginia
at
the
office
for
more
than
half
a
year
and
with
a
couple
of
girl
scout
sisters
i
knew
from
high
school
earlier
i
thought
they
were
only
kidding
in
their
giggling
insinuations
and
they
were
having
genuine
sex
parties
with
older
boys
from
tougher
neighborhoods
who
would
crash
parties
in
our
neighborhood
they
had
not
been
invited
to
and
break
them
up
it
was
rumored
they
raped
girls
seeing
my
big
brother
with
his
fly
open
on
the
floor
of
that
shadowy
coal
shed
beside
our
brick
apartment
house
with
a
kid
named
billy
foster
s
skinny
kid
sister
who
was
in
my
own
class
in
grade
school
but
not
as
smart
my
big
brother
was
nt
even
that
big
then
had
nipples
you
could
notice
but
no
breasts
but
was
doing
was
in
geography
history
or
math
but
was
going
all
the
way
already
with
guys
as
old
and
big
as
my
big
brother
while
i
was
nt
even
jerking
off
yet
abusing
and
browbeating
my
children
i
have
seen
them
turn
dumbfounded
and
aghast
when
they
thought
i
was
annoyed
ob
served
how
insurmountable
their
plight
in
trying
to
talk
normally
their
heart
clogs
their
mouth
i
see
them
trembling
in
such
debilitating
anxiety
and
want
to
hit
them
for
being
so
weak
later
i
condemn
myself
and
am
even
angrier
at
them
dishonoring
my
wife
i
no
longer
want
to
tyrannize
her
and
i
try
not
to
make
passes
at
anyone
who
knows
her
capitulating
in
craven
weakness
and
camouflaged
shame
so
often
in
the
past
to
my
possessive
domineering
mother
in
law
who
bossed
me
around
a
lot
in
the
beginning
while
i
had
to
make
believe
she
did
nt
and
my
shrewish
domineering
sister
in
law
who
is
pinched
and
nasty
now
and
whose
face
is
drying
up
peach
pit
for
surrendering
so
totally
despairingly
fatalistically
to
broad
and
overbearing
unforgettable
mrs
yerger
in
the
automobile
casualty
insurance
company
who
towered
over
me
then
it
seemed
and
comes
to
mind
always
now
when
i
m
fuming
over
derek
s
nurse
i
do
nt
know
why
we
call
her
a
nurse
she
does
no
nursing
she
s
a
caretaker
she
takes
care
of
my
mentally
retarded
son
when
she
hove
into
view
like
a
smirking
battleship
moving
out
of
one
indistinct
department
of
the
company
to
take
command
of
the
file
room
i
knew
on
sight
with
a
chill
in
my
blood
and
bones
and
a
feeling
of
frost
on
my
fingertips
that
she
would
fire
me
soon
if
i
did
nt
quit
sooner
and
again
and
again
for
fumbling
it
so
thoroughly
with
luscious
busty
virginia
back
there
in
the
office
i
worked
in
as
a
dumb
shy
frightened
and
idiotically
ingenuous
virgin
little
boy
who
felt
like
a
waif
and
sometimes
worse
what
a
dope
i
was
do
one
i
know
in
this
whole
world
who
will
have
an
inkling
of
what
i
am
talking
about
virginia
might
understand
but
virginia
will
not
be
in
earshot
when
i
lose
control
of
my
reason
in
senility
or
delirium
and
begin
pressing
upon
strangers
such
puzzles
of
ancient
germinal
importance
to
me
as
do
you
remember
mrs
yerger
i
remember
mrs
yerger
and
i
remember
virginia
is
dead
too
now
and
would
be
a
peeling
water
bag
of
emphysema
and
phlebitis
if
she
were
not
what
a
feeble
minded
idiot
i
could
have
had
her
then
she
was
hot
i
was
petrified
what
in
hell
was
inhibiting
me
so
long
strangulating
me
no
wonder
when
i
finally
tore
free
it
was
with
a
vengeance
the
company
is
still
there
she
is
nt
it
has
nt
grown
nobody
ever
hears
of
it
everybody
hears
of
this
one
and
life
has
pretty
much
been
one
damned
sterile
office
desk
after
another
for
me
ever
since
apart
from
the
army
what
a
deal
i
blew
i
was
a
moron
i
have
laid
my
wife
on
the
desk
of
my
study
more
than
once
and
on
the
desk
in
my
office
in
the
city
one
sunday
afternoon
while
the
kids
were
off
on
their
own
watching
the
holiday
show
at
the
radio
city
music
hall
they
thought
that
was
corny
what
good
tits
i
could
have
been
nibbling
on
all
those
months
instead
of
those
soggy
canned
salmon
and
tomato
or
baloney
and
mustard
sandwiches
my
mother
made
for
me
to
take
to
the
city
for
lunch
to
save
money
i
enjoyed
those
sandwiches
too
i
d
lick
her
lips
and
large
breasts
now
with
my
salmon
and
tomato
tongue
no
i
would
nt
everything
would
be
the
same
if
i
had
her
now
and
i
was
the
one
who
was
older
i
would
probably
be
calculating
my
ass
off
trying
to
keep
free
of
her
squirm
loose
unscarred
with
a
fairly
clear
conscience
as
i
find
myself
doing
habitually
with
all
my
pattys
and
even
with
my
slim
smiling
tall
supple
very
young
jane
a
kid
my
refreshing
new
temptation
in
the
art
department
who
would
be
putty
in
my
hands
but
how
long
can
you
remain
entranced
with
putty
i
break
dates
with
girls
with
the
same
proud
feelings
of
accomplishment
enjoy
when
i
make
them
it
is
easier
to
break
dates
than
keep
them
and
takes
up
less
time
all
we
really
have
is
time
what
we
do
nt
have
is
what
to
do
with
it
so
i
make
dates
most
of
my
girls
have
been
very
good
to
me
that
s
what
i
feel
girls
are
for
but
i
do
nt
want
to
see
any
of
them
frequently
and
ca
nt
bear
jadi
asked
him
to
come
to
their
hogan
her
cool
attitude
toward
him
to
be
the
lack
of
proper
introductions
and
his
face
burned
with
shame
at
his
forwardness
jadi
s
father
was
a
squat
man
broad
in
the
shoulders
and
jovial
in
appearance
he
was
definitely
henpecked
by
his
more
aggressive
wife
who
despised
his
lighthearted
attitude
but
reveled
in
the
wealth
he
had
so
easily
accumulated
when
younger
he
had
been
called
slim
by
the
white
men
and
the
name
stuck
added
to
slim
was
a
second
name
of
his
choice
joe
chief
knew
the
heavy
man
thereafter
as
joe
slim
the
dominant
ruler
of
the
large
family
was
like
a
sleeping
dog
ready
to
growl
in
its
sleep
at
any
disturbance
quick
to
snap
when
awakened
chief
decided
she
must
have
been
on
her
best
behavior
at
the
squaw
dance
the
social
activity
mellowing
her
menacing
snarl
he
forgot
her
given
name
soon
after
he
learned
it
and
referred
to
her
in
his
mind
thereafter
as
sally
jane
she
so
reminded
him
of
hatch
s
quarrelsome
wives
was
aware
of
the
mother
s
scrutinizing
glances
in
his
direction
joe
slim
was
content
to
inquire
after
his
health
but
not
so
his
wife
she
knew
why
he
had
come
but
she
was
not
ready
to
relinquish
her
daughter
to
just
anyone
the
girl
was
worth
many
fine
presents
the
greedy
mother
calculated
chief
s
presence
intently
the
memory
of
the
silver
and
turquoise
belt
impressed
on
her
mind
joe
slim
his
curiosity
aroused
allowed
his
wife
her
rude
questioning
but
visibly
showing
his
approval
of
this
young
man
he
admitted
this
to
chief
freely
jadi
having
been
sent
away
as
soon
as
she
introduced
chief
s
presence
the
woman
pried
into
his
background
chief
being
cautious
to
answer
as
he
thought
she
would
like
why
are
not
your
parents
here
to
make
proper
arrangements
instead
of
you
i
have
no
parents
or
relatives
that
are
close
where
are
your
parents
and
people
living
chief
knew
this
woman
would
scorn
his
mixed
blood
my
father
lived
on
navajo
mountain
my
mother
came
from
elk
mountain
north
of
the
river
a
heavy
silence
fell
as
the
woman
considered
this
new
development
perhaps
if
he
were
wealthy
this
parentage
would
not
be
so
important
no
one
else
need
know
do
you
have
other
line
horses
like
the
one
you
ride
chief
knew
he
was
defeated
he
did
not
have
anything
to
give
in
return
for
the
girl
he
wanted
to
take
as
his
wife
though
he
felt
she
was
worth
the
world
it
would
take
him
many
long
months
maybe
years
to
accumulate
enough
fortune
to
buy
her
still
unashamed
at
his
poverty
he
answered
the
woman
my
riches
are
in
my
heart
and
mind
joe
slim
looked
at
the
prospective
groom
with
approval
mixed
with
sadness
chief
would
make
a
fine
husband
for
his
favorite
daughter
but
it
was
not
his
place
to
give
the
couple
their
right
to
marry
and
his
wife
would
never
allow
it
i
have
ventured
joe
as
he
looked
sideways
at
his
wife
would
you
accept
the
palomino
chief
asked
hope
mixed
with
despair
at
the
thought
of
parting
with
his
golden
companion
just
one
snorted
the
woman
is
that
all
you
consider
my
daughter
worth
suddenly
this
bargaining
took
on
a
new
meaning
to
chief
it
was
much
more
than
a
means
of
obtaining
a
wife
it
also
placed
the
man
s
opinion
of
her
worth
i
ll
give
you
ten
horses
equal
to
lightning
if
you
will
allow
me
one
year
chief
stated
the
woman
s
eyes
gleamed
at
the
prospect
never
had
she
heard
of
such
an
offer
but
on
second
thought
how
did
this
youth
propose
to
acquire
that
many
horses
in
so
short
a
time
what
could
she
lose
by
agreeing
if
he
did
nt
someone
else
might
agreed
one
year
chief
left
the
hogan
unaware
of
his
surroundings
he
was
not
worthy
willing
to
give
everything
he
could
ever
possess
for
her
even
ten
horses
was
not
enough
jadi
was
again
with
the
sheep
as
chief
looked
at
her
in
the
distance
he
felt
a
deep
longing
and
despair
at
being
so
utterly
incapable
of
having
what
he
desired
most
if
only
he
could
ride
over
and
take
her
away
with
him
they
could
live
forever
in
happiness
but
it
would
not
he
happiness
until
he
could
prove
his
love
as
he
had
promised
he
must
leave
knowing
he
might
never
see
her
again
unless
he
could
find
a
job
better
than
any
he
had
ever
had
thus
far
lie
had
never
felt
so
alone
since
his
mother
died
that
deep
hurt
would
never
heal
and
chief
was
determined
not
to
add
any
more
pain
to
his
already
heavy
heart
as
he
directed
lightning
toward
bluff
chief
was
thinking
about
tomorrow
and
where
to
find
a
job
in
over
six
thousand
head
of
cattle
grazed
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
blue
mountains
and
the
quaking
aspen
and
clumped
oaks
sheltered
cool
mountain
streams
bordered
by
abundant
grazing
providing
a
fat
and
comfortable
life
for
the
animals
comparable
to
the
variety
in
size
and
shape
of
the
cattle
were
their
colorful
owners
mavericks
in
their
own
right
they
had
come
to
the
safety
of
remote
blue
mountain
country
exulting
in
the
wealthy
land
that
received
them
one
of
the
more
successful
ranchers
was
an
englishman
named
harold
carlisle
rumored
to
be
a
lord
the
bull
headed
man
managed
the
herds
of
the
sprawling
carlisle
ranch
with
the
aid
of
his
brother
ted
capitalizing
on
the
promises
each
situation
offered
carlisle
had
overcome
any
thought
of
hardship
or
poverty
in
this
new
land
and
was
living
grandly
on
the
toil
of
others
he
offered
various
renegades
outlaws
and
a
few
honest
men
employment
at
a
reduced
wage
in
exchange
for
the
security
isolation
provided
from
the
lawmen
and
starvation
low
as
the
pay
was
it
was
better
than
the
haphazard
jobs
he
had
stolen
he
was
carted
away
by
the
constable
pierce
dusted
himself
off
looked
around
the
wreckage
of
the
office
and
apologized
to
the
clerks
and
the
dispatcher
then
the
other
gentleman
who
had
joined
in
the
pursuit
said
i
fear
sir
that
you
have
missed
your
train
by
god
i
have
and
the
two
gentlemen
departed
the
one
thanking
the
other
for
helping
corner
the
thief
and
the
other
saying
it
was
nothing
leaving
the
clerks
to
clean
up
the
mess
it
was
pierce
later
reflected
a
nearly
perfect
jolly
gaff
hykey
doings
when
clean
willy
williams
the
snakesman
arrived
at
pierce
s
house
late
in
the
afternoon
of
january
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
very
strange
spectacle
in
the
drawing
room
pierce
wearing
a
red
velvet
smoking
jacket
lounged
in
an
easy
chair
smoking
a
cigar
utterly
relaxed
a
stopwatch
in
his
hands
in
contrast
agar
in
shirtsleeves
stood
in
the
center
of
thei
the
keysroom
agar
was
bent
into
a
kind
of
half
crouch
he
was
watching
pierce
and
panting
slightly
are
you
ready
pierce
said
agar
nodded
go
pierce
said
and
flicked
the
stopwatch
to
clean
willy
s
amazement
agar
dashed
across
the
room
to
the
fireplace
where
he
began
to
moving
in
a
low
whisper
seven
eight
nine
that
s
it
pierce
said
door
door
agar
said
and
in
pantomime
turned
the
handle
on
an
unseen
door
he
then
took
three
steps
to
the
right
and
reached
up
to
shoulder
height
touching
something
in
the
air
cabinet
pierce
said
cabinet
now
agar
fished
two
wax
flats
out
of
his
pocket
and
pretended
to
make
an
impression
of
a
key
time
he
asked
thirty
one
pierce
said
agar
proceeded
to
make
a
second
impression
on
a
second
set
of
flats
all
the
while
counting
to
himself
thirty
three
thirty
four
thirty
five
again
he
reached
into
the
air
with
both
hands
as
if
closing
something
cabinet
shut
he
said
and
took
three
paces
back
across
the
room
door
agar
said
and
ran
in
place
once
more
and
then
sprinted
across
the
room
to
halt
beside
pierce
s
chair
done
he
cried
pierce
looked
at
the
watch
and
shook
his
head
sixtynine
he
puffed
on
his
cigar
well
agar
said
in
a
wounded
tone
it
s
better
than
it
was
what
was
the
last
time
your
last
time
was
seventy
three
well
it
s
better
but
not
good
enough
maybe
if
you
do
nt
close
thehykey
doings
cabinet
and
do
nt
hang
up
the
keys
either
willy
can
do
that
do
what
willy
said
watching
open
and
close
the
cabinet
pierce
said
agar
went
back
to
his
starting
position
ready
pierce
said
ready
agar
said
once
again

and
be

clean
willy
nodded
what
s
for
dinner
he
said
chapter
breaking
the
drumon
the
evening
of
january
th
a
characteristic
london
pea
soup
fog
heavily
mixed
with
soot
blanketed
the
town
clean
willy
williams
easing
down
tooley
street
one
eye
to
the
facade
of
london
bridge
station
was
not
sure
he
liked
the
fog
it
made
his
movements
on
the
ground
less
noticeable
but
it
was
so
dense
that
he
could
not
see
the
second
story
of
the
terminus
building
and
he
was
worried
about
access
to
the
roof
it
would
nt
do
to
make
the
climb
halfway
only
to
discover
it
not
drive
on
without
pay
ment
of
twenty
five
dollars
or
by
presenting
a
pass
indicating
that
he
was
a
resident
of
the
city
this
is
a
public
thoroughfare
walker
said
i
ve
traveled
it
dozens
of
times
and
no
one
has
ever
said
anything
about
a
toll
he
got
up
behind
the
wheel
tell
the
chief
one
of
the
men
said
to
another
walker
decided
to
put
the
ford
into
reverse
gear
back
up
to
the
corner
and
go
another
way
he
turned
in
his
seat
at
this
moment
two
of
the
firemen
carrying
a
twenty
foot
ladder
between
them
came
into
the
street
behind
the
car
two
others
followed
with
an
other
ladder
and
others
came
out
with
carts
of
coiled
hose
buckets
axes
hooks
and
other
fire
fighting
equipment
all
of
which
was
deposited
in
the
street
the
company
having
chosen
this
particular
moment
to
sweep
out
its
quarters
the
chief
of
wore
at
a
cocky
angle
he
was
also
somewhat
older
than
the
rest
he
was
courteous
to
coalhouse
and
ex
plained
that
while
the
toll
had
never
before
been
collected
from
him
it
was
nevertheless
in
force
and
that
if
coalhouse
did
not
pay
up
he
would
not
pass
with
his
two
hands
he
lifted
his
hat
from
his
head
and
reset
it
so
that
the
visor
covered
his
eyes
this
caused
him
to
tilt
his
chin
upwards
in
order
to
see
giving
him
a
pugnacious
look
he
was
a
heavyset
man
with
thick
arms
many
of
the
volunteers
were
grinning
we
need
the
money
for
a
firetruck
the
chief
explained
so
we
can
drive
to
fires
just
like
you
drive
to
whorehouses
the
negro
calmly
considered
the
courses
of
action
available
to
him
the
emerald
isle
firehouse
looked
across
the
street
to
an
open
field
that
sloped
down
to
a
pond
conceivably
he
might
drive
off
the
road
turn
in
the
field
and
circumnavigate
the
ladders
and
hose
cart
but
he
was
wedged
wheel
hard
enough
to
clear
the
horses
the
severe
angle
of
the
turn
might
tilt
the
car
over
on
the
downhill
slope
apparently
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
ingratiate
himself
in
the
fashion
of
his
race
playing
down
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
were
a
couple
of
negro
boys
ten
or
twelve
years
old
hey
coalhouse
walker
called
to
them
come
on
up
here
the
boys
came
running
they
stared
at
coalhouse
as
he
switched
off
the
engine
set
the
brake
and
stepped
down
to
the
road
i
want
you
to
watch
this
car
he
told
them
when
i
come
back
you
tell
me
if
anyone
touched
it
the
musician
quickly
strode
back
to
the
corner
and
headed
toward
the
business
district
after
ten
minutes
he
found
a
policeman
operating
a
stop
and
go
traffic
signal
the
policeman
listened
to
his
complaint
and
shook
his
head
and
spent
some
time
removing
his
handkerchief
from
under
his
frock
coat
and
blowing
his
nose
those
boys
do
nt
mean
no
harm
he
finally
said
i
re
probably
tired
of
the
sport
walker
may
have
realized
this
was
probably
the
maximum
support
he
could
expect
from
a
policeman
at
the
same
time
he
may
have
wondered
if
he
d
been
oversensitive
to
what
was
intended
as
no
more
than
a
prank
so
he
went
back
to
firehouse
lane
the
fire
engine
and
horses
were
withdrawn
the
road
was
empty
of
volunteers
and
his
car
stood
off
the
road
in
the
field
ile
made
his
way
to
the
car
it
was
spattered
with
mud
theree
l
doctorow
was
a
six
inch
tear
in
the
custom
pantasote
top
and
deposited
in
the
back
seat
was
a
mound
of
fresh
human
excrement
he
went
across
the
street
to
the
firehouse
door
standing
there
with
his
arms
folded
was
the
chief
in
his
white
military
cap
and
green
bohemian
tie
the
police
department
advises
me
there
is
no
toll
road
anywhere
in
this
city
coalhouse
walker
said
that
s
right
said
the
chief
anyone
is
free
to
come
and
go
on
this
road
anytime
he
the
electric
lights
were
on
inside
the
firehouse
through
the
glass
panels
in
the
door
the
negro
could
see
the
three
matching
grays
in
their
stalls
the
great
nickel
plated
pumper
with
its
brass
fittings
backed
up
to
the
rear
wall
i
want
my
car
cleaned
and
the
damage
paid
for
he
said
the
chief
began
to
laugh
and
a
couple
of
his
men
came
out
to
join
the
fun
at
this
moment
a
police
van
drove
up
it
carried
two
officers
one
of
them
the
traffic
policeman
to
whom
coalhouse
walker
had
appealed
he
went
into
the
field
looked
at
the
car
and
came
back
to
the
firehouse
willie
the
policeman
said
to
the
fire
chief
did
you
or
your
boys
do
any
desecratin
i
ll
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
the
chief
said
the
nigger
here
parked
his
damn
car
in
the
middle
of
the
road
right
in
front
of
the
firehouse
we
had
to
move
it
it
s
a
serious
business
blocking
a
fire
station
ai
nt
that
so
policeman
came
to
a
decision
he
took
coal
house
aside
listen
he
said
we
ll
push
your
tin
lizzie
back
on
the
road
and
you
be
on
your
way
there
s
no
real
damage
scrape
off
the
shit
and
forget
the
whole
thing
i
was
on
my
way
when
they
stopped
me
coalhouse
said
they
put
filth
in
my
car
and
tore
a
hole
in
the
top
i
want
the
car
cleaned
and
the
damage
paid
for
the
officer
had
now
begun
to
appreciate
coalhouse
s
style
of
speech
his
dress
and
the
phenomenon
of
his
owning
a
car
in
the
first
place
he
grew
angry
if
you
do
nt
take
your
automobile
and
get
along
out
of
here
he
said
loudly
i
m
going
to
charge
you
with
driving
off
the
road
drunkenness
and
making
an
unsightly
nuisance
i
do
not
drink
coalhouse
said
i
did
not
thought
this
signified
something
of
had
drawn
the
best
lodging
in
town
drawn
he
knew
was
not
the
right
word
there
was
no
lottery
no
choosing
by
means
of
long
and
short
straws
he
had
been
offered
by
the
widow
culligan
the
loft
room
in
her
pendleton
home
she
had
ignored
the
general
ignored
patrick
conroy
originally
like
herself
from
the
old
sod
given
noah
beazley
the
very
picture
of
a
dark
and
handsome
city
lawyer
the
go
by
she
had
offered
the
room
to
charlie
because
she
told
him
you
look
like
my
late
son
charlie
reminded
them
of
their
late
husbands
reminding
a
widow
of
her
late
son
was
more
to
his
liking
he
moved
into
the
widow
s
loft
room
at
once
without
wasting
time
or
pity
on
his
fellow
lawyers
they
the
general
among
them
were
piled
two
in
a
bed
in
less
commodious
lodgings
the
feathers
of
the
ticking
and
comforters
he
slept
between
smelled
sweet
and
fresh
some
heat
spilled
into
the
room
from
the
fireplace
chimney
that
took
up
one
end
of
the
loft
he
had
that
frontier
luxury
a
looking
glass
spotted
to
be
sure
like
a
pond
with
lily
pads
but
between
the
spots
he
could
see
his
own
face
he
doubted
he
looked
like
the
late
son
charles
fort
he
had
been
told
you
re
an
oddity
not
a
mud
fence
ugly
oddity
kisses
had
told
him
that
but
no
one
else
s
spit
and
image
for
sure
he
was
dish
faced
with
a
head
of
fine
black
hair
that
a
brisk
big
round
and
set
shal
low
in
his
head
were
the
color
of
water
in
a
rain
barrel
neither
blue
nor
gray
his
nose
did
nt
have
much
of
a
bridge
but
it
made
up
for
the
lack
at
the
top
by
flaring
out
into
race
horse
nostrils
at
the
bottom
he
bared
his
teeth
to
the
glass
nothing
lacking
there
he
could
bite
with
a
beaver
he
was
longheaded
and
a
trifle
lanternjawed
but
his
long
head
was
set
on
a
stud
horse
neck
a
neck
broad
as
his
face
at
the
cheekbones
the
looking
glass
did
nt
show
him
below
the
adam
s
apple
but
he
knew
what
was
there
a
body
wideshouldered
spare
in
the
short
ribs
and
waist
and
supported
by
thighs
heavy
and
meaty
like
his
neck
i
m
no
adonis
charlie
admitted
to
himself
but
who
needed
looks
when
he
had
luck
he
got
good
horses
at
livery
stables
helpings
from
the
first
serving
at
boardinghouses
and
whiskey
from
taverns
the
secretary
of
war
himself
or
at
least
the
general
had
asked
that
he
come
to
pendleton
on
this
historic
case
the
widow
offered
him
her
spare
room
because
he
with
a
face
like
no
one
else
s
looked
like
her
son
when
his
family
had
been
killed
by
indians
as
they
were
moving
from
kentucky
to
ohio
he
the
sole
survivor
age
two
had
been
found
carried
into
cincinnati
and
adopted
there
by
the
man
he
thought
of
as
father
enoch
leverett
leverett
had
sent
him
east
to
harvard
where
the
bright
yankee
boys
went
planning
for
him
to
take
over
the
leverett
newspaper
the
western
spy
when
he
graduated
in
spite
of
himself
charlie
turned
out
to
be
a
lawyer
a
newspaper
writer
has
to
tone
things
down
charlie
had
watched
leverett
do
this
for
years
a
lawyer
could
tear
the
rag
off
the
bush
could
tell
the
jury
facts
that
would
lose
an
editor
every
subscriber
he
had
charlie
s
mouth
that
and
so
made
use
of
what
charlie
could
do
send
him
facts
that
he
could
cut
dress
up
water
down
add
to
until
they
were
fit
for
print
beneath
the
spotted
looking
glass
when
charlie
had
moved
into
the
room
was
a
deal
table
holding
washbowl
pitcher
soap
dish
and
drinking
glass
the
room
had
no
washstand
the
chamberpot
was
under
the
bed
charlie
took
all
this
paraphernalia
from
the
table
moved
the
table
under
the
loft
s
one
window
and
had
himself
a
desk
he
brought
a
rush
bottomed
chair
upstairs
put
his
paper
newly
sharpened
quill
and
newly
mixed
ink
on
the
table
and
sat
down
to
write
enoch
leverett
what
he
had
promised
a
report
of
this
outlandish
place
and
of
this
outrageous
trial
he
knew
the
western
spy
was
nt
interested
in
how
charlie
fort
was
making
out
amongst
the
woodsies
and
redskins
he
did
nt
begin
his
writing
with
dear
pa
that
would
lead
him
into
a
redheaded
girl
he
had
seen
who
had
made
him
want
to
follow
her
into
the
green
gloom
of
the
unending
stands
of
trees
the
way
men
run
after
fox
fire
in
a
swamp
he
wrote
in
what
he
considered
a
newspaper
style
but
for
a
newspaper
whose
sole
reader
was
enoch
leverett
he
said
pendleton
had
a
population
of
two
hundred
souls
not
people
that
was
newspaper
lingo
but
he
could
nt
bring
himself
to
substitute
we
for
i
we
saw
what
other
pair
of
eyes
saw
what
he
saw
no
he
was
nt
that
much
of
a
reporter
extracts
from
a
letter
by
charles
fort
to
enoch
leverett
pendleton
is
a
town
of
two
hundred
souls
i
made
the
mistake
when
i
first
arrived
here
of
calling
pendleton
a
settlement
the
pendletonians
wasted
no
time
setting
me
right
on
that
score
a
settlement
is
a
place
like
fall
creek
twenty
miles
upriver
no
stores
streets
or
taverns
there
pendleton
is
a
town
my
idea
three
thousand
books
in
our
library
board
walks
street
lights
i
doubt
if
half
a
dozen
books
could
be
scared
up
in
this
entire
settlement
excuse
me
i
mean
town
excluding
of
course
the
good
book
they
own
that
even
if
they
do
nt
always
follow
it
as
the
recent
murders
prove
on
my
first
day
here
i
was
told
that
i
was
expected
at
midday
to
take
dinner
with
judge
giddings
three
judges
sit
here
a
presiding
judge
appointed
place
chantry
suddenly
changed
his
tone
this
is
land
bought
legally
from
the
indians
when
the
time
is
right
i
ll
transfer
title
to
it
long
after
they
had
me
inside
and
in
bed
i
heard
the
murmur
of
her
voice
out
there
with
them
she
was
nt
blonde
with
golden
curls
and
all
but
she
was
pretty
she
was
almighty
beautiful
and
twenty
be
seventeen
and
i
was
a
man
growed
and
she
even
said
i
had
nerve
later
some
time
later
i
heard
pa
say
if
there
s
nothin
there
an
you
know
it
why
do
nt
you
just
tell
em
i
tried
to
they
believe
too
hard
kernohan
men
will
give
up
anything
rather
than
what
they
want
to
believe
and
hate
you
for
telling
them
there
s
nothing
to
believe
and
even
if
you
prove
it
to
them
they
ll
continue
to
believe
and
hate
you
for
proving
them
foolish
sometimes
they
give
up
but
they
ll
like
you
no
more
i
ve
seen
men
come
to
a
ground
where
treasure
was
said
to
be
buried
and
with
holes
all
over
the
hills
they
ll
dig
another
one
and
then
another
one
thing
i
know
my
brother
was
here
for
some
time
if
there
was
anything
of
value
here
he
would
have
found
it
would
leave
some
clue
chantry
paused
moreover
knowing
him
he
would
probably
leave
such
a
clue
as
only
i
would
be
apt
to
discover
what
kinda
clue
could
that
be
chantry
shrugged
i
will
have
to
remember
what
passed
between
us
and
which
of
my
tastes
he
knew
best
clive
was
a
fine
man
a
much
better
man
than
i
in
every
moral
way
but
he
had
a
complicated
mind
and
so
have
i
and
any
clue
he
left
would
be
useful
to
no
one
else
well
said
pa
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
nt
figger
out
what
kinda
clue
or
how

i
i
ve
got
to
go
back
marny
said
chantry
turned
toward
her
do
nt
stay
here

got
to
go
back
at

one
more
time

they

they

maybe
i

be
there
alone
against
them
all
i
wo
nt
be
inside
i
ll
keep
some
freedom
of
action
i
heard
chantry
walk
across
the
room
yes
i
think
i
must
do
that
i
must
be
there
when
they
come
i
want
to
keep
that
cabin
it
s
lonely
pa
said
it
s
a
mighty
lonely
place
of
a
wintertime
a
man
could
be
snowed
in
that
house
must
be
nine
thousand
feet
up
i
ve
been
up
high
before
i
never
seen
her
go
she
just
taken
off
and
was
gone
when
i
waked
up
with
only
the
but
i
was
scared
for
her
scared
i
had
a
bad
feeling
about
her
going
back
i
tried
to
sit
up
and
got
such
a
stab
of
pain
in
my
side
that
i
laid
down
quick
gasping
for
breath
she
was
gone
there
was
nothin
i
could
do
if
i
just
had
my
old
rifle
and
was
up
in
them
rocks
well
maybe
i
could
nt
do
nothin
but
could
surely
try
suddenly
chantry
stood
over
me
you
all
right
doby
i
heard
you
cry
out
did
nt
mean
to
yeah
i
m
all
right
but
i
wish
you
d
bring
her
back
that
s
a
bad
outfit
i
wish
you
d
fetch
her
owen
chantry
i
ll
be
at
the
cabin
she
knows
that
if
she
ever
gets
there
mr
chantry
i
m
scared
i
m
plumb
scared
for
her
she
do
nt
think
they
knew
she
knowed
there
chantry
looked
grim
and
he
had
a
face
for
it
he
was
a
right
handsome
man
but
there
was
a
coldness
in
him
sometimes
that
would
frighten
a
man
i
ll
just
go
see
doby
i
ll
ride
up
there
right
now
today
he
wasted
no
time
he
got
on
the
big
black
and
taken
his
packhorse
and
headed
for
the
hills
and
seein
him
ride
out
i
wondered
what
would
happen
when
him
and
the
mowatts
come
together
maybe
he
was
only
one
man
and
they
was
many
but
she
sure
would
nt
be
no
one
sided
fight
not
with
him
being
the
other
side
no
matter
how
many
they
had
there
was
soinethin
about
that
man
that
made
you
believe
even
me
who
up
til
then
had
nt
wanted
to
believe
much
of
anything
bout
owen
chantry
somehow
busted
ribs
and
all
i
had
to
be
there
i
had
to
be
up
on
that
mountain
when
man
without
illusions
nothing
in
his
experience
had
given
him
the
idea
that
he
was
protected
by
any
special
dispensation
from
providence
he
had
seen
good
men
die
when
the
evil
lived
on
and
he
was
aware
that
he
was
as
vulnerable
as
any
other
man
yet
a
man
does
nt
command
a
cavalry
outfit
scout
for
the
army
against
the
indians
drive
a
stage
and
ride
shotgun
without
acquiring
a
feeling
for
the
possibilities
chantry
s
life
was
due
to
his
own
skill
and
to
a
certain
amount
of
sheer
coincidence
for
if
he
was
a
foot
past
the
spot
where
bullets
struck
it
was
only
circumstance
and
the
fact
that
he
was
moving
faster
or
slower
than
the
men
the
bullets
found
owen
chantry
had
asked
no
favors
of
destiny
he
put
himself
in
the
hands
of
his
own
skills
a
good
horse
and
a
good
gun
crossing
the
canyon
at
a
place
where
another
canyon
joined
it
from
the
east
he
climbed
a
rough
but
not
too
difficult
trail
it
aspens
which
were
favored
by
beavers
and
elks
he
took
his
time
at
zealand
liam
answered
new
zealand
you
ca
nt
go
there
man
it
s
too
bloody
far
what
difference
does
it
make
how
far
oh
no
you
re
daft
man
conor
said
seizing
at
the
straw
we
ve
not
the
money
to
send
you
there
it
s
no
good
no
good
at
all
he
paced
and
beat
his
hand
into
his
fist
trying
to
find
one
more
straw
it
over
liam
shook
his
head
puzzled
i
ca
nt
i
ve
signed
onto
a
scheme
to
work
off
my
passage
they
ve
large
ranches
in
the
southern
half
of
the
country
and
they
need
sheepmen
farmers
and
drovers
it
will
take
two
years
to
pay
the
fare
but
then
i
ll
be
in
the
clear
i
hear
tell
there
s
land
to
be
had
so
in
another
two
or
three
years
after
i
work
my
passage
i
might
be
able
to
buy
some
of
my
own
see
there
conor
cried
it
s
a
bloody
trick
like
the
famine
ships
i
ll
not
let
you
get
into
a
scheme
like
that
once
they
get
you
there
you
ll
be
working
your
passage
for
life
that
s
it
you
ca
nt
go
liam
still
confused
over
his
brother
s
seizure
he
gestured
to
cut
it
off
it
s
a
legitimate
plan
kevin
himself
assures
me
of
that
it
big
and
we
re
being
supervised
by
the
church
kevin
has
already
sent
three
lads
out
of
derry
and
they
re
all
starting
to
do
well
conor
knelt
on
a
knee
deflated
and
his
eyes
darted
a
bit
wild
he
knew
he
d
better
calm
down
there
was
only
one
way
to
go
at
it
and
none
other
new
zealand
he
whispered
so
much
the
better
for
my
chances
liam
said
new
zealand
conor
repeated
as
though
they
were
the
heaviest
words
in
the
language
he
looked
up
to
liam
with
deliberateness
i
m
putting
something
to
you
straight
i
do
nt
want
you
to
go
i
vemy
own
trade
and
i
m
earning
almost
as
much
as
a
carriage
maker
would
you
stay
here
if
daddy
agrees
to
pass
the
farm
to
you
liam
shook
his
head
now
it
s
you
talking
daft
you

got
to
know
i
ve
never
felt
ill
of
you
because

insisted

answered
as

in
a
sweet
dream
that

all
i
ve
ever
wanted
oh
holy
mother
i
know
every
dear
inch
of
every
plot
and
every
stone
in
every
wall
conor
i
chill
all
over
with
fright
when
i
think
of
going
so
far
away
we
never
got
to
talking
about
it
because
i
did
nt
want
to
get
my
hopes
up
but
there
s
a
couple
of
lassies
looking
right
good
to
me
and
i
would
be
after
courting
one
of
them
if

oh

arms
fiercely
we

going
to
make
him
see
the
talking
i

positive
time
tomas
entered
his
cottage
and
that
wasafter
the
rosary

said
and
before

was
served
when
brigid

brigid

jumped
out
of
her
skin
as
conor

fist
all
but
split
the
table
she
d
never
seen
him
act
that
way
as
all
their
eyes
interplayed
the
sense
of
pending
battle
was
obvious

best
do
what
your
brother
says
tomas
said
softly
come
along
dary
brigid
said
haymaker
she
banged
the
door
after
herself
deliberately
the
three
men
sat
in
stone
silence
and
finola
whined
under
her
breath
as
she
shuffled
around
the
fire
liam

leaving
for
new
zealand
next
week
conor
snapped
oh
mary

finola
cried
quiet

over
the
table
so
that
he
was
nose
to
nose
with
his
father
daddy
i
m
telling

conor
continued
now

have
it
tomas
drank
again
with
deliberateness
set
the
cup
down
slowly
his
eyes
moving
from
one
son
to
the
other
you

not
be
making
decisions
that

he

and
you

conor
shouted
you

a
part
of
our
life

get
used
to
no

how
many
times

many
nights
i

lay

crying
to
be
able
to
keep
the
both

country
tomas

finola
implored

and

the
light

with
this
conor
cried
tomas
was
up
and
shaking
a
fist
at
his
wife
he
s
fragile
because
you
want
him
that
way
shut
up
woman
or
get
out
this
is
between
me
and
my
sons
she
shrank
into
a
corner
sobbing
tomas
heaved
a
sigh
and
went
how
it
s
got
to
be
lad
i
ll
grieve
for
do
nt
believe
this
the
kid
and
i
are
staring
at
each
other
he
is
large
and
black
i
go
back
to
eyes
winterneet
and
pavlovenka
seem
to
be
scrapping
i
tell
my
students
she
s
saying
to
write
what
they
feel
to
experiment
to
throw
off
the
tyrannical
old
forms
hear
hear
i
think
and
impose
on
the
poor
young
people
the
tyranny
of
freedom
says
winterneet
hear
hear
i
think
again
pavlovenka
worries
she
does
nt
like
people
saying
unkind
things
about
freedom
how
d
you
mean
tyranny
i
mean
it
s
hard
having
to
invent
a
free
verse
form
for
every
new
occasion
it
is
nt
hard
for
my
students
to
write
free
verse
pavlovenka
says
but
may
nt
it
be
hard
says
winterneet
his
pale
nose
pinched
eyes
gummed
by
his
recent
illness
he
turns
his
famous
bald
old
head
with
a
weary
sweetness
in
pavlovenka
s
direction
might
it
not
be
hard
forgive
me
on
their
readers
even
the
often
toward
maurie
seem
to
be
choosing
to
be
opaque
and
boring
maurie
who
seemed
to
be
dozing
in
his
chair
rouses
himself
to
say
which
brings
me
to
my
subject
why
publish
what
nobody
will
read
the
reading
public
not
to
speak
of
the
publishing
community
is
a
bunch
of
gertrudes
poor
gertrude
she
s
so
horrified
to
see
the
prince
familiarly
in
conversation
with
what
looks
to
her
exactly
like
the
empty
air
she
must
conclude
he
s
mad
or
at
best
a
put
on
artist
remember
the
little
man
who
slashed
the
early
picasso
canvases
one
concluded
he
was
mad
why
this
passion
why
not
stay
quietly
at
home
but
how
could
he
ignore
what
must
be
proved
to
be
nothing
or
prove
him
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
that
s
very
very
terrible
no
wonder
these
gertrudes
plant
the
letter
for
our
execution
in
our
pockets
and
put
us
out
to
sea
and
while
you
says
the
real
world
burns
the
speakers
along
the
table
stir
newman
overwrought
and
intense
leans
toward
maurie
who
leans
back
in
his
chair
like
some
fat
farouk
of
the
intellect
and
says
yes
his
smile
is
warm
and
his
eyes
are
spunky
but
newman
will
not
let
maurie
be
charming
he
bends
his
neck
into
a
u
and
forces
maurie
to
face
what
he
is
about
to
say
and
says
i
m
talking
about
hunger
that
s
true
i
think
dazzled
by
the
enormity
he
means
i
publish
poetry
the
world
starves
maurie
gives
the
word
its
fullest
and
slowest
weight
neither
causes
nor
prevents
the
other
and
that
s
true
too
i
think
what
you
publish
says
newman
is
an
elitist
magazine
hear
hear
says
pavlovenka
written
says
newman
by
a
couple
of
dozen
literati
read
not
even
by
each
other
says
newman
i
never
read
it
pavlovenka
assures
him
i
publish
literature
says
maurie
literature
is
elitist
newman
says
right
on
from
the
stage
manager
in
the
wings
oh
but
pavlovenka
says
what
winterneet
and
meyers
cry
is
that
true
i
wonder
are
nt
you
begins
betterwheatling
errant
crap
says
maurie
and
you
know
it
newman
while
winterneet
says
newman
is
embalming
the
sonnet
and
the
villanelle
the
stage
manager
laughs
you
do
nt
take
my
meaning
says
winterneet
with
irritable
eagerness
zeus
puts
his
mouth
close
to
my
ear
and
whispers
you
ll
have
to
pay
admission
if
you
re
going
to
enjoy
yourself
it
s
true
my
head
is
turning
from
one
to
the
other
how
beautifully
each
is
says
newman
i
jump
writes
for
her
private
prophylaxis
she
says
the
way
she
cleans
her
teeth
you
know
what
i
meant
i
cry
shocked
i
thought
i
was
on
his
side
he
s
righter
surely
than
the
rest
of
us
i
only
meant
that
writing
has
grown
as
deep
as
habit
are
nt
you
betterwheatling
tries
again
what
i
meant
winterneet
leans
toward
newman
is
that
to
refuse
forms
perfected
by
the
past
is
like
having
to
invent
the
bed
each
time
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
your
forms
says
newman
were
created
on
the
backs
of
blacks
and
women
cries
pavlovenka
are
nt
you
confusing
betterwheatling
says
i
m
talking
says
winterneet
about
the
mastery
of
technique
technique
is
racist
says
newman
its
purpose
is
to
master
slaves
promises
are
nt
you
confusing
the
realms
of
poetry
and
politics
says
betterwheatling
bending
his
neck
into
a
u
to
force
newman
s
attention
poetry
is
politics
says
newman
oh
yes
from
the
wings
meyers
leans
forward
intently
io
god
s
silent
searching
flight
when
my
lord
s
head
was
filled
with
dew
he
says
but
newman
sits
back
in
his
chair
and
laughs
into
the
audience
and
says
not
my
lord
and
all
his
locks
are
wet
with
the
clear
drops
of
night
his
still
soft
call
sings

was
yesterday

i
said

i

lachas
said
bogas

it
is
luck
and
of
hermes
five
it
is
of
no
luck
he
turned
upon
me
a
look
of
malice
the
rest
grew
grave
and
one
began
i
too
have
heard
but
the
captain
breaking
in
blustered
them
clown
you
have
heard
yea
you
have
heard
many
lies
and
believed
them
will
you
quote
me
the
cant
of
priests
and
choose
me
a
holy
number
for
a
gang
like
ours
then
to
bogas
let
no
barbarian
make
talk
of
hermes
for
the
god

be
vexed
i
tell
you
the
luck

not
of
numbers

luck
but
if
you
will
have
it
that
five
is
luckless
he
who
grumbles
shall
be
fifth
so
he
silenced
them
but
i
still
fearful
of
bogas
held
up
my
bare
hands
saying
see
lachas
i
alone
of
this
pack
am
toothless
is
it
well
he
frowned
then
laughed
and
said
tomorrow
you
shall
be
fanged
tonight
i
will
growl
beside
my
cub
and
none
shall
molest
him
he
spread
a
pallet
beside
his
own
and
there
he
bade
me
lie
and
make
no
more
talk
then
going
back
to
the
wine
he
drank
and
howled
impious
songs
and
jests
with
the
rest
till
the
sputtering
torch
had
burned
low
in
its
cleft
of
stone
at
last
unable
to
bear
more
they
reeled
to
their
beds
where
they
fell
and
lay
face
upward
with
a
snorting
as
of
crocodiles
on
mud
banks
of
nile
i
had
laid
myself
down
on
my
left
side
for
the
better
guarding
against
my
ribs
i
rejoiced
in
it
moreover
it
helped
to
keep
me
awake
and
even
so
i
had
almost
lost
myself
many
times
how
i
had
dared
to
plan
what
i
now
ventured
is
still
an
amazement
to
me
in
after
years
in
the
full
strength
of
manhood
ripened
with
perils
i
would
have
hesitated
but
the
danger
of
lingering
among
them
was
scarcely
less
and
to
lead
a
life
like
theirs
seemed
worse
than
present
death
the
silver
too
incited
me
it
was
mine
i
would
not
give
it
up
i
would
have
the
spending
of
it
at
whatever
risk
i
rose
on
my
elbow
then
to
my
knees
the
giant
beside
me
trumpeted
through
his
nose
like
that
great
beast
of
indus
ridden
by
porus
though
of
that
i
had
then
no
thought
i
reached
out
with
my
hand
with
the
tender
stealth
of
a
mother
who
would
not
wake
her
child
i
drew
a
knife
from
his
girdle
and
the
joy
of
a
weapon
filled
i
felt
the
edge
it
was
keener
than
that
with
which
i
had
slit
the
cobbler
s
leather
and
such
a
new
boldness
possessed
me
that
seeing
an
amulet
hanging
awry
from
his
neck
i
gently
cut
its
thong
and
took
it
leaning
close
to
his
face
but
i
would
not
harm
him
unless
at
utmost
need
brute
though
he
was
he
had
been
kinder
to
me
than
my
uncle
or
my
city
toward
bogas
who
lay
a
little
aloof
from
the
rest
dim
in
the
gloom
i
cast
a
look
but
turned
away
hastily
i
presumed
no
further
but
stole
out
softly
from
that
evil
place
and
as
the
fresh
wind
of
the
mountain
smote
in
my
face
i
had
a
longing
to
shout
for
very
gladness
but
i
fled
in
silence
under
the
brightening
sky
through
dusky
ravines
and
down
slopes
of
some
hazard
till
with
the
rising
sun
i
stood
on
the
edge
of
tilled
land
and
the
wide
boeotian
plain
lay
before
me
so
richer
only
in
the
wit
that
breeds
so
quickly
from
danger
for
as
i
view
it
now
i
had
left
my
boyhood
in
that
den
of
thieves
in
which
is
related
how
i
entered
the
service
of
a
tyrant
and
how
i
helped
to
deliver
a
city
of
the
years
that
followed
until
that
great
adventure
in
which
i
first
saw
doria
when
also
i
learned
the
might
of
apollo
and
what
his
favor
may
mean
to
men
i
am
not
so
proud
as
to
make
a
long
tale
of
it
yet
within
this
time
i
grew
to
the
full
four
cubits
of
manhood
of
all
statures
the
best
for
endurance
and
active
strength
so
that
my
eyes
now
looked
downward
into
the
faces
of
most
and
while
i
thus
outgrew
my
comrades
and
my
sinews
toughened
until
my
javelin
cast
at
full
stretch
with
a
thong
was
upward
of
a
hundred
paces
i
learned
in
the
hard
school
of
service
such
lessons
of
craft
and
skill
that
when
i
offered
my
spear
none
was
chosen
was
less
easy
and
once
in
thessaly
for
unasked
counsel
to
daiphantus
concerning
the
order
of
battle
i
received
on
my
shoulders
such
an
acknowledgment
from
his
staff
that
even
today
my
back
aches
at
the
thought
of
it
that
the
counsel
i
gave
was
sound
i
will
still
maintain
for
the
event
showed
it
yet
so
i
was
taught
that
in
war
one
voice
alone
must
be
heard
hence
i
mastered
the
gift
of
silence
and
of
speech
that
tells
even
less
b
t
will
of
apollo
and
learned
at
last
to
trust
none
wholly
and
living
thus
my
heart
grew
hard
with
my
body
all
this
came
slowly
like
a
soldier
s
pay
and
though
my
adventures
were
many
they
were
not
altogether
such
as
one
would
care
to
recount
in
later
days
i
shall
therefore
deal
with
these
years
of
my
schooling
in
arms
quite
curtly
as
ptolemy
treats
of
the
time
before
alexander
crossed
the
hellespont
yet
some
part
i
will
tell
when
after
my
flight
and
made
known
my
name
i
expected
to
be
made
much
of
because
of
my
father
but
in
this
i
was
sorely
disappointed
i
was
indeed
as
a
matter
of
no
consequence
allowed
to
enter
and
attention
moved
over
to
the
door
opened
it
part
way
and
peered
out
carefully
when
he
was
satisfied
he
opened
it
all
the
way
and
stood
to
one
side
the
uniformed
men
stepped
out
one
at
a
time
like
paratroopers
from
a
plane
first
leaning
then
whooshing
quickly
to
their
right
as
if
into
a
slipstream
sonnenleitner
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
them
kruse
drew
a
mauser
automatic
the
magazine
examined
it
then
clicked
it
back
into
place
when
he
looked
up
it
was
at
charity
and
with
a
smile
that
did
nothing
for
the
narrow
eyes
we
are
ready
sonnenleitner
said
when
she
turned
she
noticed
that
he
too
had
an
automatic
pistol
in
his
hand
a
walther
model
pp
they
walked
quickly
and
quietly
down
the
carpeted
corridor
charity
in
between
turning
the
corner
with
almost
comical
parade
like
precision
all
the
uniformed
men
were
in
place
all
held
their
shotguns
up
against
their
chests
in
the
position
of
present
arms
when
they
were
abreast
of
ruter
s
door
sonnenleitner
and
kruse
noiselessly
joined
the
men
pressed
up
against
the
wall
and
she
stood
there
and
waited
until
they
were
ready
when
the
detective
inspector
nodded
she
stepped
several
paces
forward
and
knocked
at
first
there
was
no
answer
then
a
muffled
wer
ist
da
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
kurt
love
it
s
me
door
i
ca
nt
find
my
watch
and
i
think
i
left
it
somewhere
in
the
room
she
did
nt
look
at
the
men
flattened
against
the
wall
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
the
door
opened
first
a
crack
and
then
a
little
more
darling
she
said
smiling
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
they
rushed
in
then
from
both
sides
sonnenleitner
pushing
her
out
of
the
way
as
he
passed
so
hard
that
she
stumbled
back
against
the
far
wall
she
did
nt
wait
to
see
how
it
turned
out
her
job
was
finished
but
she
could
nt
help
thinking
as
she
began
walking
back
down
the
corridor
that
there
was
surprisingly
little
noise
coming
from
ruter
s
room
much
less
than
she
would
have
guessed
there
d
be
when
she
came
into
view
the
manager
stopped
his
pacing
in
front
of
the
bank
of
elevators
and
stared
at
her
she
smiled
to
indicate
that
everything
was
over
your
rooms
are
too
hot
she
was
sehr
heiss
and
she
pointed
at
one
of
the
doors
too
hot
you
give
too
much
heat
it
is
very
uncomfortable
he
continued
staring
at
her
as
if
she
was
somehow
mocking
him
never
mind
she
said
walking
to
the
room
for
her
bag
leaning
into
the
thick
smoke
just
enough
to
pluck
it
out
would
you
please
get
an
elevator
for
me
it
s
safe
now
it
s
all
over
ach
yes
he
said
i
am
so
sorry
and
he
rushed
to
take
her
bag
which
he
then
carried
to
the
house
telephone
where
he
barked
a
brisk
command
it
took
only
a
few
seconds
for
the
elevator
to
arrive
and
when
it
did
he
stood
to
one
side
to
let
her
walk
in
then
handed
the
bag
to
the
operator
who
looked
to
be
about
fourteen
merry
christmas
she
said
just
before
the
doors
closed
yes
yes
merry
christmas
to
you
too
miss
bay
but
he
did
nt
put
his
heart
in
it
the
airport
in
hamburg
was
hot
too
and
all
but
empty
on
christmas
day
and
the
first
thing
she
did
once
inside
was
to
take
off
her
coat
and
drape
it
over
her
arm
there
was
only
one
agent
on
duty
at
the
lufthansa
counter
a
handsome
blond
north
german
type
with
every
gene
in
place
he
watched
her
approach
with
connoisseur
like
scrutiny
first
her
legs
then
her
breasts
and
finally
the
face
when
she
stopped
before
him
he
rewarded
her
with
a
perfect
smile
obviously
he
approved
but
the
smile
waned
somewhat
when
in
addition
to
the
passport
and
ticket
for
the
flight
she
also
removed
a
derringer
from
her
purse
broke
it
open
to
show
that
both
chambers
were
empty
and
placed
it
on
the
counter
regulations
forbid
the
carrying
of
firearms
on
board
airplanes
they
must
be
surrendered
at
the
check
in
counters
where
they
are
registered
dismantled
and
the
airline
or
customs
at
the
end
of
the
flight
you
are
much
too
beautiful
to
have
to
carry
a
gun
the
handsome
agent
said
his
guttural
accent
had
a
slight
british
flavoring
to
it
may
i
please
have
the
american
customs
form
for
this
she
said
ignoring
him
i
am
certain
that
all
a
girl
like
you
has
to
do
is
smile
to
have
the
men
come
running
he
insisted
playfully
teutonically
but
a
gun
rich
that
is
so
barbaric
so
violent
why
do
nt
you
stop
the
nonsense
and
just
hand
me
the
form
she
said
wearily
the
magnificent
face
blushed
and
the
perfect
eyes
blinked
in
disbelief
pardon
i
just
said
stop
the
nonsense
and
get
on
with
your
job
for
one
thing
i
am
not
a
girl
and
i
do
nt
like
being
referred
to
as
one
for
another
i
do
nt
want
to
carry
on
any
kind
of
are
not
my
type
and
if
there
is
any
objection
on
your
part
any
whatsoever
just
cancel
my
ticket
and
i
ll
travel
with
pan
am
or
twa
the
agent
s
face
was
beet
red
by
then
ein
moment
bitte
he
said
standing
to
his
full
height
and
then
retreating
through
a
small
door
in
the
wall
he
returned
a
few
seconds
later
with
another
perfect
type
only
one
who
was
older
and
seemed
to
have
faded
as
a
result
of
being
laundered
more
miss
bay
the
superior
said
barely
glancing
at
her
breasts
i
must
apologize
if
you
have
misunderstood
mr
kauffmann
he
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
he
merely
meant
to
be
pleasant
is
nt
that
correct
hans
hans
now
looking
hurt
and
abused
shook
his
head
life
goes
on
sarah
voskovek
a
m
it
was
about
a
quarter
to
nine
when
i
went
to
the
elevator
and
punched
the
up
button
i
doubted
that
the
hotel
chief
of
security
would
be
at
his
desk
yet
and
in
any
case
i
did
nt
know
where
his
desk
was
i
did
know
where
sarah
was
so
i
went
up
to
the
sixth
floor
undoubtedly
she
was
nt
in
yet
but
i
would
wait
a
reasonable
length
of
time
i
was
wrong
she
was
in
the
girl
at
the
outer
desk
still
was
nt
there
but
i
could
see
sarah
in
the
inner
room
i
knocked
on
the
doorjamb
and
said
hello
she
turned
saw
me
and
said
come
in
she
did
nt
smile
somehow
i
felt
smiling
did
nt
come
easy
to
her
but
she
did
nt
frown
either
she
was
wearing
a
dark
green
outfit
in
which
the
collar
stood
up
behind
to
try
to
learn
them
it
was
cut
narrow
and
low
in
front
just
low
enough
to
show
a
pleasant
cleavage
between
breasts
of
light
cream
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
for
the
morning
she
said
how
are
you
darius
you
look
a
little
worn
bad
day
followed
by
bad
night
it
s
all
right
she
changed
her
cool
expression
into
one
of
quiet
sympathy
it
s
mr
devore
s
death
of
course
yes
if
i
had
not
come
to
see
you
at
the
luncheon
what
s
the
difference
i
was
about
due
to
remember
and
something
else
would
have
kicked
it
off
if
you
had
nt
she
said
you
know
the
medical
examiner
came
at
about
seven
thirty
last
night
and
took
the
body
away
i
assumed
he
did
it
at
some
time
in
the
evening
what
happened
to
eunice
i
mean
mrs
devore
that
i
do
not
like
me
to
get
you
coffee
no
i
ve
just
had
some
what
i
d
really
like
to
do
is
to
get
say
six
hours
of
rest
in
which
my
brain
was
turned
on
to
nothing
but
rest
preferably
in
your
arms
why
i
said
it
i
do
nt
know
because
she
did
nt
appeal
to
me
but
when
you
reach
middle
age
and
have
as
checkered
a
career
with
women
as
i
have
had
these
things
come
out
without
real
planning
like
slicing
bread
even
as
i
heard
myself
say
it
i
expected
her
to
turn
icy
but
she
did
nt
rather
shockingly
she
smiled
and
sat
back
in
her
chair
well
she
said
do
nt
do
anything
that
will
get
me
fired
she
caught
me
by
surprise
and
the
moment
passed
her
muscles
tightened
and
she
was
sitting
up
in
her
chair
once
more
her
posture
excellent
but
is
there
anything
in
the
business
said
when
does
the
chief
of
security
come
in
his
name
is
even
harder
than
yours
or
i
d
call
him
by
that
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
is
marsogliani
she
pronounced
it
mahr
soh
lyah
nee
which
is
how
i
tried
to
say
it
afterward
he
s
usually
quite
early
but
i
do
nt
know
if
he
s
arrived
and
if
he
has
arrived
he
may
not
be
at
his
desk
is
it
that
you
want
to
see
him
she
asked
lapsing
into
non
english
word
order
which
just
made
her
sound
cuter
quite
a
lot
i
said
she
shrugged
i
ll
call
him
for
you
but
you
know
he
was
a
little
annoyed
with
you
yesterday
did
he
tell
you
why
he
said
you
were
a
busybody
no
details
i
am
a
busybody
i
said
at
least
right
now
i
am
for
instance
depends
is
there
a
drug
problem
at
the
hotel
drug
problem
i
mean
is
the
hotel
involved
in
some
way
in
the
sale
or
distribution
of
drugs
dope
heroin
certainly
not
all
right
not
the
hotel
but
is
it
taking
place
here
without
the
hotel
s
connivance
that
s
what
i
mean
she
stared
at
me
thoughtfully
why
are
you
asking
this
i
said
i
m
a
busybody
you
are
indeed
it
s
not
your
business
to
ask
a
question
like
that
nor
is
it
mine
to
answer
if
you
must
ask
you
will
have
to
ask
mr
marsogliani
but
i
do
nt
see
why
he
should
answer
you
either
would
you
call
him
she
did
he
answered
at
least
i
suppose
he
answered
since
she
talked
as
though
he
were
on
the
phone
she
explained
that
i
wanted
to
voice
he
only
wishes
to
see
you
for
a
moment
she
had
to
guess
that
for
it
was
not
derived
from
anything
i
had
said
i
got
the
impression
he
would
nt
have
agreed
to
see
me
if
i
had
nt
been
working
through
sarah
chalk
up
one
good
decision
for
me
in
seeing
her
first
and
one
good
turn
from
the
little
woman
thanks
sarah
i
said
i
would
nt
want
to
do
anything
to
make
you
lose
your
job
but
it
requires
restraint
on
my
part
she
smiled
a
little
just
as
i
was
walking
out
the
receptionist
walked
in
she
moved
behind
the
desk
in
the
outer
office
put
down
her
purse
and
looked
at
me
and
then
at
sarah
with
a
kind
of
wise
tolerance
in
her
eyes
she
was
a
good
looking
black
woman
about
thirty
i
should
say
i
lifted
both
hands
as
though
surrendering
business
i
said
strictly
business
she
if
it
werent
anthony
marsogliani
p
m
marsogliani
was
nt
smiling
when
i
reached
his
office
which
was
also
on
the
sixth
floor
he
made
me
wait
while
he
went
over
some
papers
leisurely
making
it
perfectly
clear
he
was
nt
rushing
i
sat
there
my
mind
detached
prepared
to
show
no
signs
of
impatience
but
letting
my
eyes
follow
him
in
all
his
movements
he
was
nt
smoking
a
cigar
but
he
smelled
of
stale
cigar
smoke
just
the
same
i
guess
he
always
did
and
he
looked
about
the
way
he
smelled
sour
and
uninviting
new
information
with
you
made
norton
uneasy
we
have
a
witness
kifner
continued
who
claims
to
have
seen
someone
leaving
the
house
on
volta
place
around
midnight
on
the
night
miss
hendricks
was
murdered
who
is
your
witness
norton
asked
i
m
not
going
to
identify
the
witness
kifner
said
but
i
am
going
to
tell
you
who
he
claims
to
have
seen
leaving
the
house
that
night
okay
who
was
it
you
ben
gabe
was
stretched
out
full
length
on
norton
s
sofa
with
a
tumbler
of
scotch
balanced
on
his
belly
as
he
talked
he
was
alternately
running
his
hand
through
his
dandruff
filled
hair
and
scratching
dead
skin
from
his
mottled
forearms
we
re
getting
close
he
said
fervently
my
rash
is
starting
getting
close
norton
said
glumly
gabe
i
got
close
to
being
blown
to
bits
the
other
morning
it
was
pure
dumb
luck
that
i
was
s
safe
for
me
to
go
out
on
the
street
any
more
nobody
s
gon
na
kill
you
in
washington
gabe
said
flicking
his
stubby
fingers
so
that
scraps
of
dead
skin
fluttered
to
the
floor
it
s
just
out
in
the
field
that
they
pull
stunts
like
that
some
guy
bucking
for
a
promotion
trying
to
impress
the
home
office
just
think
if
you
d
got
blown
up
some
up
and
coming
spook
would
have
made
gs
back
here
in
washington
the
boys
are
more
sophisticated
they
do
nt
plant
bombs
they
plant
ideas
that
s
the
way
to
really
work
a
guy
over
you
re
right
about
that
norton
said
my
old
pal
frank
kifner
planted
some
ideas
with
me
the
other
morning
that
have
just
about
driven
me
up
the
wall
like
what
well
he
might
have
a
perjury
count
against
me
which
i
knew
already
and
then
he
claimed
to
have
a
witness
who
saw
was
killed
gabe
laughed
so
explosively
that
his
drink
spilled
onto
his
pants
leg
he
cursed
and
grabbed
the
glass
managing
in
the
process
to
knock
his
ashtray
onto
the
floor
by
the
time
he
rearranged
himself
his
smile
had
vanished
and
he
stared
at
norton
with
narrowed
eyes
did
you
he
said
sharply
did
i
what
did
you
come
out
of
the
house
that
night
you
dummy
norton
groaned
with
disbelief
no
i
did
nt
come
out
of
the
house
that
night
i
did
nt
kill
her
if
that
s
what
you
re
thinking
the
reporter
shrugged
and
pulled
at
his
wet
pants
leg
stranger
things
have
happened
he
muttered
the
thing
is
norton
continued
that
kifner
would
nt
tell
me
who
his
witness
is
if
there
really
is
one
i
mean
he
could
be
bluffing
he
s
not
bluffing
gabe
said
he
lit
a
lucky
and
he
d
spilled
onto
the
floor
how
do
you
know
he
s
not
bluffing
because
i
know
who
his
witness
is
who
for
christ
s
sake
joey
smallwood
the
crazy
kid
in
the
liquor
store
that
s
him
he
s
a
professional
window
peeper
always
prowling
around
georgetown
at
night
and
they
ve
got
him
claiming
he
was
across
the
street
and
saw
you
coming
out
some
witness
norton
said
bitterly
you
d
think
they
d
do
better
than
that
they
do
nt
have
to
gabe
said
sure
joey
s
too
nutty
for
his
testimony
to
hold
up
in
court
but
they
can
ruin
you
just
with
the
scandal
or
maybe
they
do
bring
a
perjury
charge
and
maybe
they
make
it
stick
you
get
disbarred
maybe
do
a
year
or
two
in
the
slammer
and
by
that
time
nobody
s
gon
na
listen
to
what
you
say
about
you
pal
norton
got
up
and
poured
them
both
another
drink
gabe
stretched
out
on
the
sofa
again
blowing
smoke
rings
toward
the
ceiling
and
scratching
his
arms
his
left
wrist
had
begun
to
bleed
and
he
licked
the
blood
away
occasionally
i
ve
got
a
theory
about
this
case
gabe
said
after
a
while
i
have
nt
got
all
the
details
pinned
down
yet
but
it
s
coming
let
s
hear
it
to
start
with
you
have
to
assume
whitmore
or
murphy
or
somebody
else
in
their
inner
circle
zapped
donna
otherwise
all
this
cover
up
does
nt
make
any
sense
so
what
they
need
is
a
fall
guy
and
it
looks
like
you
ve
been
elected
why
me
why
not
you
it
makes
sense
the
jilted
lover
and
all
that
that
s
what
that
phone
call
to
you
telling
you
donna
was
dead
was
all
about
to
make
you
do
exactly
what
you
did
you
who
do
you
think
called
me
my
guess
would
be
riddle
he
s
up
to
his
ears
in
this
thing
but
and
here
s
where
things
get
complicated
then
joey
comes
along
the
nutty
kid
who
waited
on
her
in
the
liquor
store
and
maybe
followed
her
home
or
something
joey
not
having
a
law
degree
or
even
much
sense
figures
to
be
an
even
better
fall
guy
than
you
so
i
figure
they
change
strategies
in
midstream
frame
joey
then
why
have
they
now
got
joey
saying
i
did
it
because
one
he
s
got
an
all
american
mom
who
swears
he
was
home
that
night
and
two
you
re
such
a
pain
in
the
ass
they
figure
they
ll
shut
you
up
okay
gabe
but
if
they
re
trying
to
frame
me
for
the
murder
why
did
they
try
to
blow
me
up
the
other
day
or
does
nt
your
theory
extend
that
gabe
admitted
somebody
might
have
figured
that
it
d
be
easier
to
frame
you
if
you
were
dead
in
absentia
so
to
speak
gabe
took
a
swallow
of
his
drink
and
then
chewed
at
a
hangnail
for
a
minute
or
he
said
finally
it
could
be
that
there
s
one
bunch
trying
to
frame
you
and
another
bunch
trying
to
kill
you
you
never
want
to
underestimate
the
fuck
up
factor
when
you
re
dealing
with
the
government
they
sat
in
not
a
one
woman
show
not
yet
but
in
new
york
i
had
some
of
my
work
in
a
group
show
what
kind
of
group
show
she
smiled
i
am
almost
afraid
to
tell
you
why
it
was
a
women
s
collective
she
said
you
mean
women
s
lib
feminists
yes
she
glanced
at
him
quickly
taking
in
his
reaction
some
men
if
you
say
that
they
yell
and
scream
it
does
nt
bother
me
he
said
there
s
something
to
it
i
guess
so
you
re
a
feminist
in
a
way
she
thought
for
a
moment
not
truly
they
had
come
no
one
ahead
of
them
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
that
no
one
was
behind
them
either
his
left
arm
remained
curled
easily
around
hers
but
his
right
arm
tensed
his
right
hand
flexed
readying
itself
no
he
told
himself
not
yet
there
would
be
an
opportunity
later
on
maybe
in
another
five
minutes
in
the
meantime
he
might
as
well
learn
more
about
her
while
he
had
the
chance
here
isabella
said
i
am
a
feminist
i
am
thought
of
as
a
wild
woman
she
laughed
it
is
not
hard
to
be
thought
of
as
a
wild
woman
in
italy
to
people
who
think
of
a
woman
as
a
domestic
animal
bed
and
kitchen
and
nothing
elsei
am
a
very
bad
person
i
am
bad
because
i
choose
to
be
free
but
she
went
on
i
am
not
like
some
of
the
women
i
met
in
new
york
for
instance
she
looked
at
him
out
of
not
hate
men
the
path
turned
and
ended
they
came
out
into
a
large
opening
that
surrounded
a
lake
it
was
fairly
crowded
and
even
though
it
was
a
weekday
there
was
a
holiday
spirit
in
the
air
people
lounged
by
the
water
or
walked
along
the
grassy
banks
or
glided
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
in
small
rowboats
professional
boatmen
steered
larger
canopied
boats
with
noisy
children
bouncing
on
them
fat
brown
and
white
ducks
were
mooching
crusts
of
bread
from
the
generous
hearted
isabella
stopped
suddenly
all
it
was
a
little
gasp
of
excitement
i
burattini
what
puppets
she
pointed
see
a
small
crowd
had
gathered
near
a
tall
umbrella
pine
a
miniature
stage
had
been
set
up
by
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
on
it
two
puppets
were
jerking
about
come
on
she
took
his
hand
and
with
childlike
eagerness
dragged
him
after
her
they
one
puppet
a
grotesque
little
fellow
wearing
a
black
mask
a
peaked
white
hat
and
what
seemed
to
be
a
white
nightgown
was
singing
off
key
in
a
loud
squeaky
voice
the
other
one
a
handsome
mustachioed
puppet
in
a
guardsman
s
jacket
was
yelling
at
him
cursing
him
it
seemed
isabella
was
already
laughing
what
s
going
on
lacey
asked
this
one
does
not
like
the
way
that
one
sings
and
he
is
she
broke
off
and
with
a
helpless
wave
of
her
hand
said
it
does
not
translate
white
hat
had
stopped
singing
and
now
the
two
puppets
were
yelling
at
each
other
at
the
same
time
mustache
disappeared
beneath
the
stage
then
popped
up
again
carrying
a
stick
he
beat
white
hat
with
it
white
hat
got
very
agitated
snatched
away
the
stick
and
beat
mustache
in
return
it
did
nt
seem
very
funny
to
lacey
but
he
chuckled
any
way
isabella
took
pleased
that
he
saw
the
humor
of
it
too
he
looked
down
at
her
she
was
no
longer
watching
the
puppets
but
was
gazing
up
at
him
smiling
he
bent
his
head
to
kiss
her
it
was
an
impulse
he
did
nt
pause
to
question
it
but
as
his
lips
were
about
to
make
contact
with
hers
he
stopped
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
figure
that
had
emerged
from
behind
the
trunk
of
the
umbrella
pine
had
stepped
clear
of
the
puppet
stage
and
was
now
standing
facing
them
he
straightened
up
and
looked
rather
casually
not
so
obviously
that
isabella
would
notice
it
was
renato
aziz
s
helper
the
young
man
was
standing
his
hands
on
his
hips
staring
at
them
with
blatant
interest
let
s
go
lacey
said
now
isabella
looked
totally
baffled
i
just
remembered
i
ve
got
some
work
to
do
he
took
her
nt
look
back
at
renato
they
said
very
little
on
the
way
back
through
the
park
or
in
the
taxi
no
cars
were
allowed
in
the
trevi
fountain
neighborhood
so
the
driver
let
them
out
on
the
via
del
tritone
two
blocks
from
the
rinaldis
apartment
they
walked
from
there
down
the
middle
of
the
traffic
free
street
isabella
was
obviously
distressed
she
imagined
she
had
done
something
wrong
and
of
course
she
could
nt
guess
what
it
was
from
time
to
time
she
would
cast
a
nervous
sidelong
glance
at
him
but
lacey
kept
his
eyes
before
him
and
said
nothing
they
turned
into
the
via
delle
muratte
he
went
with
her
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
rinaldis
building
then
he
took
her
hand
and
said
it
s
been
a
beautiful
afternoon
isabella
thank
you
i
enjoyed
it
too
alan
she
hesitated
still
uncompre
bending
then
asked
but
what
happened
what
is
the
matter
he
walked
away
when
he
turned
the
corner
at
the
end
of
the
block
they
were
there
waiting
for
him
renato
and
another
man
a
tall
husky
arab
in
a
black
sweater
and
black
pants
buon
giorno
signor
martin
renato
said
pleasantly
i
hope
you
boys
are
nt
too
tired
from
following
me
around
lacey
said
renato
smiled
and
shrugged
it
is
nice
day
he
knew
a
few
words
of
english
after
all
lacey
walked
with
them
back
to
the
via
del
tritone
they
led
him
to
a
small
gray
fiat
parked
near
the
intersection
renato
gestured
for
him
to
get
in
the
front
lacey
did
so
the
arab
got
in
behind
the
wheel
renato
sat
in
the
back
directly
herself
unable
to
leave
the
house
to
see
anyone
i
look
hideous
you
do
nt
at
all
i
do
and
with
that
she
returns
to
bed
for
the
day
donald
garland
she
tells
me
now
is
the
kindest
man
she
has
ever
known
i
was
taken
to
lunch
at
his
house
mypfirst
week
in
hong
kong
and
we
were
the
best
of
friends
from
then
on
we
just
adored
each
other
the
center
of
the
table
was
strewn
with
orchids
he
d
picked
from
his
garden
in
my
honor
he
said
and
the
patio
where
we
ate
looked
out
over
the
crescent
of
repulse
bay
i
was
eighteen
years
old
he
must
have
been
about
fifty
five
my
god
donald
is
probably
seventy
i
could
never
believe
he
was
over
so
thrilled
with
everything

lived
with
the
most
easygoingand
good
natured
american
boy
chips

have
been

six
or
seven

most
terrible
news

morningtwo
months
ago

an
aneurysm
at
breakfast
just
keeled
over
dead
donald
took
the
body
back
to
wilmington
delaware
and
buried
it
and
then
he
could
nt
leave
he
kept
booking
plane
tickets
and
canceling
now
finally
he
s
on
his
way
home
chips
donald
edgar
brian
colin
i
have
no
response
to
make
no
interrogations
or
cross
examination
nothing
faintly
resembling
sympathy
curiosity
or
interest
or
patience
i
had
long
ago
heard
all
i
could
stand
about
the
doings
of
the
wealthy
hong
kong
circle
of
english
homosexuals
who
had
adored
her
i
exhibit
only
a
churlish
sort
of
surprise
to
find
that
i
am
to
be
a
party
to
this
very
special
reunion
she
shuts
her
eyes
tightly
as
though
to
survive
do
nt
talk
to
me
like
that
do
nt
take
that
terrible
tone
he
was
my
dearest
friend
he
saved
my
life
a
hundred
times
and
why
did
you
risk
it
a
hundred
times
but
the
interrogatory
accusation
and
the
terrible
tone
that
goes
with
it
i
manage
to
squelch
for
by
now
even
i
know
that
i
am
being
diminished
far
more
by
my
anger
at
everything
she
does
and
did
than
by
those
ways
of
hers
i
ought
to
have
learned
to
disregard
or
to
have
accepted
with
a
certain
grace
long
long
ago
only
as
the
evening
wears
on
and
garland
becomes
increasingly
spirited
in
his
reminiscences
do
i
wonder
if
she
has
invited
him
to
the
apartment
so
that
i
might
learn
at
first
hand
just
how
very
far
from
the
apex
she
has
fallen
by
insanely
joining
her
fate
to
this
fogy
s
whether
or
not
that
is
her
intention
it
is
something
like
the
result
in
their
company
i
am
no
easygoing
good
natured
chips
to
the
crack
of
the
whip
and
the
swish
of
the
cane
in
a
vain
attempt
to
force
this
pious
sour
censorious
little
prig
out
of
my
skin
i
try
hard
to
believe
that
helen
is
simply
showing
this
man
who
has
meant
so
much
to
her
and
been
so
kind
to
her
and
who
has
himself
just
suffered
a
terrible
blow
that
all
is
well
in
her
life
that
she
and
her
husband
live
comfortably
and
amicably
and
that
her
protector
has
nt
to
worry
about
her
any
longer
yes
helen
is
only
acting
as
would
any
devoted
daughter
who
wished
to
spare
a
doting
father
some
harsh
truth
in
short
simple
as
the
explanation
for
garland
s
presence
might
have
seemed
to
someone
else
it
is
wholly
beyond
my
grasp
as
though
now
that
living
with
helen
has
ceased
to
make
the
least
bit
of
sense
i
can
not
discover
the
truth
about
anything
at
seventy
delicate
small
boned
garland
still
does
have
a
youthful
sort
of
charm
and
a
way
is
so
fragile
looking
it
seems
it
could
be
cracked
with
the
tap
of
a
spoon
and
his
cheeks
are
the
small
round
glazed
cheeks
of
an
alabaster
cupid
above
the
open
shirt
a
pale
silk
scarf
is
tied
around
his
neck
almost
completely
hiding
from
view
the
throat
whose
creases
are
the
only
sign
of
his
age
in
that
strangely
youthful
face
all
there
is
to
speak
of
sorrow
are
the
eyes
soft
brown
and
awash
with
feeling
even
while
his
crisp
accent
refuses
to
betray
the
faintest
hint
of
grief
poor
derek
was
killed
you
know
helen
did
not
know
she
puts
her
hand
to
her
mouth
but
how
derek
she
says
turning
to
me
was
an
associate
in
donald
s
firm
a
very
silly
man
sometimes
very
muddled
and
so
on
but
such
a
good
heart
really
my
dead
expression
sends
her
quickly
back
to
garland
yes
he
says
he
was
a
very
kind
person
he
could
talk
and
go
on
but
then
you
just
had
to
tell
him
derek
that
s
enough
now
and
he
d
shut
up
well
two
chinese
boys
thought
that
he
had
nt
given
them
enough
money
so
they
kicked
him
down
a
flight
of
stairs
broke
derek
s
neck
how
terrible
how
awful
poor
poor
man
and
what
asks
helen
has
happened
to
all
his
animals
the
birds
are
gone
some
sort
of
virus
wiped
them
out
the
week
after
he
was
killed
the
rest
madge
adopted
madge
adopted
them
and
patricia
looks
after
them
otherwise
those
two
wo
nt
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
again
oh
yes
she
can
be
a
good
bitch
that
madge
when
she
wants
to
be
chips
did
her
house
over
for
her
a
year
ago
she
nearly
drove
the
poor
boy
crazy
with
her
upstairs
bath
helen
tries
yet
again
to
explains
that
madge
and
patricia
who
own
houses
down
along
the
bay
from
donald
were
stars
of
the
british
cinema
in
the
forties
donald
rattles
off
the
names
of
the
movies
they
made
i
nod
and
nod
just
like
an
agreeable
person
but
the
smile
i
make
apstab
at
presenting
him
does
not
begin
to
enough
kings
said
gamaliel
drily
he
took
me
by
the
elbow
but
excuse
me
for
being
a
negligent
host
let
us
go
to
the
study
where
we
can
sip
of
persian
wine
and
sit
privately
and
talk
he
led
me
from
the
flowered
atrium
to
a
small
room
with
windows
overlooking
the
splendid
palace
of
caiaphas
and
the
palace
of
herod
you
have
fine
neighbors
i
said
he
smiled
your
father
s
house
is
but
a
short
distance
he
coughed
which
reminds
me
that
your
mother
is
back
i
think
you
should
call
on
her
i
looked
up
eagerly
did
she
ask
after
me
no
but
her
coming
back
suggests
that
she
would
mend
the
wounds
you
but
she
is
my
mother
my
sense
of
grievance
asserted
itself
he
smiled
even
so
does
not
your
master
preach
that
to
forgive
is
to
be
forgiven
i
looked
at
him
closely
you
have
been
following
him
his
head
inclined
slowly
since
he
was
twelve
it
would
appear
but
go
to
your
mother
promise
me
that
i
promised
we
reclined
comfortably
facing
each
other
over
a
table
laden
with
wines
from
many
countries
i
would
prefer
a
judean
wine
i
said
always
the
patriot
judah
well
that
is
one
request
i
can
readily
fulfill
he
looked
up
slowly
the
decanter
poised
over
my
cup
is
there
any
other
request
why
i
asked
does
the
sanhedrin
concern
itself
with
so
slight
a
matter
as
a
healing
at
a
healing
pool
he
frowned
it
is
not
slight
when
you
consider
how
sacred
the
pharisees
hold
the
sabbath
it
was
like
restoring
a
life
according
to
the
law
he
had
no
right
on
the
holy
sabbath
even
to
pick
a
plum
from
a
tree
but
it
was
god
s
work
the
temple
decides
what
is
god
s
work
and
his
eyes
twinkled
the
sanhedrin
decides
the
temple
s
work
annas
family
runs
the
temple
and
the
sanhedrin
i
had
spoken
too
quickly
and
his
red
face
reminded
me
soon
enough
of
his
position
he
went
on
quickly
before
i
could
apologize
the
sanhedrin
is
evenly
divided
between
the
sadducees
and
the
pharisees
and
they
are
not
quick
to
do
annas
bidding
in
all
things
they
have
convened
at
his
request
to
question
the
blind
man
and
his
parents
he
held
out
a
long
finger
but
they
have
not
called
your
jesus
my
curiosity
was
piqued
and
why
is
that
because
he
has
friends
even
in
the
sanhedrin
of
david
and
would
know
more
about
him
before
they
pass
judgment
my
eyes
studied
that
shrewd
jovial
face
not
for
naught
did
they
call
him
the
owl
and
they
fear
the
thousands
that
follow
him
like
the
messiah
i
finished
his
thought
who
would
if
he
gave
the
word
take
over
the
temple
and
the
fortress
antonia
he
chuckled
in
his
beard
he
will
never
give
the
word
for
he
thinks
too
much
of
israel
i
looked
at
him
questioningly
from
all
i
hear
he
is
a
very
wise
man
and
wise
men
know
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
everything
there
was
no
point
in
discussing
roman
arms
and
roman
might
may
any
but
the
blind
attend
this
hearing
of
josiah
bartimaeus
i
asked
he
did
not
laugh
with
your
credentials
that
should
not
be
difficult
my
credentials
are
my
secret
true
so
observe
as
gamaliel
s
guest
as
one
good
then
jesus
will
not
be
summoned
not
if
the
healing
is
deemed
valid
for
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
make
an
issue
of
the
sabbath
at
this
time
against
a
popular
hero
he
must
be
discredited
first
and
that
has
not
happened
i
was
chilled
by
his
cold
logic
so
calculating
it
seemed
evil
i
am
just
looking
at
the
situation
through
annas
eyes
judah
to
achieve
success
one
must
concern
himself
not
so
much
with
what
people
say
or
do
but
with
what
they
want
now
ask
yourself
what
the
old
high
priest
wants
to
stay
in
power
everybody
knows
that
exactly
so
ask
yourself
what
would
undermine
this
power
a
rival
power
precisely
and
what
else
trouble
with
the
romans
he
gave
me
an
embrace
you
are
indeed
your
father
s
son
judah
i
had
only
mentioned
the
obvious
but
it
is
the
approach
to
your
master
i
am
sure
it
would
be
illuminating
but
of
course
you
are
too
close
to
him
to
be
dispassionate
and
too
influenced
by
wishful
thinking
he
waved
aside
my
objections
i
shall
see
you
in
the
morning
remember
he
cautioned
you
are
but
an
observer
as
i
left
i
realized
that
i
had
not
touched
my
wine
the
court
of
the
hewn
stone
where
the
sanhedrin
met
was
nearly
filled
only
a
quorum
of
twenty
three
was
necessary
in
lesser
trials
whereas
in
capital
cases
a
majority
of
the
seventy
was
usually
required
sessions
were
customarily
held
on
two
successive
days
to
assure
the
accused
the
fullest
opportunity
to
reverse
the
outcome
of
the
first
hearing
as
always
the
law
was
more
merciful
than
man
i
saw
many
familiar
faces
in
the
chamber
annas
sat
on
a
raised
platform
facing
the
tribunal
and
slightly
below
sat
the
nasi
the
reb
gamaliel
i
took
a
seat
in
a
back
row
of
the
by
the
nasi
near
the
prisoner
s
dock
i
noticed
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
quietly
waiting
for
the
proceedings
to
begin
the
charges
were
brought
by
the
rabbi
ezra
but
as
the
accuser
he
could
not
be
a
witness
caiaphas
the
prosecutor
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
two
witnesses
were
necessary
and
since
the
accused
was
hardly
a
bona
fide
witness
against
himself
i
wondered
who
the
others
might
be
with
a
start
i
recognized
the
disciple
cestus
who
i
remembered
now
had
been
in
the
company
t
hat
day
he
was
my
responsibility
since
i
had
named
him
and
dysmas
and
joshua
bar
abbas
as
well
after
they
had
shown
some
interest
in
using
this
cloak
to
cover
the
sound
of
another
door
opening
and
shutting
and
then
a
low
mumble
of
voices
the
familiar
sound
of
one
of
those
voices
caused
a
sinister
expression
to
cross
his
dark
face
without
hesitation
he
glided
down
the
passage
and
crouched
like
a
stalking
panther
beside
the
door
it
was
not
locked
and
manipulating
it
delicately
he
pushed
it
open
a
crack
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
possible
consequences
that
only
he
could
have
explained
or
defended
it
was
masked
on
the
other
side
by
tapestries
but
through
a
thin
slit
in
the
velvet
he
looked
into
a
chamber
lit
by
a
candle
on
an
ebony
table
there
were
two
men
in
that
chamber
one
was
a
scarred
sinister
looking
ruffian
in
leather
breeks
and
ragged
cloak
the
other
was
tarascus
king
of
nemedia
tarascus
seemed
ill
at
ease
he
was
slightly
pale
and
he
kept
starting
and
glancing
about
him
as
if
expecting
and
fearing
to
hear
some
he
was
saying
he
is
deep
in
drugged
slumber
but
i
know
not
when
he
may
awaken
strange
to
hear
words
of
fear
issuing
from
the
lips
of
tarascus
rumbled
the
other
in
a
harsh
deep
voice
the
king
frowned
i
fear
no
common
man
as
you
well
know
but
when
i
saw
the
cliffs
fall
at
valkia
i
knew
that
this
devil
we
had
resurrected
was
no
charlatan
i
fear
his
powers
because
i
do
not
know
the
full
extent
of
them
but
i
know
that
somehow
they
are
connected
with
this
accursed
thing
which
i
have
stolen
from
him
it
brought
him
back
to
life
so
it
must
be
the
source
of
his
sorcery
he
had
it
hidden
well
but
following
my
secret
order
a
slave
spied
on
him
and
saw
him
place
it
in
a
golden
chest
and
saw
where
he
hid
the
chest
even
so
i
would
not
have
dared
steal
it
had
xaltotun
himself
not
been
sunk
in
lotus
his
power
with
it
orastes
brought
him
back
to
life
with
it
he
will
make
us
all
slaves
if
we
are
not
wary
so
take
it
and
cast
it
into
the
sea
as
i
have
bidden
you
and
be
sure
you
are
so
far
from
land
that
neither
tide
nor
storm
can
wash
it
up
on
the
beach
you
have
been
paid
so
i
have
grunted
the
ruffian
and
i
owe
more
than
gold
to
you
king
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
even
thieves
can
be
grateful
whatever
debt
you
may
feel
you
owe
me
answered
tarascus
will
be
paid
when
you
have
hurled
this
thing
into
the
sea
i
ll
ride
for
zingara
and
take
ship
from
kordava
promised
the
other
i
dare
not
show
my
head
in
argos
because
of
the
matter
of
a
murder
or
so
i
care
not
so
it
is
done
here
it
is
a
horse
awaits
something
passed
between
them
something
that
flamed
like
livingfire
conan
had
only
a
brief
glimpse
of
it
and
then
the
ruffian
pulled
a
slouch
hat
over
his
eyes
drew
his
cloak
about
his
shoulder
and
hurried
from
the
chamber
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
conan
moved
with
the
devastating
fury
of
unchained
blood
lust
he
had
held
himself
in
check
as
long
as
he
could
the
sight
of
his
enemy
so
near
him
set
his
wild
blood
seething
and
swept
away
all
caution
and
restraint
tarascus
was
turning
toward
an
inner
door
when
conan
tore
aside
the
hangings
and
leaped
like
a
blood
mad
panther
into
the
room
tarascus
wheeled
but
even
before
he
could
recognize
his
attacker
conan
s
poniard
ripped
into
him
but
the
blow
was
not
mortal
as
conan
knew
the
instant
he
struck
his
foot
had
caught
in
a
fold
of
the
curtains
and
tripped
him
as
he
leaped
the
point
fleshed
itself
in
tarascus
s
shoulder
and
plowed
down
along
his
ribs
and
the
king
of
nemedia
screamed
body
hurled
him
back
against
the
table
and
it
toppled
and
the
candle
went
out
they
were
both
carried
to
the
floor
by
the
violence
of
conan
s
rush
and
the
foot
of
the
tapestry
hampered
them
both
in
its
folds
conan
was
stabbing
blindly
in
the
dark
tarascus
screaming
in
a
frenzy
of
panicky
terror
as
if
fear
lent
him
superhuman
energy
tarascus
tore
free
and
blundered
away
in
the
darkness
shrieking
help
guards
arideus
orastes
orastes
conan
rose
kicking
himself
free
of
the
tangling
tapestries
and
the
broken
table
cursing
with
the
bitterness
of
his
blood
thirsty
disappointment
he
was
confused
and
ignorant
of
the
plan
of
the
palace
the
yells
of
tarascus
were
still
resounding
in
the
distance
and
a
wild
outcry
was
bursting
forth
in
answer
the
nemedian
had
escaped
him
in
the
darkness
and
conan
did
not
know
which
way
he
had
gone
the
cimmerian
s
rash
stroke
for
vengeance
had
failed
and
there
remained
only
the
task
of
saving
his
own
back
down
the
passage
and
into
the
alcove
glaring
out
into
the
lighted
corridor
just
as
zenobia
came
running
up
it
her
dark
eyes
dilated
with
terror
oh
what
has
happened
she
cried
the
palace
is
roused
i
swear
i
have
not
betrayed
you
no
it
was
i
who
stirred
up
the
hornet
s
nest
he
grunted
i
tried
to
pay
off
a
score
what
s
the
shortest
way
out
of
this
she
caught
his
wrist
and
ran
fleetly
down
the
corridor
but
before
they
reached
the
heavy
door
at
the
other
end
muffled
shouts
arose
from
behind
it
and
the
portals
began
to
shake
under
an
assault
from
the
other
side
zenobia
wrung
her
hands
and
whimpered
we
are
cut
off
i
locked
that
door
as
i
returned
through
it
but
they
will
burst
it
in
in
a
moment
the
way
to
the
postern
gate
lies
through
it
conan
wheeled
up
the
corridor
though
still
out
of
sight
foes
were
behind
as
well
as
before
him
quick
into
this
door
the
girl
cried
desperately
running
across
the
corridor
and
throwing
bless
you
we
talked
movie
business
for
a
time
he
sat
listening
staring
down
at
his
glas
swilling
the
ice
cubes
round
unnaturally
deferential
as
if
he
would
rather
be
chatting
up
the
stewardess
then
he
began
to
talk
again
about
television
its
ephemerality
the
stupefying
quantity
of
horse
shit
his
own
programmes
involved
it
was
a
trauma
or
ordeal
i
had
long
been
through
myself
the
tyranny
of
the
mass
audience
the
need
to
suppress
instinct
education
subtlety
and
a
dozen
other
things
in
favour
of
the
bedrock
truth
of
the
human
condition
tha
the
majority
is
ignorant
and
wants
or
at
least
pays
money
to
be
treated
as
a
moron
audiences
are
shmucks
as
a
celebrated
oh
hollywood
director
once
put
it
succinctly
to
me
and
shmucks
hat
brains
then
barney
went
on
about
the
horrors
of
now
bein
recognized
everywhere
he
went
but
no
one
walks
into
that
blind
all
art
from
the
finest
poetry
to
the
sleaziest
strip
show
has
the
same
clause
written
in
you
will
henceforth
entails
still
i
felt
some
sympathy
fon
him
and
a
certain
wry
amusement
at
finding
myself
in
jenny
s
role
now
perhaps
he
sensed
it
we
had
a
couple
more
whiskies
and
lx
raised
his
glass
well
here
s
to
caroline
anyway
he
drank
then
said
she
seems
to
have
survived
the
divorce
pretty
well
by
some
miracle
it
s
been
nice
getting
to
know
her
this
last
couple
of
years
you
probably
did
nt
miss
much
speaking
from
bitter
personal
experience
ii
ve
forgotten
three
boys
the
oldest
wo
nt
speak
to
me
the
middle
one
ca
nt
and
the
youngest
does
he
s
the
one
i
hate
i
ie
d
said
that
before
no
doubt
in
el
vino
s
and
beyond
the
epigram
margaret
s
problem
really
i
ve
opted
out
i
felt
pretty
much
the
me
about
my
own
old
man
they
do
nt
bother
to
hide
s
progress
i
tried
to
remember
margaret
a
small
woman
with
a
smile
that
i
led
too
hard
and
who
said
nothing
unless
spoken
to
never
seemed
quite
to
want
to
be
where
she
was
she
had
nt
been
at
oxford
and
i
knew
very
little
about
her
barney
stared
again
down
the
cabin
roll
on
the
republic
let
some
other
poor
bastard
bring
the
little
horrors
up
i
m
sorry
my
fault
never
enough
time
or
the
patience
he
took
a
breath
and
another
mouthful
of
whisky
then
changed
the
subject
you
re
coming
back
here
as
soon
as
no
i
ll
finish
the
script
at
home
he
gave
me
one
of
his
old
smiles
knowing
and
searching
is
it
really
home
for
you
now
england
good
lord
yes
i
ve
got
a
small
farm
down
in
devon
caroline
told
me
sounds
nice
we
drifted
then
to
the
i
shared
doubts
and
disillusions
grasped
for
apples
turned
to
wax
dreams
become
ashes
but
i
would
never
have
come
out
with
that
to
him
you
can
practise
self
deprecation
and
get
away
with
it
with
those
you
love
but
not
with
those
you
despise
i
decided
he
was
anxious
that
i
should
nt
say
too
much
about
the
past
to
caro
he
too
wanted
a
favourable
report
he
had
problems
he
did
nt
take
himself
too
seriously
they
started
bringing
round
the
meal
and
i
used
that
my
not
having
slept
and
not
feeling
hungry
to
break
off
the
conversation
ile
was
very
anxious
we
should
have
lunch
one
day
soon
if
i
was
in
london
i
made
the
right
noises
then
i
lay
down
sleep
came
deep
and
dreamless
like
all
slumbers
of
the
damned
tarquinia
they
had
one
golden
period
anthony
heard
of
an
empty
flat
in
rome
and
the
four
of
them
spent
six
weeks
in
it
during
the
high
summer
of
the
year
that
followed
their
last
as
the
academic
sense
anthony
was
now
teaching
at
worcester
and
dan
was
stage
managing
at
the
playhouse
on
a
pittance
and
really
living
on
the
eight
hundred
a
year
he
had
inherited
anthony
and
jane
had
married
in
december
she
was
four
months
pregnant
by
the
time
they
went
to
rome
their
wedding
had
been
formal
and
formidable
with
a
full
panoply
of
relatives
dan
was
best
man
jane
had
been
officially
received
into
the
church
a
month
previously
in
the
new
year
they
moved
into
a
cottage
at
wytham
dan
and
nell
had
had
a
much
simpler
registry
office
ceremony
as
soon
as
nell
had
taken
her
finals
and
rome
was
their
token
honeymoon
a
year
before
dan
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
he
could
go
through
with
such
an
arrangement
but
much
had
changed
in
the
interval
he
would
have
liked
not
to
see
jane
for
weeks
after
their
acte
gratuit
but
that
very
next
afternoon
he
was
working
in
his
room
when
she
appeared
with
anthony
it
happened
so
fast
no
time
to
dread
the
meeting
their
names
as
the
discoverers
of
the
corpse
whose
murderer
was
never
found
were
already
in
the
morning
newspapers
anthony
seemed
wrily
amused
wanted
to
hear
dan
s
side
of
it
he
had
to
be
treated
normally
as
nell
already
that
day
had
had
to
be
treated
normally
she
knew
he
was
cramming
and
had
arrived
just
after
breakfast
on
her
bicycle
on
her
way
to
her
first
lecture
she
had
been
easy
to
deceive
she
showed
no
suspicion
merely
a
shocked
excitement
so
ghastly
so
extraordinary
their
idyllic
little
cut
he
found
he
could
look
at
jane
without
embarrassment
he
even
felt
a
belated
pity
for
anthony
and
discovered
how
easy
it
was
to
pull
wool
over
trusting
eyes
and
began
to
condone
himself
it
had
been
a
comedy
a
ten
minutes
madness
he
felt
himself
running
away
already
devaluing
the
reality
even
comparing
jane
physically
to
nell
telling
himself
he
really
preferred
nell
he
was
nt
to
go
to
the
bathroom
and
they
were
left
alone
it
was
a
warm
day
she
was
i
m
already
married
he
snapped
his
fingers
it
completely
slipped
my
mind
she
put
her
knife
and
fork
down
and
playfully
lunged
at
him
pushing
his
shoulders
to
the
grass
and
pinning
them
there
michelle
smiled
i
do
nt
know
i
have
nt
thought
that
far
ahead
well
i
have
he
kissed
her
tasting
the
pella
on
her
breath
and
reached
for
the
zipper
at
the
back
of
her
blouse
let
me
help
she
said
he
nodded
and
she
rolled
to
the
side
they
undressed
in
silence
the
light
from
the
fire
creating
shadows
that
danced
among
the
trees
the
night
air
felt
warm
against
their
naked
bodies
hans
lay
on
his
back
with
her
head
on
his
chest
but
for
some
reason
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
shattered
specks
of
light
pierced
the
heavens
he
stared
into
the
sky
made
out
the
constellation
orion
and
tried
to
distinguish
the
colors
of
its
four
perimeter
stars
failing
he
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
to
the
interminable
silence
of
the
dark
hunter
who
seemed
somehow
to
be
trying
to
tell
him
something
what
s
the
matter
michelle
asked
nothing
are
you
shoulder
and
silently
ran
her
nails
along
his
spine
she
really
did
nt
care
if
he
told
her
what
was
on
his
mind
or
not
her
assignment
was
not
to
understand
him
not
to
extract
information
from
him
but
to
keep
him
occupied
away
from
his
apartment
in
the
heart
of
cyprus
away
from
his
radio
transmitter
away
from
the
message
he
should
have
been
receiving
pressure
built
in
hans
s
ears
and
he
felt
the
landing
gear
lock
into
position
preparing
for
arrival
he
took
the
white
plastic
coffee
cup
off
the
tray
in
front
of
him
and
handed
it
to
a
passing
stewardess
how
soon
are
we
due
in
frankfurt
he
asked
her
we
ll
be
landing
at
rein
main
field
in
seven
minutes
he
thought
about
the
ever
punctilious
germans
it
would
not
do
for
a
lufthansa
stewardess
to
say
five
minutes
or
ten
minutes
when
the
precise
figure
was
seven
three
weeks
had
passed
since
hans
was
ordered
to
liquidate
his
if
he
was
to
be
reassigned
immediately
he
supposed
he
was
agents
simply
were
not
presented
with
vacations
or
sabbatical
leaves
not
that
he
minded
he
could
nt
think
of
anything
he
would
want
to
do
with
time
off
there
was
a
ping
above
his
head
he
fastened
his
seatbelt
and
sank
deeper
into
the
cushion
he
lacked
any
feeling
of
well
being
now
that
the
cyprus
operation
was
over
he
thought
only
of
the
next
mission
karl
richtman
met
hans
at
the
terminal
quickly
ush
ered
him
into
a
small
beige
mercedes
c
then
sped
out
of
the
airport
accelerating
rapidly
onto
the
autobahn
hans
knew
the
route
well
it
was
a
short
six
miles
along
the
main
river
to
the
city
where
are
you
taking
me
hans
asked
as
they
raced
through
the
wooded
german
countryside
nowhere
i
m
just
going
to
drive
long
enough
to
make
sure
you
were
nt
followed
then
i
ll
head
back
to
the
airport
you
have
a
flight
hesitated
before
asking
the
next
question
where
am
i
going
richtman
looked
sideways
at
him
you
re
going
home
hans
s
face
bore
no
expression
of
the
emotion
he
felt
for
how
long
i
have
nt
been
told
he
paused
for
a
moment
would
you
like
it
to
be
permanent
hans
looked
out
at
the
tree
lined
highway
tall
cypresses
bent
and
straightened
in
the
breeze
i
do
nt
know
i
have
nt
given
the
idea
much
thought
there
is
a
limit
to
how
long
one
can
stay
out
there
i
ve
been
in
germany
for
two
years
and
i
can
hardly
wait
to
get
home
you
must
he
tired
not
too
tired
hans
snapped
i
did
nt
mean
that
richtman
said
apologetically
hans
sensed
that
he
did
we
just
heard
there
was
some
trouble
on
cyprus
is
anyone
following
us
richtman
looked
into
the
rear
view
mirror
the
all
clear
signal
good
richtman
swung
the
mercedes
off
the
autobahn
and
proceeded
to
the
airport
via
a
secondary
highway
a
strained
silence
separated
the
two
men
as
the
car
darted
through
the
traffic
finally
hans
turned
and
placed
his
hand
on
karl
s
shoulder
i
m
sorry
if
i
was
short
with
you
but
you
hit
me
with
quite
a
surprise
it
s
been
awhile
since
i
was
home
richtman
smiled
i
understand
it
must
be
a
long
time
since
you
ve
seen
your
wife
three
years
and
then
it
was
only
for
a
month
it
s
rough
you
know
i
missed
my
son
s
graduation
from
the
university
richtman
paused
for
a
moment
maybe
men
like
us
have
no
right
to
marry
hans
did
nt
respond
as
they
parked
in
front
of
the
departure
terminal
richtman
reached
into
his
coat
pocket
give
me
your
hans
hoffmann
papers
and
i
ll
give
you
your
own
passport
richtman
extended
across
the
seat
holding
it
in
his
hand
he
fingered
the
gold
embossed
letters
on
the
vinyl
cover
you
have
nt
forgotten
who
you
are
richtman
said
jokingly
no
major
ari
ben
sion
of
the
mossad
haelion
lemodiin
ubitachon
his
country
s
supreme
intelligence
agency
slipped
his
israeli
passport
into
his
coat
pocket
and
headed
for
the
el
al
departure
lounge
as
the
boeing
inched
its
way
over
the
aegean
sea
ari
took
a
final
sip
of
his
j
b
then
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes
there
was
so
much
to
think
about
so
many
loose
ends
to
tie
up
in
israel
but
he
preferred
not
to
deal
with
any
of
that
before
he
landed
he
would
sort
out
his
life
later
now
he
would
sleep
he
was
jarred
awake
as
the
tires
locked
into
position
below
the
wings
banged
down
on
the
concrete
runway
the
plane
surged
forward
in
the
air
bounced
and
began
to
slow
with
out
the
window
ari
saw
that
the
lettering
over
the
terminal
read
could
live
in
his
place
and
make
good
a
few
clay
promises
after
all
i
feel
almost
religious
about
going
back
up
there
and
seeing
what
i
can
make
of
it
ah
in
that
be
it
from
me
to
tamper
with
any
more
creative
spirits
much
less
a
religious
impulse
no
violet
i
m
not
making
fun
of
you
i
really
hope
you
make
it
for
several
years
after
ambrose
left
and
you
and
i
had
that
polite
luncheon
at
schrafft
s
i
would
check
the
gallery
ads
every
sunday
in
the
times
every
week
i
d
steel
myself
for
the
sight
of
your
name
in
one
of
those
little
squares
i
had
mixed
feelings
i
wanted
you
to
make
it
but
i
was
bitter
because
i
would
no
longer
have
a
share
in
your
happiness
i
had
hoped
the
three
of
us
would
be
a
sort
of
family
well
let
me
tell
you
something
if
and
when
the
day
comes
that
i
do
see
your
name
my
feelings
wo
nt
be
mixed
anymore
both
of
us
buried
something
up
there
today
i
buried
my
resentment
there
was
a
lot
of
it
but
she
put
her
hand
on
mine
i
really
think
her
touched
by
her
candor
i
was
half
tempted
to
say
i
had
changed
my
mind
about
the
lobster
salad
and
wine
but
just
then
we
entered
the
lincoln
tunnel
and
as
the
tiled
walls
yellowish
in
the
underground
light
sped
monotonously
past
i
felt
the
old
inertia
lurking
even
now
in
the
edges
of
my
resolve
i
did
nt
trust
myself
in
carol
s
territory
with
a
full
stomachunquickening
my
blood
and
a
good
wine
displacing
gravity
with
effervescence
in
my
head
i
would
sit
there
in
her
well
appointedspace
the
relics
of
her
family
s
solidity
and
what
her
own
industry
had
added
grouped
round
us
like
testimonials
and
i
might
begin
to
doubt
the
solidity
of
that
little
cabin
shimmering
as
i
had
first
seen
it
in
its
equal
mixture
of
sun
and
shadow
it
represented
my
vision
of
what
might
still
be
done
but
it
waspa
frail
and
fledgling
vision
balanced
precariously
between
the
practical
and
the
ideal
the
least
tipping
of
my
attitude
toward
skepticism
or
sloth
could
render
it
into
her
gucci
bag
here
s
my
card
so
you
wo
nt
have
the
excuse
of
not
knowing
where
to
reach
me
i
d
like
it
so
much
if
you
d
just
call
every
now
and
then
i
ll
write
i
wo
nt
have
a
phone
up
there
you
really
are
going
are
nt
you
well
i
wish
you
luck
will
you
keep
in
touch
i
have
a
genuine
curiosity
about
what
will
happen
to
you
i
ll
write
then
promise
i
promise
she
leaned
over
and
laid
her
cool
cheek
against
mine
she
still
wore
such
nice
perfume
oh
and
do
nt
forget
your
times
arriving
in
plommet
falls
this
morning
she
had
presentedit
to
me
folded
open
to
ambrose
s
obituary
as
modestly
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
gift
it
s
placed
well
people
can
see
it
she
said
now
studying
it
possessively
of
course
day
even
when
compressed
into
two
paragraphs
he
manages
to
come
out
looking
glamorous
does
nt
he
between
friendsit
was
late
friday
afternoon
exactly
one
week
since
ambrose
s
suicide
had
put
the
finishing
touch
on
my
day
of
lost
options
as
i
d
come
to
think
of
it
i
was
sitting
in
milo
s
garden
sketch
ing
his
brilliant
array
of
late
summer
flowers
with
my
new
set
of
marvy
markers
their
forty
eight
colors
listed
on
the
inside
of
the
box
in
four
languages
i
had
gone
a
bit
wild
at
the
art
supplyshop
the
day
before
following
my
success
at
having
sublet
my
apartment
to
three
members
of
a
mime
troupe
i
do
nt
much
like
the
idea
of
three
grumbled
the
landlord
oh
but
they
ll
be
as
quiet
as
one
i
d
assured
him
that
s
their
profession
three
young
hopefuls
full
of
enthusiasm
for
everything
to
do
with
new
york
they
had
padded
on
tensed
dancers
legs
from
a
girl
with
thick
flowing
hair
to
her
waist
and
two
boys
a
couple
and
their
friend
the
couple
bought
the
double
bed
jake
and
i
had
occupied
i
hoped
our
old
animosities
would
not
haunt
them
the
boy
would
make
his
bedroom
in
my
old
studio
to
him
i
sold
a
table
a
chair
and
the
studio
couch
from
the
living
room
they
bought
the
dishes
and
rugs
as
well
they
wrote
me
out
checks
still
drawn
on
a
bank
in
urbana
illinois
we
ll
take
any
work
we
can
get
till
we
get
established
they
explained
the
girl
was
excited
because
she
was
pretty
sure
she
had
got
a
job
doing
a
shampoo
commercial
i
had
mailed
myselfthree
boxes
of
art
supplies
care
of
minerva
means
and
managed
to
compress
nine
years
worth
of
accumulations
into
two
portable
bulks
my
stereo
and
record
collection
as
well
as
a
dozen
or
so
paintings
not
bad
enough
to
throw
away
but
not
good
enough
to
live
in
a
one
room
cabin
with
with
me
on
the
morning
bus
to
plommet
falls
milo
was
watering
his
flowers
his
form
hovered
so
gracefully
over
a
cluster
of
brilliant
dahlias
that
i
had
half
a
mind
to
include
him
in
the
composition
in
the
late
afternoon
light
he
looked
like
some
serene
gold
dappled
ascetic
in
a
pisanello
but
if
i
remained
true
to
the
hard
hot
hued
flowers
i
would
render
him
pale
and
insubstantial
on
the
other
hand
if
i
set
my
mind
to
capturing
his
ethereal
grace
the
flowers
would
appear
gaudy
in
contrast
no
milo
was
more
of
a
watercolor
than
a
marvy
marker
composition
and
having
decided
i
put
a
rich
splotch
of
magenta
right
where
the
loose
flowing
line
of
his
creamy
shirted
rib
cage
would
otherwise
have
gone
ha
i
said
consulting
the
multilingual
color
chart
the
broad
shore
s
back
the
rocks
like
the
knobs
of
its
spine
it
was
turning
into
one
of
those
days
on
which
the
sun
not
hot
showed
itself
through
clenched
openings
in
the
clouds
winter
was
over
madeline
led
the
way
up
the
ledge
to
a
gaunt
outcropping
of
earth
she
climbed
it
and
then
faced
back
briefly
to
wave
at
brady
he
was
having
trouble
making
the
climb
his
shoes
kept
slipping
on
the
stone
by
the
time
he
achieved
the
pinnacle
she
was
gone
a
path
led
into
a
thicket
of
brambles
and
the
low
scrub
pine
that
thrives
in
the
sandy
soil
by
the
ocean
in
new
england
he
followed
it
the
fog
had
entirely
lifted
and
the
last
mist
was
burned
away
there
were
little
globules
of
moisture
on
the
branches
and
small
leaves
of
the
undergrowth
but
one
could
almost
see
them
evaporating
had
to
have
gone
this
way
he
thought
and
so
continued
along
the
path
it
wound
past
a
high
chicken
wire
fence
that
was
nearly
grown
over
brady
stopped
to
examine
it
and
discerned
in
the
brambles
and
shrubs
the
ruins
of
a
tennis
court
i
used
to
play
here
he
heard
her
voice
before
he
saw
her
she
was
standing
inside
the
viny
fence
in
the
middle
of
the
overgrown
court
the
baseline
would
have
been
here
she
toed
the
dirt
and
the
net
she
looked
wistfully
around
whose
place
is
it
phillipses
the
sanford
phillipses
friends
of
my
parents
i
d
forgottentheir
place
was
here
it
seems
ancient
like
the
ruins
of
pompeii
but
a
tennis
court
can
return
to
the
wild
in
a
matter
of
years
it
is
ancient
that
was
years
ago
i
feel
very
old
suddenly
she
made
her
way
toward
him
drew
very
close
mortality
of
playgrounds
colman
said
absently
colman
i
need
some
reassurance
they
stared
at
each
other
through
the
fence
not
moving
then
as
if
on
cue
they
began
going
along
the
opposite
sides
of
the
fence
gaining
momentum
as
they
went
slapping
brush
and
branches
out
of
the
way
soon
they
were
practically
running
side
by
side
the
wire
between
them
they
embraced
in
the
gate
madeline
was
weeping
as
brady
looked
over
her
shoulder
onto
the
old
tennis
court
he
suddenlysaw
the
scene
as
it
had
been
twenty
five
years
before
young
people
beautiful
tan
perfect
in
their
whites
the
two
boys
in
flannel
trousers
the
two
girls
in
pleats
they
were
playing
a
vigorous
match
madeline
gardner
was
serving
thwapp
her
racquet
drove
the
ball
deep
into
the
service
box
forcing
the
young
man
to
skip
backward
and
flick
weakly
at
the
ball
which
arched
back
across
the
net
graceful
lunge
she
smashed
it
back
at
him
he
never
had
a
chance
game
one
hollered
set
great
madeline
approached
the
net
she
kissed
her
opponent
on
the
mouth
her
lips
were
wet
let
s
go
get
loaded
her
partner
threw
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
as
they
headed
off
the
court
toweling
themselves
madeline
let
her
right
hand
rest
casually
on
his
buttocks
her
thumb
hooked
in
his
trousers
pocket
brady
felt
her
hand
on
his
own
buttocks
she
was
pressing
kneading
exciting
him
immeasurably
i
know
a
place
she
said
brady
nodded
and
let
her
take
him
by
the
hand
they
walked
in
silence
along
an
overgrown
path
there
madeline
thomson
said
pointing
to
a
great
stone
mansion
on
a
spit
of
land
the
ocean
crashed
around
it
on
two
sides
the
phillips
house
just
for
us
the
mansion
struck
no
roots
in
the
sand
great
rock
ledges
that
guarded
against
the
breakers
a
precarious
place
colman
thought
all
too
exposed
perhaps
there
s
someone
there
he
cautioned
no
not
yet
she
set
out
across
the
high
grass
still
pulling
him
it
was
the
simplicity
of
her
stride
he
envied
she
had
no
thought
that
she
trespassed
he
watched
the
windows
on
the
second
and
third
floors
expecting
curtains
to
be
parted
but
there
was
no
movement
the
windows
on
the
first
floor
were
covered
with
cracked
rectangles
of
wood
the
color
of
seaweed
the
building
itself
was
a
compound
of
stones
and
beams
they
entered
a
modest
courtyard
formed
on
one
side
by
a
row
of
garages
on
another
by
a
detached
cottage
and
on
the
third
by
the
house
itself
brady
s
initial
impression
of
the
fragility
of
the
place
held
despite
its
massive
stateliness
little
mortar
was
discernible
between
the
large
random
shaped
rocks
and
the
mansion
seemed
to
be
an
achievement
more
of
balance
than
construction
nodding
at
the
cottage
but
otherwise
ignoring
it
she
fixed
her
attention
on
the
main
entrance
which
she
approached
confidently
she
tried
to
open
it
damn
locked
of
course
it
s
locked
should
the
proprietor
have
left
the
place
open
all
winter
for
the
sake
of
their
early
spring
tryst
my
parents
never
locked
their
house
at
vineyard
haven
times
were
different
then
dearie
and
vineyard
haven
is
nt
gloucester
madeline
slammed
her
fist
against
the
door
which
solid
oak
barely
registered
the
blow
oh
damn
she
turned
and
slumped
against
the
lintel
and
looked
at
brady
she
seemed
a
petulant
defied
child
her
mouth
fixed
in
a
showy
pout
brady
leaned
both
his
hands
on
the
wood
by
her
ears
you
give
the
appearance
of
being
a
very
competent
person
she
gave
him
a
look
of
such
unfettered
trust
that
he
felt
a
pang
as
if
he
were
misreading
it
or
unworthy
said
i
m
not
he
kissed
her
brushing
her
teeth
with
his
tongue
let
s
see
what
we
can
do
he
said
he
took
her
hand
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
courtyard
he
approached
the
servants
cottage
now
the
determined
self
assurance
was
in
his
stride
not
hers
the
cottage
window
was
not
boarded
over
brady
cupped
his
free
hand
and
peered
in
there
was
a
chaos
of
furniture
which
seemed
to
have
been
brought
in
from
some
porch
wicker
chairs
a
chaise
void
zero
gee
could
only
be
tolerated
for
so
long
in
a
stretch
then
weight
became
essential
to
health
under
continuous
boost
reaction
mass
would
presently
give
out
so
it
would
be
necessary
to
put
a
spin
on
the
ship
with
a
large
radius
in
order
to
minimize
centrifugal
variations
and
coriolis
effect
foreseeing
that
need
as
a
possibility
designers
had
included
provisions
against
it
when
they
worked
out
their
modifications
of
the
reina
class
the
hull
could
be
split
in
two
its
forward
and
after
halves
separated
that
involved
a
lot
of
work
only
part
of
which
could
be
done
by
explosive
seams
but
the
capability
was
there
a
cable
of
whisker
filaments
for
the
tensile
strength
would
connect
them
still
under
the
impetus
of
the
lateral
jets
they
d
motors
would
set
them
rotating
earth
normal
pseudogravity
would
thereafter
prevail
inboard
the
cable
would
carry
power
from
the
reactor
to
the
living
quarters
and
another
wheel
would
go
whirling
off
through
space
another
prison
brodersen
grimaced
not
for
the
first
time
at
the
prospect
of
carrying
out
such
a
job
with
his
inadequate
crew
it
was
a
sizzling
hell
of
a
lot
more
complicated
than
it
sounded
merely
balancing
masses
in
the
hemispheres
let
alone
scrambling
around
outside
in
spacesuits
we
ll
do
it
though
somehow
if
we
must
he
vowed
and
junk
that
rattlebrain
word
prison
huh
pegeen
will
be
here
to
die
at
last
he
made
a
gesture
of
thrusting
away
and
hauled
his
attention
outward
the
cylinder
gleamed
near
he
wondered
how
it
felt
to
joelle
and
fidelio
perceiving
directly
through
the
instruments
while
they
piloted
the
vessel
through
forces
that
negated
space
time
he
d
never
know
that
experience
lay
beyond
words
it
was
mystical
maybe
transmystical
he
d
better
they
themselves
had
no
idea
what
they
would
emerge
into
what
they
might
instantly
have
to
understand
and
do
and
here
comes
the
beacon
hard
off
our
port
bow
the
siren
whooped
warning
the
hull
swung
about
and
plunged
chinook
passed
through
first
he
stared
wildly
around
after
a
t
machine
the
heart
drummed
in
his
breast
he
saw
it
afar
a
staff
laid
across
blackness
and
the
breath
gusted
from
him
in
a
shout
next
he
grew
aware
of
how
much
blackness
there
was
no
stars
shone
behind
that
rod
well
nigh
every
line
of
sight
was
empty
of
all
but
night
inpone
burned
a
lurid
blue
white
spark
at
the
middle
of
a
pearly
haze
which
spread
out
on
either
side
like
wings
elsewhere
well
apart
he
discerned
faint
points
of
light
and
a
few
small
cloudy
glows
motors
off
the
ship
fell
silent
through
the
dark
my
god
brodersen
mumbled
where
are
we
action
snapped
to
life
in
him
report
by
stations
shaken
voices
told
him
nobody
had
come
to
harm
yet
joelle
spoke
last
as
if
in
dreams
fidelio
and
i
think
we
know
already
what
s
happened
it
is
very
strange
abruptly
machine
like
we
need
more

accelerate
at
about
forty
five
degrees
to
our

around
that

and
be
prepared
for
further
instructions
aye
aye
brodersen
said
a
small
part
of
him
wondered
why
his
obedience
was
so
automatic
the
joelle
he
recalled
who
liked
him
and
indulged
his
wish
for
her
company
even
for
what
little
of
her
knowledge
he
could
comprehend
but
always
remained
at
heart
aloof
she
was
no
more
what
he
had
embraced
a
few
nightwatches
ago
was
an
oldish
woman
yes
spinsterish
pathetically
eager
for
him
at
first
then
wistful
in
her
stiff
fashion
and
helpless
looking
after
she
fell
asleep
since
she
d
busied
herself
discussing
most
of
her
spare
time
in
her
cabin
and
been
short
spoken
at
mess
embarrassed
he
speculated
though
he
could
nt
figure
out
why
she
should
be
however
her
brain
is
still
good
and
right
now
it
s
enhanced
beyond
my
poor
imagining
weight
returned
brodersen
knew
at
least
a
trio
of
grounds
for
building
up
speed
doppler
measurements
improved
sampling
of
ambient
conditions
such
as
solar
wind
cameras
detecting
planets
as
streaks
across
the
background
of
the
stars
but
where
are
the
stars
this
system
holds
nothing
for
us
until
sure
that
everything
was
okay
he
ought
to
stay
put
in
the
command
center
however
unless
an
emergency
came
up
he
was
supernumerary
he
fiddled
with
controls
and
peered
at
meters
trying
to
learn
what
he
might
the
blue
white
fierceness
which
joelle
had
called
a
sun
was
really
brilliant
the
optics
stopped
its
radiance
way
down
it
was
giving
chinook
illumination
comparable
to
what
sol
gives
earth
but
even
at
high
magnification
the
disc
showed
tiny
selective
scanning
and
amplification
he
managed
to
find
a
lesser
companion
yellow
nearly
lost
in
the
glare
the
fuzzy
patches
scattered
around
heaven
turned
out
to
contain
points
of
light
enmeshed
in
luminous
mist
and
intricate
filaments
they
must
be
orion
type
nebulae
close
by
where
new
suns
were
forming
out
of
dust
and
gas
as
he
watched
for
the
most
part
what
had
appeared
to
be
individual
stars
were
in
fact
star
clusters
widely
separated
reports
from
the
astrolab
started
arriving
beyond
range
of
ordinary
viewscreens
but
plentiful
within
the
reach
of
the
observatory
equipment
were
more
nebulae
in
a
particular
direction
was
a
huge
region
invisible
to
the
eye
violently
radiating
in
the
infra
red
and
radio
wavelengths
throughout
the
entire
sky
was
no
trace
of
the
familiar
external
galaxies
though
it
held
sources
of
similar
radiation
more
and
more
of
these
results
as
the
hours
wore
on
were
reached
under
fidelio
s
management
he
told
the
humans
what
to
look
for
and
they
found
it
he
place
chinook
had
gotten
into
brodersen
puffed
his
pipe
he
believed
he
could
guess
the
answer
himself
it
boomed
through
him
like
the
toning
of
a
great
bell
su
being
co
opted
to
do
scutwork
for
the
researchers
caitlin
was
preparing
dinner
solo
hitherto
no
one
had
it
he
probably
thought
that
women
gave
birth
as
easily
as
ewes
she
decided
he
was
oblivious
to
the
pain
of
contractions
and
that
awful
impossible
stretching
and
the
soreness
afterward
and
the
bossy
know
it
all
nurses
who
did
nt
want
you
to
touch
your
baby
because
you
were
nt
brisk
and
efficient
and
trained
and
sterile
like
they
were
he
just
saw
you
go
away
pregnant
and
come
back
with
a
beautiful
white
wrapped
call
him
jonathan
they
added
alfred
for
david
s
father
and
malcolm
for
lucy
s
and
thomas
for
old
tom
but
they
called
the
boy
jo
because
he
was
too
tiny
for
jonathan
let
alone
jonathan
alfred
malcolm
thomas
rose
david
learned
to
give
him
his
bottle
and
burp
him
and
change
his
diaper
and
he
even
dangled
him
in
his
lap
occasionally
but
his
interest
seemed
distant
uninvolved
he
had
a
problem
solving
approach
like
the
nurses
it
was
not
for
him
as
it
was
for
lucy
tom
was
closer
to
the
baby
than
david
lucy
would
not
let
him
smoke
in
the
room
where
the
baby
was
and
the
old
boy
would
put
his
great
briar
pipe
with
the
lid
in
his
pocket
for
hours
and
gurgle
at
little
jo
or
watch
him
kick
his
feet
or
help
lucy
bathe
him
lucy
suggested
mildly
that
he
might
be
neglecting
the
sheep
tom
said
they
did
not
need
him
to
watch
them
feed
he
would
rather
watch
jo
feed
it
with
small
round
pebbles
and
was
overjoyed
when
jo
grabbed
it
and
shook
it
first
time
without
having
to
be
shown
how
david
and
lucy
still
did
not
make
love
first
there
had
been
his
injuries
and
then
she
had
been
pregnant
and
then
she
had
been
recovering
from
childbirth
but
now
the
reasons
had
run
out
one
night
she
said
i
m
back
to
normal
now
how
do
you
mean
after
the
baby
my
body
is
normal
i
ve
healed
oh
i
see
that
s
good
eye
of
the
needle
she
made
sure
to
go
to
bed
with
him
so
that
he
could
watch
her
undress
but
he
always
turned
his
back
as
they
lay
there
dozing
off
she
would
move
so
that
her
hand
or
her
thigh
or
her
breast
brushed
against
him
a
casual
but
unmistakable
invitation
there
was
no
response
she
believed
firmly
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
her
simply
want
sex
she
wanted
sex
with
david
she
was
sure
that
even
if
there
had
been
another
man
under
seventy
on
the
island
she
would
not
have
been
tempted
she
was
nt
a
sex
starved
tart
she
was
a
love
starved
wife
the
crunch
came
on
one
of
those
nights
when
they
lay
on
their
backs
side
by
side
both
wide
awake
listening
to
the
wind
outside
and
the
small
sounds
of
jo
from
the
next
room
it
seemed
to
lucy
that
it
was
time
he
either
did
it
or
came
right
out
and
said
why
not
and
that
he
was
going
to
avoid
the
issue
until
she
forced
it
and
that
she
might
as
well
force
it
now
so
she
brushed
her
arm
across
his
thighs
and
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
and
almost
cried
out
with
shock
to
discover
that
he
had
an
erection
so
he
could
do
it
and
he
wanted
to
or
why
else
and
her
hand
closed
triumphantly
around
the
evidence
of
his
desire
and
she
shifted
closer
he
said
oh
for
god
s
sake
and
gripped
her
wrist
and
pushed
her
hand
away
from
him
and
turned
onto
his
side
but
this
time
she
was
not
going
to
accept
his
rebuff
in
modest
silence
david
why
not
jesus
christ
he
threw
the
blankets
off
swung
himself
to
the
floor
grabbed
the
eiderdown
with
one
hand
and
dragged
himself
to
the
door
lucy
sat
up
in
bed
and
screamed
at
him
why
not
jo
began
to
cry
david
pulled
up
the
empty
legs
of
his
cut
off
pajama
trousers
pointed
to
the
pursed
white
skin
of
his
stumps
and
said
that
s
why
not
that
s
why
not
he
slithered
downstairs
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
and
lucy
went
into
the
next
bedroom
to
comfort
jo
it
took
a
long
time
to
lull
him
back
to
sleep
probably
because
she
herself
was
so
much
in
need
of
comfort
the
baby
tasted
the
tears
on
her
cheeks
inkling
of
their
meaning
would
nt
tears
be
one
of
the
first
things
a
baby
came
to
understand
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
sing
to
him
or
murmur
that
everything
was
all
right
so
she
held
him
tight
and
rocked
him
and
when
he
had
soothed
her
with
his
warmth
and
his
clinging
he
went
to
sleep
in
her
arms
she
put
him
back
in
the
cot
and
stood
looking
at
him
for
a
while
there
was
no
point
in
going
back
to
bed
she
could
hear
david
s
deep
sleep
snoring
from
the
living
room
he
had
to
take
powerful
pills
otherwise
the
old
pain
kept
him
awake
lucy
needed
to
get
away
from
him
where
she
could
neither
see
nor
hear
him
where
he
could
nt
find
her
for
a
few
hours
even
if
he
wanted
to
she
put
on
trou
sers
and
a
sweater
a
heavy
coat
and
boots
and
crept
down
stairs
and
out
there
was
a
swirling
mist
damp
and
bitterly
cold
the
kind
the
island
coat
thought
about
going
back
inside
for
a
scarf
and
de
cided
not
to
she
squelched
along
the
muddy
path
welcom
ing
the
bite
of
the
fog
in
her
throat
the
small
discomfort
of
the
weather
taking
her
mind
off
the
larger
hurt
inside
her
she
reached
the
cliff
top
and
walked
gingerly
down
the
steep
narrow
ramp
placing
her
feet
carefully
on
the
slip
pery
boards
at
the
bottom
she
jumped
off
on
to
the
sand
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
the
wind
and
the
water
were
carrying
on
their
perpetual
anyway
i
want
you
to
check
her
out
eban
everything
start
back
at
the
supermarket
did
she
see
much
of
jordon
while
she
was
still
working
there
was
there
gossip
was
there
someone
she
confided
in
understand
how
about
this
stanley
guy
asked
mclure
now
he
threatened
him
according
to
gore
we
ve
got
to
pick
him
up
of
course
and
no
we
do
nt
hugh
said
jennings
we
ve
got
him
something
else
a
little
while
ago
and
they
told
me
they
found
him
on
fairbanks
street
fast
asleep
in
his
car
drunk
as
a
skunk
one
of
the
residents
notified
the
police
and
they
took
him
in
he
s
sleeping
it
off
in
a
cell
right
now
good
so
that
leaves
only
the
young
fellow
billy
put
out
an
all
points
on
him
let
s
see
if
we
can
get
it
on
the
early
evening
news
make
it
plain
that
he
s
not
a
suspect
just
that
we
re
interested
in
information
that
he
might
give
jennings
wrote
in
his
notebook
and
then
looked
up
inquiringly
anything
else
hugh
yeah
go
on
home
and
get
yourself
a
decent
meal
i
ll
see
you
at
the
stationhouse
afterward
since
rabbi
small
did
not
turn
on
either
the
radio
or
on
the
sabbath
it
was
not
until
he
arrived
at
the
temple
for
the
evening
service
that
he
heard
about
the
murder
the
dozen
lot
less
observant
of
the
sabbath
than
the
rabbi
and
hence
knew
all
about
it
most
of
them
were
listening
to
julius
rottenberg
who
was
a
maven
that
is
an
expert
in
matters
criminological
by
virtue
of
operating
a
coffee
shop
just
outside
the
law
courts
in
the
neighboring
city
of
lynn
and
who
therefore
was
on
intimate
terms
with
the
district
attorney
coffee
and
a
cruller
and
heavy
on
the
cream
the
assistant
d
a
s
all
the
cops
and
even
the
presiding
judge
tea
with
lemon
and
a
little
extra
hot
water
julius
it
s
the
kid
of
course
he
was
saying
when
the
rabbi
entered
the
chapel
where
they
were
waiting
to
begin
the
service
fat
and
bald
and
normally
with
a
perpetual
eager
smile
julius
now
showed
a
fine
high
scorn
for
someone
who
had
suggested
that
it
could
be
some
stranger
from
his
past
who
had
shot
ellsworth
jordon
nah
he
said
with
an
impatient
sweep
it
gives
them
an
out
see
but
it
was
the
kid
that
did
it
he
s
crazy
about
guns
all
kids
are
what
do
you
expect
with
all
these
westerns
on
the
tube
and
the
gang
pictures
too
he
pinches
the
gun
out
of
the
bank
where
he
works
to
hold
up
somebody
or
even
to
fire
it
in
the
woods
nah
just
to
fondle
it
to
practice
a
quick
draw
maybe
or
twirling
it
around
his
finger
like
the
gunmen
do
in
the
westerns
so
the
old
man
catches
him
with
it
and
makes
him
put
it
down
and
sends
him
to
his
room
then
everybody
leaves
there
was
some
sort
of
dinner
party
and
the
old
man
sits
down
in
his
easy
chair
to
grab
himself
forty
winks
so
they
re
all
alone
and
the
old
man
is
asleep
so
the
kid
leaves
his
room
to
get
another
look
at
the
gun
to
hold
it
and
wave
it
around
and
it
goes
sure
so
he
figures
he
might
as
well
get
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
for
a
lamb
so
he
fires
away
until
the
gun
is
empty
and
when
he
s
finished
jordon
is
dead
yeah
but
why
did
nt
jordon
jump
up
and
stop
him
julius
julius
nodded
with
pompous
solemnity
good
question
my
theory
is
that
the
old
man
panicked
and
froze
a
new
arrival
announced
hey
guys
i
just
heard
that
the
cops
arrested
stanley
stanley
our
stanley
what
for
i
do
nt
know
all
i
heard
was
he
was
arrested
did
you
see
him
around
today
he
was
nt
here
last
night
either
look
in
the
vestry
and
you
ll
see
all
the
stuff
from
the
collation
the
dirty
dishes
they
re
still
on
the
table
you
think
we
ought
to
clean
up
that
s
the
house
committee
s
business
throughout
the
service
the
he
performed
perfunctorily
even
the
havdala
ceremony
that
divided
the
sabbath
from
the
rest
of
the
week
what
kept
running
through
his
head
was
that
if
jordon
was
dead
and
if
henry
maltzman
had
been
right
about
him
then
the
temple
might
now
be
able
to
buy
the
adjoining
land
for
the
religious
school
a
little
ashamed
of
his
thoughts
and
his
inability
to
concentrate
on
the
prayers
the
rabbi
did
not
stand
around
and
talk
with
the
members
of
the
minyan
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
as
he
usually
did
but
excused
himself
and
went
right
home
he
had
no
sooner
entered
the
house
when
the
phone
rang
rabbi
small
he
announced
from
the
other
end
came
a
hoarse
chuckle
i
figured
you
d
be
getting
home
right
about
now
rabbi
stanley
that
s
right
i
m
down
at
the
stationhouse
and
they
said
i
could
make
a
phone
call
you
mean
you
ve
been
arrested
what
for
what
s
the
little
drunk
all
right
i
ll
be
down
and
talk
with
them
the
desk
sergeant
looked
at
rabbi
small
doubtfully
and
said
gee
i
do
nt
know
rabbi
you
re
not
a
lawyer
are
you
i
mean
you
do
nt
have
a
law
degree
do
you
no
because
he
s
got
a
right
to
see
his
lawyer
of
course
but
i
do
nt
know
about
anybody
else
i
guess
it
would
be
all
right
if
you
were
his
spiritual
advisor
but
stanley
not
being
jewish
his
spiritual
advisor
would
have
to
be
a
minister
or
a
priest
depending
on
if
he
was
catholic
or
protestant
see
what
i
mean
i
mean
just
because
he
works
at
your
temple
would
nt
make
you
his
spiritual
advisor
and
your
not
being
a
lawyer
forgotten
the
snowfield
of
peru
and
his
shepherd
friend
in
the
hills
most
of
legs
outstretched
watching
the
children
and
soothing
his
joints
with
snowpacks
it
was
nt
until
jess
slapped
him
on
the
back
that
he
remembered
mario
and
the
car
you
ll
never
believe
it
jess
said
excitedly
they
found
my
car
this
morning
over
in
culver
city
carmela
glanced
at
fausto
in
one
piece
perfect
the
tank
s
about
empty
but
that
s
all
i
was
sure
the
engine
d
be
torn
up
carmela
put
an
arm
around
jess
s
waist
great
i
m
glad

ripped
it
off
in
el
sereno
that
s
twenty
miles
away
i
do
nt
know
jess
looked
at
the
snow
for
the
first
time
he
was
carmela
s
height
but
his
strong
jaw
and
wide
handsome
face
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
larger
man
they
said
everyone
a
truck
dump
a
load
it
snowed
fausto
said
sure
how
much
did
it
cost

carmela

climbed
out

slush
and
fausto
remained
alone
on
the
levee
someone
had
loaned
him
a
blanket
and
he
lay
on
the
lawnchair
with
only
his
face
and
of
a
cigarette
stub

too
bad
he

nt
been

snow

of
mrs
noriega
s
enchiladas
or
a
little
soup
tio

carmela
approached
the
dark
figure
by
the
bank
s
edge
careful
not
to
slip
on
the
water
or
trip
on
the
snowmen
she
touched
his
shoulder
ready
to
go

jess

unload
the
groceries
from

fausto

he
was
on
the
floor
fingering
the
lint
under
the
bed

something

in
the
bathtub
carmela

turn
on
the

of

flipped
the
switch
and
glanced
into
the
hallway

tio
fausto
crept
forward
there
you
are
come
to
daddy
that
s
it
come
to
daddy
what

carmela
asked
peeking
under
the
bed
with
his
index
finger
and
thumb
fausto
picked
up
the
lint
and
carefully
placed
it
on
his
right
leg
i
was
afraid
you
d
step
on
it
sometimes
they
crawl
off
the
bed
and
get
lost
something
s
in
the
bathtub
he
patted
the
flacid
pallid
a
little
bit
like
peddling
you
re
showing
excellent
judgment
what
about
ambassador
to
the
u
n
do
nt
make
me
laugh
what
do
you
think
about
secretary
of
the
treasury
gold
pricked
up
his
ears
what
what
would
i
have
to
do
i
think
i
could
find
out
harris
rosenblatt
would
know
most
of
them
are
very
rich
and
seem
to
care
about
money
i
care
about
money
but
they
know
about
it
gold
declined
with
regret
i
m
not
sure
i
d
be
comfortable
i
msupposed
to
be
something
of
a
pacifist
and
a
radical
reformer
but
a
conservative
radical
reformer
bruce
ralph
reminded
that
s
true
imagine
what
a
blessing
it
might
be
to
have
you
in
the
department
of
defense
gold
had
an
inspiration
how
about
secretary
of
defense
that
s
good
bruce
especially
for
a
pacifist
but
i
m
only
a
pacifist
in
times
of
peace
we
ll
put
it
clown
ralph
added
to
his
list
and
then
there
s
head
of
the
fbi
or
ia
to
consider
would
i
believe
so
and
wrote
those
down
too
these
are
all
good
bruce
someone
with
your
flair
for
publicity
could
probably
get
your
name
in
the
newspapers
almost
as
often
as
the
secretary
of
state
what
about
secretary
of
state
asked
gold
that
s
a
thought
said
ralph
would
nt
i
have
to
know
anything
absolutely
not
ralph
answered
and
appeared
astounded
that
gold
even
should
ask
in
government
bruce
experience
does
nt
count
and
knowledge
is
nt
important
if
there
s
one
lesson
of
value
to
be
learned
from
the
past
bruce
it
s
to
grab
what
you
want
when
the
chance
comes
to
get
it
gold
asked
with
distress
is
that
good
for
the
world
nothing
s
good
for
the
world
bruce
i
thought
you
knew
that
you
ve
more
or
less
said
the
same
in
that
last
piece
of
yours
now
bruce
ralph
continued
awkwardly
i
have
better
wife
than
belle
gold
was
elated
i
m
sorry
ralph
was
solemn
belle
would
be
okay
for
labor
or
agriculture
but
not
for
secretary
of
state
or
defense
belle
and
i
have
not
been
close
gold
confided
in
that
case
i
m
happy
said
ralph
try
someone
tall
this
time
bruce
you
re
rather
short
you
know
it
would
add
to
your
stature
if
you
had
a
tall
wife
would
nt
a
tall
wife
make
me
look
smaller
inquired
gold
no
said
ralph
you
would
make
her
look
taller
and
that
would
add
more
to
your
stature
and
make
her
look
smaller
andrea
conover
would
be
perfect
i
m
seeing
her
tonight
is
she
tall
enough
oh
easily
and
her
father
is
a
dying
career
diplomat
with
tons
of
money
and
the
best
connections
propose
tonight
nt
seen
her
for
seven
years
so
what
ralph
laughed
back
in
encouragement
you
can
always
get
a
divorce
andrea
s
doing
a
great
job
with
the
oversight
committee
on
government
expenditures
she
s
the
reason
wepca
nt
make
personal
phone
calls
any
more
you
know
bruce
gold
rose
when
ralph
did
these
are
really
our
golden
years
that
period
when
men
like
us
are
appealing
to
all
classes
of
women
between
sixteen
and
sixty
five
i
hope
you
re
making
the
most
of
them
a
lot
of
them
go
for
your
kind
my
kind
whatever
currents
of
euphoria
had
been
coursing
through
gold
s
veins
congealed
yes
said
ralph
what
do
you
mean
by
my
kind
gold
asked
ralph
the
kind
of
person
you
are
bruce
why
as
opposed
to
what
other
kinds
ralph
the
kinds
of
person
you
are
nt
bruce
why
do
you
ask
and
then
decided
to
take
the
inky
plunge
lieberman
thinks
you
re
anti
semitic
ralph
was
stunned
me
his
voice
was
hurt
and
astonished
bruce
i
would
feel
just
awful
if
i
thought
i
ever
did
or
said
a
single
thing
to
give
you
that
impression
ralph
was
sincere
and
gold
was
contrite
you
have
nt
ralph
i
m
sorry
i
brought
it
up
thank
you
bruce
ralph
was
placated
and
his
handsome
face
fairly
shone
with
grace
when
he
grinned
why
i
copied
your
papers
at
columbia
you
practically
put
me
through
graduate
school
it
s
just
that
i
really
do
nt
feel
lieberman
is
an
especially
nice
person
he
is
nt
gold
laughed
and
i
ve
known
him
all
my
life
the
strain
gone
ralph
said
let
me
take
these
notes
to
dusty
and
have
her
type
them
up
we
ve
really
covered
a
lot
of
ground
today
but
never
in
his
lifetime
had
he
felt
more
sanguine
about
his
prospects
he
glanced
out
the
window
at
official
washington
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
heaven
through
the
doorway
the
view
of
the
open
office
space
was
a
soothing
pastoral
with
vistas
of
modular
desks
dozing
tranquilly
under
indirect
fluorescentlighting
that
never
flickered
there
were
shoulder
high
partitions
of
translucent
glass
other
offices
across
the
way
as
imposingas
ralph
s
and
the
dreamlike
stirrings
of
contented
people
at
work
who
were
in
every
respect
impeccable
the
women
allpwere
sunny
and
chic
not
a
single
one
was
overweight
the
men
wore
jackets
and
ties
and
every
trouser
leg
was
properly
creased
if
there
was
a
worm
at
the
core
in
this
garden
of
eden
it
escaped
the
cynical
inspection
of
gold
who
could
find
detritus
and
incipient
decay
everywhere
gold
could
look
through
a
grapefruit
and
tell
if
it
was
pink
you
ll
like
it
here
wo
nt
you
said
ralph
reading
his
mind
is
it
always
like
this
him
it
s
always
like
this
when
it
s
this
way
gold
succeeded
in
speaking
without
sarcasm
how
is
it
when
it
is
nt
is
nt
what
bruce
this
way
different
in
what
way
ralph
in
different
ways
bruce
unless
they
re
the
same
in
which
case
it
s
this
way
ralph
gold
had
to
ask
do
nt
people
here
laugh
or
smile
when
you
talk
that
way
what
way
bruce
you
seem
missing
i
love
you
tom
i
wondered
if
you
d
ever
say
that
you
never
asked
me
if
i
did
what
you
have
to
ask
for
s
no
good
beggars
do
nt
think
so
kid
i
m
no
beggar
thieves
do
nt
even
ask
if
it
ai
nt
a
gift
i
do
nt
want
it
it
s
a
gift
we
woke
just
at
sunup
tom
had
to
be
in
louisville
early
i
had
to
look
after
wanda
nora
is
wrong
i
told
tom
worse
than
an
eskimo
poor
girl
said
tom
i
dressed
before
i
went
into
wanda
s
room
put
your
he
wo
nt
be
here
until
night
he
might
surprise
us
someday
but
out
of
habit
i
put
on
the
switch
we
had
the
first
strawberries
of
the
season
for
breakfast
if
lindy
was
here
it
would
be
perfect
wanda
said
not
for
me
or
lindy
said
tom
how
about
you
orpha
i
m
happy
just
as
we
are
after
tom
left
i
took
my
switch
off
again
i
was
floating
floating
and
it
seemed
to
weigh
me
down
wanda
who
noticed
everything
noticed
if
i
hear
papa
turn
in
the
drive
i
ll
let
you
know
i
was
teaching
the
child
deception
there
were
a
thousand
things
i
wanted
to
do
that
day
among
them
was
to
put
some
words
into
my
book
of
unspoken
thoughts
if
tom
had
been
there
they
would
have
been
spoken
in
a
way
ipwas
still
talking
to
him
and
wonderings
the
night
before
unless
you
are
crazy
nasty
acts
make
you
feel
nasty
afterward
only
lunatics
enjoy
killing
flies
or
slapping
babies
or
eating
so
much
they
puke
unless
you
are
crazy
an
act
that
makes
you
love
the
whole
world
can
not
be
nasty
where
there
is
no
feeling
at
all
the
act
is
not
nasty
the
unresponding
body
takes
no
message
to
the
brain
nasty
is
the
brain
s
word
the
bumblebee
is
also
small
and
quick
but
one
knows
that
it
has
been
there
to
receive
and
give
simultaneously
if
a
flower
could
love
us
when
we
inhale
its
scent
if
a
sunset
could
respond
to
its
admirers
with
a
deeper
crimson
wanda
and
i
painted
a
beautiful
picture
of
a
farmhouse
that
day
dusted
the
rungs
of
chairs
beat
braided
rugs
gently
bade
every
picture
hang
even
scoured
the
stains
out
of
teacups
and
the
same
colored
stains
out
of
chamber
pots
bon
ami
ed
the
front
windows
made
strawberry
shortcake
for
supper
also
i
eat
a
boiled
pea
unaccompanied
by
any
sauce
fried
chicken
made
gravy
if
jake
thought
the
splendor
was
all
for
him
that
was
not
intentional
deceit
on
my
part
the
house
shine
and
food
savor
were
the
result
of
a
happiness
that
did
nt
permit
standing
still
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
letting
jake
share
that
bounty
was
there
at
six
without
being
warned
by
wanda
i
had
my
hair
back
on
the
table
set
biscuits
and
shortcake
in
the
oven
jake
did
nt
come
at
six
or
seven
or
eight
in
the
first
months
this
had
worried
me
had
the
car
gone
over
a
cliff
a
runaway
horse
crashed
into
him
a
bridge
collapsed
jake
was
always
late
maybe
an
hour
or
two
maybe
as
now
until
next
day
i
did
nt
worry
any
more
i
did
fume
why
could
nt
he
let
me
know
we
had
a
phone
he
knew
that
i
worried
i
had
walked
with
a
lantern
one
south
fork
of
the
rattatack
where
i
was
afraid
the
bridge
might
have
gone
out
it
had
nt
and
jake
overtook
me
homeward
bound
and
soaking
wet
jake
had
two
kinds
of
pride
one
as
a
businessman
the
other
as
a
householder
the
businessman
s
pride
was
never
to
be
late
the
householder
s
was
never
to
be
on
time
neither
ebon
nor
nettie
had
phones
papa
and
mama
did
not
want
to
make
the
long
drive
at
that
hour
of
the
evening
so
wanda
and
i
ate
the
good
food
alone
pussy
ate
a
whole
chicken
wing
on
a
sheet
of
the
louisville
courier
after
supper
i
reread
some
of
joe
s
letters
i
sat
in
a
rocking
chair
home
of
the
hurt
wanda
was
on
my
lap
and
on
her
lap
was
pussy
pussy
purred
i
rocked
wanda
stroked
i
read
joe
s
letters
aloud
they
were
all
about
jesus
was
jesus
a
storybook
man
to
wanda
a
magician
a
santa
claus
before
favors
the
way
you
asked
santa
for
presents
only
jesus
of
course
made
promises
ask
and
ye
shall
receive
santa
said
be
good
were
my
unspoken
thoughts
really
talk
with
jesus
in
any
case
he
knew
them
could
i
have
put
them
down
if
i
had
believed
that
no
eye
would
see
no
ear
hear
maybe
in
the
beehive
of
the
brain
thoughts
that
never
escape
buzz
around
the
cranium
night
and
day
with
pen
and
paper
i
cracked
the
cranium
freed
the
thoughts
and
stopped
the
buzzing
did
i
ever
see
uncle
joe
mama
no
you
never
did
does
he
look
like
you
no
he
s
handsome
what
s
a
seminary
a
school
where
men
go
to
learn
to
be
preachers
can
women
go
no
why
not
do
nt
god
love
women
god
did
nt
make
a
lodge
like
the
odd
fellows
kind
of
can
uncle
joe
really
see
jesus
yes
can
you
no
you
pray
he
could
nt
hear
you
if
he
was
nt
there
could
he
no
he
s
there
all
right
but
only
the
pure
in
heart
can
see
him
if
i
prayed
hard
could
i
see
him
if
you
had
enough
faith
i
do
nt
said
wanda
i
will
never
see
jesus
but
i
love
him
and
he
loves
me
i
rocked
pussy
purred
wanda
stroked
joe
wrote
i
think
my
sickness
was
only
the
effort
of
my
flesh
to
tell
me
something
about
my
soul
my
soul
could
rot
and
bleed
and
i
would
never
have
noticed
it
never
of
the
egyptians
and
the
hebrews
jeremiah
ezekiel
elijah
deborah
spiritual
jewels
were
often
sent
and
raiment
of
silk
and
velvet
wine
and
fruit
homely
items
such
as
brooms
and
wreaths
of
bright
flowers
gifts
of
love
and
humility
came
down
and
golden
chains
and
trumpets
and
silver
swords
all
of
these
were
received
through
certain
sisters
and
so
today
sister
phebe
waited
in
the
ministers
apartment
next
to
the
meeting
hall
and
those
without
waited
too
for
their
christmas
gift
from
the
world
beyond
at
into
the
shape
of
a
heart
and
covered
with
fine
script
as
if
she
were
walking
in
her
sleep
she
passed
unseeing
into
the
center
of
the
room
in
a
high
clear
voice
she
began
to
read
beloved
i
send
you
this
day
my
best
love
and
my
choicest
gifts
a
basket
of
cakes
of
love
a
silver
chalice
filled
with
the
water
of
life
raiment
of
strength
and
comfort
a
flock
of
white
doves
to
bring
you
peace
as
she
read
the
family
listened
with
rapt
attention
like
well
trained
actors
in
a
play
they
followed
the
cues
which
sister
phebe
read
to
them
pantomiming
they
passed
around
the
basket
and
each
took
her
or
his
portion
of
the
love
they
drank
from
the
silver
chalice
they
adorned
themselves
with
the
silken
shawls
and
golden
crowns
how
generous
was
mother
ann
how
deeply
solicitous
of
their
welfare
an
onlooking
gentile
might
see
nothing
might
mock
their
credulity
but
they
believed
they
ate
and
as
if
it
had
been
palpable
in
their
hands
as
perhaps
it
was
finally
sister
phebe
paused
as
if
for
dramatic
effect
they
understood
that
she
had
something
more
to
tell
them
they
waited
all
expectant
muted
excitement
filled
the
room
with
an
almost
palpable
tension
tell
us
they
begged
although
not
a
word
was
heard
what
is
your
message
mother
ann
in
little
more
than
three
years
time
said
sister
phebe
will
come
a
revolution
it
will
be
a
political
revolution
and
therefore
none
of
your
affair
but
mark
it
well
for
it
will
be
the
signal
for
the
millennium
far
away
across
the
sea
men
will
fight
each
other
you
will
hear
of
it
for
some
of
the
defeated
will
find
their
way
to
you
welcome
them
and
remember
what
i
have
said
they
strained
to
hear
to
understand
what
had
revolution
to
do
with
them
the
millennium
she
had
promised
such
prophecies
often
weeks
before
the
news
arrivedfrom
france
and
they
had
heard
of
that
wonderful
new
invention
the
telegraph
long
before
anyone
in
the
world
save
morse
himself
had
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
so
now
they
listened
to
this
latest
revelation
with
perfect
confidence
that
it
would
come
true
sister
phebe
stood
silent
before
them
her
head
bowed
her
hands
clasping
the
fine
scrawled
paper
then
her
rigid
form
swayed
slightly
like
a
sapling
in
a
gust
of
wind
her
knees
gave
way
and
she
coiled
gracefully
to
the
floor
three
brothers
gently
lifted
her
and
carried
her
to
the
retiring
room
the
meeting
ended
with
a
hymn
of
thanks
to
mother
ann
and
then
elder
james
opened
a
barrel
of
choice
apples
each
took
one
as
the
companymarched
out
to
the
dining
hall
for
christmas
dinner
sabra
bit
into
the
sweet
crisp
flesh
of
the
fruit
she
felt
the
cold
air
on
her
face
the
bright
landscape
hurting
her
eyes
these
things
were
real
the
hardpacked
snow
beneath
her
feet
the
tears
in
were
what
she
knew
what
she
understood
she
had
not
understood
what
had
passed
in
meeting
she
had
prayed
with
the
others
but
she
had
been
unable
in
good
conscience
to
pantomime
the
receiving
of
the
spiritual
gifts
she
had
not
known
that
such
things
happened
in
the
united
society
messages
from
the
spirit
world
had
not
been
part
of
the
bargain
i
can
accept
it
all
she
thought
the
work
the
isolation
from
the
world
the
prayers
and
dances
and
hymns
but
mesmerism
and
the
belief
in
spirits
no
that

not
christmas
dinner
was
a
bounteous
feast
sister
ruth
and
her
helpers
might
have
been
accused
of
the
sin
of
pride
had
anyone
been
mean
enough
to
carp
but
all
were
gratefully
hungry
and
as
each
new
dish
appeared
from
the
kitchen
it
as
quickly
disappeared
into
the
mouths
of
the
faithful
they
ate
oyster
cream
soup
and
stuffed
turkey
and
chestnut
pudding
ginger

and
pumpkin

and

and

applesauce

and

afterward
they
knelt
and
gave
special
thanks
this
day
for
all
their
blessings
that
evening
there
were
union
meetings
in
the
dormitories
sabra
came
in
late
from
her
visit
to
clara
as
she
slipped
into
her
chair
she
felt
the
comfortable
atmosphere
in
the
room
the
quiet
talk
the
easy
chuckles
the
warm
and
friendly
interest
of
brothers
and
sisters
each
for
all
she
saw
brother
william
but
philornena
although
she
had
been
recovered
some
days
since
was
not
among
the
sisters
but
of
course
not
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
attend
a
union
meeting
together
for
a
long
time
months
even
years
brother
william
spoke
easily
to
a
sister
opposite
him
sabra
did
not
know
her
name
his
face
was
unsmiling
but
he
seemed
calm
and
self
possessed
she
remembered
philomena
s
torture
pher
agonized
words
of
confession
had
brother
william
undergone
a
similar
torment
him
words
suddenly
came
into
her
mind
she
could
not
remember
where
she
had
read
them
he
for
god
and
she
for
god
in
him
but
it
was
so
there
was
always
that
impediment
even
shaker
women
seeking
god
had
first
to
put
men
out
of
their
hearts
welcome
the
stranger
said
mother
ann
for
he
will
be
your
friend
they
obeyed
her
in
this
as
in
all
else
and
the
more
visitors
who
came
to
inspect
them
the
more
they
saw
the
wisdom
of
her
words
for
strangers
who
came
had
intensified
and
different
growing
things
had
pushed
forward
their
warm
scents
something
within
her
had
begun
to
throb
his
hand
hunting
under
her
gown
had
found
the
throbbing
place
the
protecting
thong
around
her
thighs
seemingly
had
loosened
and
she
had
twisted
about
as
if
refusing
this
personal
invasion
but
the
earth
had
sided
with
the
man
pressing
as
hard
against
her
back
as
pesla
now
on
top
had
pressed
against
her
front
she
had
blinked
open
her
eyes
the
next
instant
he
had
flung
up
her
gown
half
her
body
exposed
to
his
gaze
and
then
she
had
learned
the
strength
of
his
arms
he
had
pulled
her
on
top
himself
up
to
his
mouth
where
he
had
tasted
her
for
sweetness
rolling
her
back
on
the
ground
he
had
spread
her
legs
and
so
she
had
discovered
the
strength
of
his
hands
and
then
she
had
known
hardness
and
push
and
pain
all
in
the
same
moment
she
had
seemed
floating
away
unknowing
where
and
so
she
had
shed
a
tear
stars
had
drifted
past
each
tiny
bright
sun
beyond
her
reach
she
had
tried
once
and
again
to
touch
even
one
and
when
they
all
had
disappeared
she
had
laughed
a
crazy
little
laugh
the
air
had
seemed
filled
with
a
strange
new
fragrance
something
more
than
flower
smell
more
than
creature
smell
and
gazing
up
at
the
dark
heads
of
the
tree
people
she
had
touched
her
own
face
and
hair
she
had
seen
where
pesla
lay
as
if
asleep
she
had
reached
out
her
hand
and
touched
him
touched
something
wet
and
sticky
that
now
belonged
to
her
the
man
feeling
her
touch
had
smiled
not
opening
his
eyes
he
had
reached
over
his
hand
and
touched
where
his
hardness
had
visited
her
touched
something
wet
and
warm
that
now
belonged
to
him
and
so
the
warrior
had
made
lowansa
his
wife
these
two
had
not
returned
at
once
to
the
encampment
instead
they
had
gone
visiting
among
the
sicangu
the
woman
s
relatives
welcoming
the
pair
in
their
lodges
gifting
this
man
and
wife
with
robes
and
hides
and
meat
and
a
horse
and
drag
for
carrying
back
these
gifts
to
the
titonwan
hoop
everywhere
they
went
pesla
had
appeared
eager
to
keep
his
wife
within
sight
lowansa
seventeen
had
worn
a
colorful
tie
around
her
gown
something
to
show
off
her
pleasingly
wide
hips
below
a
small
waist
and
fully
ripe
breasts
her
shape
and
pretty
face
certain
to
attract
glances
even
so
custom
permitted
crude
joking
between
pesla
and
certain
ones
among
his
new
affinal
relatives
jokes
that
had
led
to
much
teasing
laughing
the
son
of
ogle
had
displayed
a
remarkably
good
nature
and
lowansa
seeing
none
of
the
frightful
temper
he
had
turned
on
the
horse
had
begun
to
wish
that
pesla
stay
with
the
sicangu
that
they
raise
a
lodge
here
on
the
earth
smoke
then
suddenly
pesla
had
spoken
the
warrior
saying
that
they
shall
start
back
they
had
lived
away
from
the
mahto
camp
from
round
moon
to
round
moon
and
so
the
next
day
the
two
had
begun
traveling
north
the
ihoka
lodge
had
given
a
feast
for
pegla
and
his
wife
upon
their
return
and
the
pair
had
received
a
tipi
cover
along
with
many
different
gifts
and
so
lowansa
had
everything
she
had
wanted
for
a
lodge
from
backrests
even
a
bone
backrest
for
pesla
to
painted
containers
perhaps
enough
meat
folders
and
robe
holders
for
the
next
two
three
winters
joyfully
the
young
parents
then
waited
for
pala
to
bring
his
little
girl
the
daughter
of
his
dead
wife
into
her
lodge
but
he
had
not
brought
the
child
when
she
had
asked
for
a
reason
he
had
answered
saying
you
will
give
me
a
son
and
perhaps
a
daughter
let
the
girl
stay
in
my
mother
s
lodge
he
had
mentioned
his
mother
s
apparent
pleasure
in
her
grandchild
and
he
had
told
of
the
many
ways
this
little
one
resembled
the
small
daughter
who
had
died
choking
lowansa
had
not
dared
say
more
soon
the
young
woman
had
discovered
that
her
husband
stayed
easy
to
live
with
only
when
things
went
entirely
his
way
but
let
him
lose
his
meat
during
the
chase
or
hear
someone
dispute
one
of
his
schemes
and
then
his
anger
boiled
as
on
the
day
he
had
whipped
the
horse
a
glare
in
his
eyes
and
a
growl
in
his
throat
certainly
she
had
endeavored
to
please
him
her
grandmother
and
mother
had
taught
her
that
a
wife
shall
accept
the
husband
s
man
asks
that
a
certain
woman
becomes
his
wife
custom
gives
that
woman
the
privilege
of
refusing
for
her
own
reasons
but
once
she
accepts
a
man
she
accepts
his
nature
and
without
intent
of
making
change
neither
in
the
man
nor
in
the
child
who
shall
bear
a
piece
if
not
the
whole
of
his
nature
lowansa
had
noticed
also
that
pesla
s
most
disagreeable
moods
came
after
he
attended
a
meeting
in
the
ihoka
lodge
in
some
mysterious
way
these
clubmen
had
a
way
of
arousing
his
surliness
the
woman
had
made
a
true
observation
the
man
returned
from
each
gathering
of
the
ihoka
in
a
temper
that
invariably
upset
the
tipi
they
had
not
promoted
him
to
the
rank
he
desired
rattle
carrier
club
owner
lance
bearer
he
had
held
those
ranks
in
the
tokala
and
he
intended
to
hold
a
more
impressive
place
among
the
ihoka
they
used
his
wife
as
one
of
their
singers
and
they
had
honored
him
with
many
gifts
yet
at
the
feasts
he
sat
alongside
the
ordinary
members
and
they
had
refused
agreeable
to
painting
exactly
as
he
painted
to
walk
in
the
ihoka
procession
he
needed
to
find
one
person
willing
to
imitate
him
this
rule
and
one
more
rule
the
ihoka
emphasized
the
members
shall
live
as
brothers
none
quarreling
nor
giving
reason
for
a
quarrel
they
had
hinted
more
than
once
that
pella

angrily
replacing
the

such
force
that
it
jarred

and
prague
scofield
heard
the
footsteps
in
the
hallway
and
got
out
of
the
chair
he
walked
to
the
door
and
peered
through
the
tiny
disk
in
the
center
the
figure
of
a
man
passed
by
he
did
not
stop
at
the
door
across
the
way
the
entrance
to
the
suite
of
rooms
used
by
taleniekov
s
courier
bray
went
back
to
the
chair
and
sat
down
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
rim
staring
at
the
ceiling
it
had
been
three
days
since
the
race
in
the
streets
three
nights
since
he
d
taken
the

from
taleniekov

nights

on
the
unter

ten
years
before
it
had
been
a
strange
night
an
odd
race
a
finish
that
might
have
been
otherwise
kill
him
had
gradually
lost
its
urgency
for
bray
as
so
much
had
lost
urgency
the
courier
had
brought
it
upon
himself
the
soviet
had
gone
into
panic
and
pulled
out
a
four
inch
razor
sharp
blade
from
the
recesses
of
the
hotel
chair
and
attacked
his
death
was
due
to
scofield
s
reaction
it
was
not
the
premeditated
murder
planned
in
the
street
nothing
ever
changed
much
the
kgb
courier
had
been
used
by
taleniekov
the
man
was
convinced
that
beowulf
agate
was
coming
over
and
the
russian
who
brought
him
in
would
be
given
the
brassiest
medal
in
moscow
you
ve
been
tricked
bray
had
told
the
courier
impossible
the
soviet
had
yelled
it
s
taleniekov
it
certainly
is
and
he
chooses
a
man
from
the
unter
den
linden
to
make
contact
a
man
whose
face
he
knows
i
ll
never
forget
the
odds
were
that
i
d
lose
control
and
kill

what
are
you
going
to
do

some
of
my
severance
pay
you
re

no
yes
the
man
had
lunged
at
scofield
three
days
had
passed
since
that
moment
of
violence
three
mornings
since
scofield
had
deposited
the
package
at
the
embassy
and
sent
the
cipher
to
sevastopol
still
no
one
had
come
to
the
door
across
the
hall
and
that
was
not
normal
the
suite
was
leased
by
a
brokerage
house
in
bern
switzerland
to
be
available
for
its
executives
standard
procedure
for
international
businessmen
and
also
a
transparent
cover
for
a
soviet
drop
bray
had
forced
the
issue
the
cipher
and
the
courier
s
dead
body
had
to
provoke
someone
into
checking
the
suite
of
rooms
yet
no
one
had
it
did
not
make
sense
unless
part
of
taleniekov
s
cable
was
true
he
was
acting
alone
one
explanation
the
soviet
killer
had
been
terminated
and
before
retiring
to
an
isolated
life
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
grasnov
he
had
decided
to
settle
an
outstanding
debt
he
had
sworn
to
do
so
after
prague
the
message
had
been
clear
you
re
mine
beowulf
agate
someday
somewhere
i
ii
see
you
take
your
last
breath
a
brother
for
a
wife
the
husband
for
the
brother
it
was
vengeance
rooted
in
loathing
and
that
loathing
never
left
there
d
be
no
peace
for
either
of
them
until
the
end
came
for
one
it
was
better
to
know
that
now
thought
the
bray
rather
than
find
out
on
a
crowded
street
or
a
deserted
stretch
of
beach
with
a
knife
in
the
side
or
a
bullet
in
the
head
the
courier
s
death
was
an
accident
taleniekov
s
would
not
be
there
would
be
no
peace
until
they
met
and
then
death
would
come
one
way
or
the
other
it
was
a
question
now
of
drawing
the
russian
was
the
stalker
the
role
established
the
strategy
was
classic
tracks
clearly
defined
for
the
stalker
to
follow
and
at
the
chosen
moment
least
expected
thetracks
would
not
be
there
the
stalker
bewildered
exposed
the
trap
sprung
like
bray
taleniekov
could
travel
anywhere
he
wished
with
or
without
official
sanction
over
the
years
both
had
learned
too
many
methods
a
plethora
of
false
papers
were
out
there
for
purchase
hundreds
of
men
everywhere
ready
to
provide
concealment
or
transportation
cover
or
weapons
any
and
all
there
were
only
two
basic
requirements
identities
and
money
neither
he
nor
taleniekov
lacked
either
both
came
with
the
profession
the
identities
quite
naturally
the
moneyless
so
more
often
than
not
the
result
of
having
been
hung
by
bureaucratic
delays
in
the
forwarding
of
payments
demanded
every
specialist
worth
his
rank
had
his
own
personal
sources
of
funds
payments
exaggerated
monies
diverted
and
deposited
in
stable
territories
the
objective
was
neither
theft
nor
wealth
merely
survival

or
twice

learn
the
necessity
of
economic
back
ups
bray

under
various
names
in
paris
munich
london
geneva
and
lisbon
one
avoided
rome
and
the
communist
bloc
the
italian
treasury
was
madness
and
banking
in
the
eastern
satellites
too
corrupt
scofield
rarely
thought
about
the
money
that
was
his
for
the
spending
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
supposed
he
would
give
it
back
one
day
had
the
predatory
congdon
not
flirted
with
his
own
temptations
and
made
the
official
termination
so
complicated
bray
might
have
walked
in
the
next
morning
and
handed
him
the
bankbooks
not
now
the

had
told
him
so
it
wo
nt
suffer
too
much
so
it
wo
nt
have
to
drown
in
the
air
could
not
could
not
meet
the
eyes
the
fish
eyes
captain
s
captain
had
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
him
had
even
hated
him
at
that
moment
jimbo
had
more
tli
in
suspected
as
he
watched
captain
pick
up
the
still
twitching
trout
and
walk
grimly
toward
him
it
ca
nt
hurt
you
captain
had
said
it
s
just
i
said
do
it
goddamn
girl
jimbo
swirled
to
run
but
captain
caught
him
by
the
back
of
his
shirt
captain
cupped
the
back
of
jimbo
s
head
and
neck
in
one
of
his
huge
hands
and
with
the
other
slowly
rubbed
the
t
rout
over
jimbo
s
face
until
at
last
the
fish
hung
limp
and
dripping
jimbo
is
being
held
up
like
a
fish
his
mouth
feels
torn
a
tliumb
stuffs
a
gill
fingers
burn
scales
perhaps
he
is
dreaming
should
he
be
frightened
actually
he
is
numb
and
more
wes
these
things
than
feels
them
no
he
only
sees
them
he
does
not
feel
them
at
all
it
is
a
dream
it
is
the
old
fish
dream
a
dream
he
has
had
often
since
that
day
he
failed
at
fishing
the
pressure
is
gentle
a
gentle
squeezing
but
this
is
not
the
dah
dream
it
is
his
foot
his
right
foot
but
is
he
asleep
his
right
foot
is
being
held
is
warm
in
a
huge
hand
jimbo
blinks
his
eyes
in
the
darkness
the
dark
form
sitting
on
the
bed
beside
him
is
framed
in
the
hall
light
coming
through
the
open
door
soldierboy
the
dark
form
whispers
jimbo
can
smell
whiskey
the
warm
hand
holding
his
foot
is
damp
soldierboy
you
awake
yes
sir
jimbo
nods
in
the
darkness
you
want
to
camp
out
tonight
soldierboy
the
form
whispers
yes
yes
sir
jimbo
says
and
sits
up
jimbo
rubs
his
eyes
in
the
bright
hall
light
as
he
follows
the
slightly
weaving
captain
toward
the
kitchen
camping
out
hot
dog
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
captain
had
asked
him
to
camp
out
maybe
everything
was
all
right
now
maybe
it
did
nt
matter
that
he
had
failed
again
failed
today
at
the
dreamland
swimming
pool
failed
this
time
at
swimming
maybe
it
was
all
right
now
captain
had
gotten
him
up
right
and
captain
had
asked
him
to
have
to
go
to
summer
camp
after
all
maybe
swimming
would
not
matter
now
uncle
boomer
is
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
his
face
is
very
pale
in
the
bright
overhead
light
and
there
are
deep
shadows
under
his
eyes
and
in
the
hollows
of
his
cheeks
he
is
wearing
his
old
battered
gray
fedora
tilted
back
on
his
head
as
always
and
as
always
a
cigarette
dangles
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
with
his
fedora
and
his
thin
black
mustache
boomer
looks
to
jimbo
like
that
teevee
detective
boston
blackie
jimbo
wishes
he
had
a
fedora
and
a
thin
black
mustache
jimbo
wishes
he
was
a
teevee
detective
he
will
be
someday
all
right
someday
anyway
boomer
sure
does
nt
look
like
an
undertaker
which
is
what
he
is
worm
pies
boomer
always
says
that
s
my
business
worm
pies
hello
squirt
boomer
says
to
jimbo
in
his
deep
froggy
voice
the
source
of
his
nickname
jimbo
grins
at
him
uncle
the
kitchen
table
jimbo
blinks
then
rubs
his
eyes
jimbo
stares
at
the
snow
piled
tabletop
no
it
s
not
snow
jimbo
realizes
squinting
his
eyes
no
it
s
sugar
he
realizes
spotting
the
opened
sugar
canister
at
the
table
s
edge
sugar
two
maybe
three
pounds
of
sugar
white
and
sparkling
in
the
bright
light
spread
out
over
the
tabletop
shaped
into
little
rolling
hills
with
finger
tracks
traced
like
small
roads
through
them
damn
captain
says
jimbo
glances
up
at
captain
s
looming
weaving
form
at
the
end
of
the
table
i
went
to
wake
up
my
soldierboy
and
i
clean
forgot
to
relieve
myself
captain
says
you
forgot
to
go
potty
boomer
says
and
pours
a
water
glass
dearly
full
from
a
bottle
in
a
paper
bag
yes
yes
i
did
i
clean
forgot
to
drain
my
hog
captain
says
and
walks
unsteadily
back
toward
the
hallway
boomer
chuckles
and
takes
a
long
drink
from
the
water
then
puts
his
finger
iii
his
mouth
how
does
it
taste
squirt
boomer
asks
and
winks
the
ceiling
as
he
staggered
backward
it
was
a
costly
stagger
before
he
could
get
off
another
round
pedestrian
was
off
the
couch
and
the
toe
of
his
right
shoe
was
connecting
sharply
with
the
underpart
of
zarubkin
s
nose
the
russian
stood
suddenly
erect
pistol
still
in
hand
shut
his
eyes
then
collapsed
to
the
floor
like
an
empty
sack
he
did
not
stir
knight
knelt
over
him
uncurled
his
fingers
and
tossed
the
tokarev
onto
the
couch
he
s
dead
pedestrian
said
without
emotion
from
across
shit
knight
sat
on
the
floor
and
hugged
his
knees
a
dark
green
mercury
glided
to
a
halt
in
front
of
a
neatly
manicured
lawn
its
motor
died
but
the
driver
did
not
get
out
he
continued
to
sit
with
both
hands
on
the
wheel
staring
at
the
rearview
mirror
the
street
like
any
in
the
suburbs
at
this
time
of
morning
was
deserted
except
for
a
squat
mail
truck
making
its
rounds
as
the
truck
lumbered
around
a
corner
and
disappeared
from
sight
in
the
mirror
he
saw
the
familiar
buick
approaching
from
behind
it
pulled
over
just
in
back
of
him
he
stepped
out
of
his
car
walked
around
it
to
the
pavement
and
entered
the
buick
the
man
in
the
hat
sat
in
the
driver
s
seat
well
he
said
zarubkin
is
dead
except
for
little
lines
of
pain
that
appeared
briefly
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
the
man
in
the
hat
remained
impassive
he
did
said
how
do
you
know
one
of
our
people
was
stationed
in
front
of
rainbow
s
apartment
house
he
saw
the
body
removed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
could
he
be
mistaken
it
was
zarubkin
rainbow
and
pedestrian
were
seen
later
there
was
perspiration
in
the
creases
of
the
speaker
s
palms
he
waited
feeling
a
headache
coming
on
did
zarubkin
talk
we
do
nt
know
the
man
in
the
hat
did
not
move
he
blinked
several
times
then
said
very
quietly
i
want
to
make
something
very
clear
and
i
will
say
it
only
once
are
you
listening
yes
i
do
nt
care
how
you
do
it
he
began
in
the
same
even
voice
then
shouted
as
he
smashed
a
fist
down
on
the
dashboard
but
get
rid
of
rainbow
and
pedestrian
get
rid
of
them
both
the
other
man
bumped
his
head
on
his
it
s
coming
in
carl
barnes
said
consulting
a
pocket
size
notebook
we
ll
be
ready
to
go
by
the
twenty
fifth
at
the
outside
matter
of
fact
i
d
like
each
of
you
to
take
a
few
liters
home
next
week
the
lab
fridge
is
getting
crowded
he
sat
hunched
over
in
a
leather
chair
near
the
fireplace
anticipating
durst
s
pleasure
a
log
crackled
sending
a
morse
code
of
sparks
flying
as
it
settled
in
the
grate
you
re
sure
of
the
date
absolutely
frank
it
s
simple
arithmetic
and
a
double
shipment
just
arrived
is
that
safe
dr
glover
asked
except
for
the
anderson
broad
i
m
the
biology
department
and
she
does
nt
seem
to
notice
or
care
i
think
she
s
being
serviced
by
some
stud
from
tremont
which
is
a
lucky
break
for
us
miles
trumbull
guffawed
louella
anderson
that
cow
s
got
herself
a
boyfriend
than
she
is
gawd
trumbull
chuckled
i
guess
it
s
better
than
dipping
it
into
a
can
of
oil
but
not
much
he
slapped
the
arm
of
his
chair
carl
barnes
and
the
doctor
joined
in
the
laughter
all
right
durst
said
the
anderson
woman
has
a
lover
and
presents
no
danger
may
we
proceed
he
turned
to
dr
glover
who
immediately
grew
sober
have
we
identified
all
the
families
glover
nodded
four
hundred
and
twelve
of
them
all
steady
customers
of
miles
very
well
let
s
shoot
for
the
twenty
fifth
he
raised
inquiring
eyebrows
at
trumbull
everything
set
at
the
dairy
trumbull
nodded
yep
come
d
day
carl
and
i
will
be
handling
the
zeta
at
the
bottling
plant
it
s
a
go
frank
durst
stared
into
space
as
if
unreeling
a
familiar
movie
in
his
mind
then
stood
up
and
reached
four
glasses
of
scotch
dropping
two
ice
cubes
into
one
of
them
on
the
rocks
if
i
remember
correctly
doctor
glover
winked
and
accepted
the
drink
along
with
the
others
one
reminder
durst
said
except
for
miles
and
the
doctor
s
necessary
visits
to
the
hospital
no
one
leaves
dalton
understood
he
looked
about
saw
no
disagreement
and
broke
into
an
uncharacteristic
smile
which
soon
faded
he
raised
his
glass
as
the
rest
shuffled
to
their
feet
gentlemen
he
said
i
give
you
operation
crucible
operation
crucible
they
intoned
the
director
pushed
a
pile
of
papers
aside
and
from
behind
his
surprisingly
messy
desk
decorated
with
the
memorabilia
of
three
wars
and
six
administrations
assessed
harcourt
you
look
distraught
bad
news
i
m
afraid
waved
to
a
chair
he
sat
ramrod
stiff
across
the
desk
from
his
superior
hands
in
lap
buttoned
what
is
it
the
beshlenkov
affair
we
ve
failed
not
only
that
but
beshlenkov
is
dead
for
the
first
time
in
the
twenty
six
years
they
had
worked
together
harcourt
extracted
a
marked
reaction
from
the
director
the
granite
face
went
ashen
tell
me
about
it
do
not
omit
a
single
detail
twenty
minutes
later
he
looked
across
the
desk
is
that
all
of
it
yes
sir
let
me
say
now
that
rainbow
is
beyond
argument
our
finest
agent
and
pedestrian
is
not
far
behind
considering
his
age
i
consider
them
faultless
in
the
entire
affair
the
director
waved
his
hand
as
if
chasing
away
a
bothersome
insect
yes
yes
of
course
he
thought
a
moment
then
murmured
an
experiment
in
an
american
city
that
s
it
then
they
have
zeta
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
be
a
success
he
leaned
forward
my
god
harcourt
my
god
we
re
years
behind
them
on
this
harcourt
waited
a
respectable
length
of
time
before
raising
the
your
pockets
was
a
slip
