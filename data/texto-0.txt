was
only
by
retrospect
you
could
be
made
aware
of
the
amazing
variety
of
ideas
that
had
been
presented
mr
clare
certainly
found
few
men
in
this
remote
situation
that
were
capable
of
participating
in
his
ideas
and
amusements
it
has
been
among
the
weaknesses
of
great
men
to
fly
to
solitude
and
converse
with
woods
and
groves
rather
than
with
a
circle
of
strong
and
comprehensive
minds
like
their
own
from
the
moment
of
mr
falkland
s
arrival
in
the
neighbourhood
mr
clare
distinguished
him
in
the
most
flattering
manner
to
so
penetrating
a
genius
there
was
no
need
of
long
experience
and
patient
observation
to
discover
the
merits
and
defects
of
any
character
that
presented
itself
the
materials
of
his
judgment
had
long
since
been
accumulated
and
at
the
close
of
so
illustrious
a
life
he
might
almost
be
said
to
see
through
nature
at
a
glance
what
wonder
that
he
took
some
interest
in
a
mind
in
a
certain
degree
congenial
with
his
own
but
to
mr
tyrrel
s
diseased
imagination
every
distinction
bestowed
on
his
neighbour
seemed
to
be
expressly
intended
as
an
insult
to
him
on
the
other
hand
mr
clare
though
gentle
and
benevolent
in
his
remonstrances
to
a
degree
that
made
the
taking
offence
impossible
was
by
no
means
parsimonious
of
praise
or
slow
to
make
use
of
the
deference
that
was
paid
him
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
justice
to
merit
it
happened
at
one
of
those
public
meetings
at
which
mr
falkland
and
mr
tyrrel
were
present
that
the
conversation
in
one
of
the
most
numerous
sets
into
which
the
company
was
broken
turned
upon
the
poetical
talents
of
the
former
a
lady
who
was
present
and
was
distinguished
for
the
acuteness
of
her
understanding
said
she
had
been
favoured
with
a
sight
of
a
poem
he
had
just
written
entitled
an
ode
to
the
genius
of
chivalry
which
appeared
to
her
of
exquisite
merit
the
curiosity
of
the
company
was
immediately
excited
and
the
lady
added
she
had
a
copy
in
her
pocket
which
was
much
at
their
service
provided
its
being
thus
produced
would
not
be
disagreeable
to
the
author
the
whole
circle
immediately
entreated
mr
falkland
to
comply
with
their
wishes
and
mr
clare
who
was
one
of
the
company
enforced
their
petition
nothing
gave
this
gentleman
so
much
pleasure
as
to
have
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
and
doing
justice
to
the
exhibition
of
intellectual
excellence
mr
falkland
had
no
false
modesty
or
affectation
and
therefore
readily
yielded
his
consent
mr
tyrrel
accidentally
sat
at
the
extremity
of
this
circle
it
cannot
be
supposed
that
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
was
by
any
means
agreeable
to
him
he
appeared
to
wish
to
withdraw
himself
but
there
seemed
to
be
some
unknown
power
that
as
it
were
by
enchantment
retained
him
in
his
place
and
made
him
consent
to
drink
to
the
dregs
the
bitter
potion
which
envy
had
prepared
for
him
the
poem
was
read
to
the
rest
of
the
company
by
mr
clare
whose
elocution
was
scarcely
inferior
to
his
other
accomplishments
simplicity
discrimination
and
energy
constantly
attended
him
in
the
act
of
reading
and
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
a
more
refined
delight
than
fell
to
the
lot
of
those
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
his
auditors
the
beauties
of
mr
falkland
s
poem
were
accordingly
exhibited
with
every
advantage
the
successive
passions
of
the
author
were
communicated
to
the
hearer
what
was
impetuous
and
what
was
solemn
were
delivered
with
a
responsive
feeling
and
a
flowing
and
unlaboured
tone
the
pictures
conjured
up
by
the
creative
fancy
of
the
poet
were
placed
full
to
view
at
one
time
overwhelming
the
soul
with
superstitious
awe
and
at
another
transporting
it
with
luxuriant
beauty
the
character
of
the
hearers
upon
this
occasion
has
already
been
described
they
were
for
the
most
part
plain
unlettered
and
of
little
refinement
poetry
in
general
they
read
when
read
at
all
from
the
mere
force
of
imitation
and
with
few
sensations
of
pleasure
but
this
poem
had
a
peculiar
vein
of
glowing
inspiration
this
very
poem
would
probably
have
been
seen
by
many
of
them
with
little
effect
but
the
accents
of
mr
clare
carried
it
home
to
the
heart
he
ended
and
as
the
countenances
of
his
auditors
had
before
sympathised
with
the
passions
of
the
composition
so
now
they
emulated
each
other
in
declaring
their
approbation
their
sensations
were
of
a
sort
to
which
they
were
little
accustomed
one
spoke
and
another
followed
by
a
sort
of
uncontrollable
impulse
and
the
rude
and
broken
manner
of
their
commendations
rendered
them
the
more
singular
and
remarkable
but
what
was
least
to
be
endured
was
the
behaviour
of
mr
clare
he
returned
the
manuscript
to
the
lady
from
whom
he
had
received
it
and
then
addressing
mr
falkland
said
with
emphasis
and
animation
ha
this
is
as
it
should
be
it
is
of
the
right
stamp
i
have
seen
too
many
hard
essays
strained
from
the
labour
of
a
pedant
and
pastoral
ditties
distressed
in
lack
of
a
meaning
they
are
such
as
you
sir
that
we
want
do
not
forget
however
that
the
muse
was
not
given
to
add
refinements
to
idleness
but
for
the
highest
and
most
invaluable
purposes
act
up
to
the
magnitude
of
your
destiny
a
moment
after
mr
clare
quitted
his
seat
and
with
mr
falkland
and
two
or
three
more
withdrew
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
mr
tyrrel
edged
further
into
the
circle
he
had
sat
silent
so
long
that
he
seemed
ready
to
burst
with
gall
and
indignation
mighty
pretty
verses
said
he
half
talking
to
himself
and
not
addressing
any
particular
person
why
ay
the
verses
are
well
enough
damnation
i
should
like
to
know
what
a
ship
load
of
such
stuff
is
good
for
why
surely
said
the
lady
who
had
introduced
mr
falkland
s
ode
on
the
present
occasion
you
must
allow
that
poetry
is
an
he
immediately
penetrated
the
cause
and
observed
that
my
very
countenance
told
him
he
was
no
longer
a
welcome
guest
to
me
i
asked
him
if
he
ought
so
to
be
since
his
motives
for
seeking
admission
were
unworthy
of
being
communicated
to
my
friends
that
he
said
was
not
the
case
but
that
prudence
in
the
present
instance
required
a
temporary
concealment
he
then
undertook
to
exculpate
himself
from
blame
assuring
me
that
as
soon
as
i
should
discountenance
the
expectations
of
mr
boyer
and
discontinue
the
reception
of
his
address
his
intentions
should
be
made
known
he
was
enlarging
upon
this
topic
when
we
heard
a
footstep
approaching
us
and
looking
up
saw
mr
boyer
within
a
few
paces
of
the
arbor
confusion
seized
us
both
we
rose
involuntarily
from
our
seats
but
were
mute
as
statues
he
spoke
not
a
word
but
casting
a
look
of
indignant
accusation
at
me
a
glance
which
penetrated
my
very
soul
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
hastily
back
to
the
house
i
stood
a
few
moments
considering
what
course
to
take
though
shame
and
regret
had
almost
taken
from
me
the
power
of
thought
major
sanford
took
my
hand
i
withdrew
it
from
him
i
must
leave
you
said
i
where
will
you
go
said
he
i
will
go
and
try
to
retrieve
my
character
it
has
suffered
greatly
by
this
fatal
interview
he
threw
himself
at
my
feet
and
exclaimed
leave
me
not
eliza
i
conjure
you
not
to
leave
me
let
me
go
now
i
rejoined
or
i
bid
you
farewell
forever
i
flew
precipitately
by
him
and
went
into
the
parlor
where
i
found
mr
boyer
and
my
mamma
the
one
traversing
the
room
in
the
greatest
agitation
the
other
in
a
flood
of
tears
their
appearance
affected
me
and
i
wept
like
an
infant
when
i
had
a
little
recovered
myself
i
begged
him
to
sit
down
he
answered
no
i
then
told
him
that
however
unjustifiable
my
conduct
might
appear
perhaps
i
might
explain
it
to
his
satisfaction
if
he
would
hear
me
that
my
motives
were
innocent
though
they
doubtless
wore
the
aspect
of
criminality
in
his
view
he
sternly
replied
that
no
palliation
could
avail
that
my
motives
were
sufficiently
notorious
he
accused
me
of
treating
him
ill
of
rendering
him
the
dupe
of
coquetting
artifice
of
having
an
intrigue
with
major
sanford
and
declared
his
determination
to
leave
me
forever
as
unworthy
of
his
regard
and
incapable
of
love
gratitude
or
honor
there
was
too
much
reason
in
support
of
his
accusations
for
me
to
gainsay
them
had
his
impetuosity
suffered
me
to
attempt
it
but
in
truth
i
had
no
inclination
to
self
defence
my
natural
vivacity
had
forsaken
me
and
i
listened
without
interrupting
him
to
the
fluency
of
reproachful
language
which
his
resentment
inspired
he
took
a
very
solemn
and
affectionate
leave
of
my
mamma
thanking
her
for
her
politeness
and
wishing
her
much
future
felicity
he
attempted
to
address
me
i
suppose
somewhat
in
the
same
way
but
his
sensibility
somewhat
overcame
him
and
he
only
took
my
hand
and
bowing
in
silence
departed
the
want
of
rest
for
two
long
nights
together
the
exercise
of
mind
and
conflict
of
passions
which
now
tortured
my
breast
were
too
much
for
me
to
support
when
i
saw
that
he
was
gone
that
he
had
actually
forsaken
me
i
fainted
my
mamma
with
the
assistance
of
the
maid
soon
restored
me
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
beheld
this
amiable
and
tender
parent
watching
and
attending
me
with
the
most
anxious
concern
without
one
reproachful
word
without
one
accusing
look
my
reflections
upon
the
part
i
had
acted
in
defeating
her
benevolent
wishes
were
exquisitely
afflictive
but
we
mutually
forbore
to
mention
the
occasion
of
my
illness
and
i
complied
with
her
advice
to
take
some
refreshment
and
retire
to
my
chamber
i
am
so
much
fatigued
by
the
exertions
of
the
day
that
rest
is
absolutely
necessary
and
i
lay
aside
my
pen
to
seek
it
friday
morning
when
i
shall
again
receive
the
balmy
influence
of
sleep
i
know
not
it
has
absolutely
forsaken
me
at
present
i
have
had
a
most
restless
night
every
awakening
idea
presented
itself
to
my
imagination
whether
i
had
sustained
a
real
loss
in
mr
boyer
s
departure
reflections
on
my
own
misconduct
with
the
censure
of
my
friends
and
the
ill
natured
remarks
of
my
enemies
excited
the
most
painful
anxiety
in
my
mind
i
am
going
down
but
how
shall
i
see
my
mamma
to
her
i
will
confess
my
faults
in
her
maternal
breast
repose
my
cares
and
by
her
friendly
advice
regulate
my
conduct
had
i
done
this
before
i
might
have
escaped
this
trouble
and
saved
both
her
and
myself
many
distressing
emotions
friday
evening
i
have
had
a
long
conversation
with
my
mamma
which
has
greatly
relieved
my
mind
she
has
soothed
me
with
the
most
endearing
tenderness
mr
atkins
with
whom
mr
boyer
lodged
while
in
town
called
here
this
afternoon
i
did
not
see
him
but
he
told
my
mamma
that
mr
boyer
had
returned
home
and
left
a
letter
for
me
which
he
had
promised
to
convey
with
his
own
hand
by
this
i
am
convinced
that
the
die
is
absolutely
cast
with
respect
to
him
and
that
no
attempts
on
my
part
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
would
be
either
prudent
or
successful
he
has
penetrated
the
cause
of
my
proceedings
and
such
is
his
resentment
that
i
am
inclined
not
much
to
regret
his
avoiding
another
interview
my
excuses
would
be
deemed
utterly
insufficient
and
truth
would
not
befriend
and
justify
me
as
i
know
you
are
impatient
to
hear
from
me
i
will
now
despatch
this
long
letter
without
any
other
addition
than
that
i
am
your
sincere
friend
eliza
wharton
letter
xlii
to
mr
charles
deighton
hartford
well
charles
the
show
is
over
as
we
yankees
say
and
the
time
to
be
visible
only
by
fits
this
token
of
approaching
land
affected
me
as
much
as
if
i
had
reached
the
threshhold
of
my
friend
s
dwelling
at
length
we
entered
the
port
and
i
viewed
with
high
raised
but
inexplicable
feelings
objects
with
which
i
had
been
from
infancy
familiar
the
flag
staff
erected
on
the
battery
recalled
to
my
imagination
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
and
morning
walks
which
i
had
taken
on
that
spot
with
the
lost
constantia
the
dream
was
fondly
cherished
that
the
figure
which
i
saw
loitering
along
the
terrace
was
her
s
on
disembarking
i
gazed
at
every
female
passenger
in
hope
that
it
was
she
whom
i
sought
an
absence
of
three
years
had
obliterated
from
my
memory
none
of
the
images
which
attended
me
on
my
departure
chapter
xxiv
after
a
night
of
repose
rather
than
of
sleep
i
began
the
search
after
my
friend
i
went
to
the
house
which
the
dudleys
formerly
inhabited
and
which
had
been
the
asylum
of
my
infancy
it
was
now
occupied
by
strangers
by
whom
no
account
could
be
given
of
its
former
tenants
i
obtained
directions
to
the
owner
of
the
house
he
was
equally
unable
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
the
purchase
had
been
made
at
a
public
sale
and
terms
had
been
settled
not
with
dudley
but
with
the
sheriff
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
history
of
craig
s
imposture
and
its
consequences
were
confirmed
by
every
one
who
resided
at
that
period
in
new
york
the
dudleys
were
well
remembered
and
their
disappearance
immediately
after
their
fall
had
been
generally
noticed
but
whither
they
had
retired
was
a
problem
which
no
one
was
able
to
solve
this
evasion
was
strange
by
what
motives
the
dudleys
were
induced
to
change
their
ancient
abode
could
be
vaguely
guessed
my
friend
s
grandfather
was
a
native
of
the
west
indies
descendants
of
the
same
stock
still
resided
in
tobago
they
might
be
affluent
and
to
them
it
was
possible
that
mr
dudley
in
this
change
of
fortune
had
betaken
himself
for
relief
this
was
a
mournful
expedient
since
it
would
raise
a
barrier
between
my
friend
and
myself
scarcely
to
be
surmounted
constantia
s
mother
was
stolen
by
mr
dudley
from
a
convent
at
amiens
there
were
no
affinities
therefore
to
draw
them
to
france
her
grandmother
was
a
native
of
baltimore
of
a
family
of
some
note
by
name
ridgeley
this
family
might
still
exist
and
have
either
afforded
an
asylum
to
the
dudleys
or
at
least
be
apprised
of
their
destiny
it
was
obvious
to
conclude
that
they
no
longer
existed
within
the
precincts
of
new
york
a
journey
to
baltimore
was
the
next
expedient
this
journey
was
made
in
the
depth
of
winter
and
by
the
speediest
conveyance
i
made
no
more
than
a
day
s
sojourn
in
philadelphia
the
epidemic
by
which
that
city
had
been
lately
ravaged
i
had
not
heard
of
till
my
arrival
in
america
its
devastations
were
then
painted
to
my
fancy
in
the
most
formidable
colours
a
few
months
only
had
elapsed
since
its
extinction
and
i
expected
to
see
numerous
marks
of
misery
and
dispopulation
to
my
no
small
surprize
however
no
vestiges
of
this
calamity
were
to
be
discerned
all
houses
were
open
all
streets
thronged
and
all
faces
thoughtless
or
busy
the
arts
and
the
amusements
of
life
seemed
as
sedulously
cultivated
as
ever
little
did
i
then
think
what
had
been
and
what
at
that
moment
was
the
condition
of
my
friend
i
stopt
for
the
sake
of
respite
from
fatigue
and
did
not
therefore
pass
much
time
in
the
streets
perhaps
had
i
walked
seasonably
abroad
we
might
have
encountered
each
other
and
thus
have
saved
ourselves
from
a
thousand
anxieties
at
baltimore
i
made
myself
known
without
the
formality
of
introduction
to
the
ridgeleys
they
acknowledged
their
relationship
to
mr
dudley
but
professed
absolute
ignorance
of
his
fate
indirect
intercourse
only
had
been
maintained
formerly
by
dudley
with
his
mother
s
kindred
they
had
heard
of
his
misfortune
a
twelvemonth
after
it
happened
but
what
measures
had
been
subsequently
pursued
their
kinsman
had
not
thought
proper
to
inform
them
the
failure
of
this
expedient
almost
bereft
me
of
hope
neither
my
own
imagination
nor
the
ridgeleys
could
suggest
any
new
mode
by
which
my
purpose
was
likely
to
be
accomplished
to
leave
america
without
obtaining
the
end
of
my
visit
could
not
be
thought
of
without
agony
and
yet
the
continuance
of
my
stay
promised
me
no
relief
from
my
uncertainties
on
this
theme
i
ruminated
without
ceasing
i
recalled
every
conversation
and
incident
of
former
times
and
sought
in
them
a
clue
by
which
my
present
conjectures
might
be
guided
one
night
immersed
alone
in
my
chamber
my
thoughts
were
thus
employed
my
train
of
meditation
was
on
this
occasion
new
from
the
review
of
particulars
from
which
no
satisfaction
had
hitherto
been
gained
i
passed
to
a
vague
and
comprehensive
retrospect
mr
dudley
s
early
life
his
profession
of
a
painter
his
zeal
in
this
pursuit
and
his
reluctance
to
quit
it
were
remembered
would
he
not
revert
to
this
profession
when
other
means
of
subsistence
were
gone
it
is
true
similar
obstacles
with
those
which
had
formerly
occasioned
his
resort
to
a
different
path
existed
at
present
and
no
painter
of
his
name
was
to
be
found
in
philadelphia
baltimore
or
new
york
but
would
it
not
occur
to
him
that
the
patronage
denied
to
his
skill
by
the
frugal
and
unpolished
habits
of
his
countrymen
might
with
more
probability
of
success
be
sought
from
the
opulence
and
luxury
of
london
nay
had
he
not
once
affirmed
in
my
hearing
that
if
he
ever
were
reduced
to
poverty
this
was
the
method
he
would
pursue
this
conjecture
was
too
bewitching
to
be
easily
dismissed
every
new
reflection
augmented
its
force
i
was
suddenly
raised
by
it
from
the
deepest
melancholy
to
the
region
taken
it
for
a
knob
on
the
bark
of
the
tree
all
three
now
returned
to
watch
the
manoeuvres
of
the
birds
that
not
having
seen
them
by
the
nest
still
continued
playing
among
the
flowers
the
boys
stole
as
near
as
possible
keeping
behind
a
large
bunch
of
hanging
vines
lucien
was
nearest
and
his
face
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
little
creatures
so
that
he
could
observe
every
motion
they
made
he
was
soon
gratified
with
a
sight
that
determined
his
point
for
him
a
swarm
of
small
blue
winged
flies
attracted
his
attention
they
were
among
the
blossoms
sometimes
resting
upon
them
and
sometimes
flitting
about
from
one
to
another
he
saw
the
birds
several
times
dash
at
them
with
open
bills
and
pick
them
from
their
perch
so
the
question
was
decided
the
humming
birds
were
insect
eaters
after
a
while
the
female
flew
off
to
her
nest
leaving
the
male
still
among
the
flowers
the
curiosity
of
the
boys
was
now
satisfied
and
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
tent
when
lucien
suddenly
made
a
motion
whispering
the
others
to
remain
silent
francois
first
caught
sight
of
the
object
which
had
caused
this
behaviour
on
the
part
of
his
brother
and
then
basil
saw
it
a
hideous
object
it
was
crouching
among
the
leaves
now
crawling
sideways
now
making
short
springs
and
then
hiding
itself
went
a
fearful
looking
creature
it
was
about
the
size
of
one
of
the
birds
but
far
different
in
appearance
its
body
consisted
of
two
pieces
joined
about
the
middle
and
covered
all
over
with
a
reddish
brown
wool
or
hair
that
stood
upright
like
bristles
it
had
ten
limbs
long
crooked
and
covered
with
hair
like
the
body
two
curved
claw
like
antennae
or
feelers
in
front
and
two
horns
projecting
behind
so
that
but
for
the
sharp
fiery
eyes
of
the
creature
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
tell
its
head
from
its
hinder
part
its
rusty
colour
its
ill
shaped
body
and
hairy
legs
combined
with
the
piercing
look
from
its
eyes
gave
it
a
most
vicious
appearance
such
as
belongs
less
or
more
to
all
of
its
race
for
it
was
of
the
race
aranea
or
spiders
the
leaping
tarantula
whispered
lucien
to
his
brothers
see
he
continued
it
is
after
the
ruby
throat
this
was
evident
step
by
step
and
leap
after
leap
it
was
approaching
the
cluster
of
blossoms
where
the
humming
bird
was
at
the
moment
engaged
its
eyes
were
bent
eagerly
upon
the
latter
and
whenever
it
flew
up
from
the
flowers
and
whirred
idly
about
the
tarantula
squatted
itself
closely
hiding
behind
the
leaves
or
shanks
of
the
vines
on
the
other
hand
when
the
bird
settled
a
moment
and
appeared
busily
feeding
the
skulking
creature
would
advance
a
stage
nearer
either
by
a
quick
run
or
a
leap
when
it
would
again
conceal
itself
and
await
a
fresh
opportunity
as
the
bird
flitted
about
a
good
deal
the
spider
had
frequently
to
change
its
direction
in
following
the
former
after
one
of
its
short
flights
settled
into
a
pet
flower
directly
in
front
of
where
the
latter
lay
crouching
it
did
not
enter
the
cup
of
the
flower
but
remained
at
the
mouth
poised
upon
its
whirring
wings
while
with
its
long
prehensile
tongue
it
drew
out
the
honey
it
had
scarcely
been
a
moment
in
this
position
when
the
tarantula
sprang
forward
and
clutched
it
round
the
body
with
his
antennae
the
bird
with
a
wild
chirrup
like
that
of
a
distressed
cricket
flew
outward
and
upwards
its
wings
were
still
free
and
all
expected
it
would
carry
off
the
spider
that
was
now
seen
clinging
around
it
not
so
however
on
getting
a
few
feet
from
the
flower
its
flight
appeared
to
be
suddenly
checked
and
although
it
still
kept
in
the
air
flying
first
one
way
and
then
another
it
was
evident
that
something
restrained
it
from
getting
clear
off
on
looking
more
attentively
a
fine
silk
like
line
was
seen
stretching
from
the
trees
to
the
fluttering
creature
it
was
the
thread
of
the
spider
and
this
it
was
that
prevented
his
victim
from
carrying
him
into
the
air
the
little
wings
soon
ceased
to
move
and
both
bird
and
spider
fell
to
the
end
of
the
thread
where
they
hung
for
a
moment
suspended
the
boys
could
see
that
the
bird
was
dead
and
the
mandibles
of
the
tarantula
were
buried
in
its
shining
threat
francois
would
have
rushed
forward
to
kill
the
destroyer
but
lucien
who
was
too
ardent
a
naturalist
to
have
his
lesson
thus
interrupted
restrained
his
more
impetuous
brother
and
all
three
remained
quiet
as
before
the
tarantula
now
commenced
reeling
in
his
line
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
his
prey
up
among
the
branches
where
he
had
his
nest
the
boys
looked
upward
to
discover
the
latter
there
sure
enough
was
the
web
in
a
shaded
corner
stretching
its
meshes
from
a
large
liana
to
the
trunk
of
the
tupelo
and
towards
this
point
the
spider
now
slowly
progressed
with
his
lifeless
victim
as
they
watched
his
motions
their
eyes
were
caught
by
a
shining
object
that
moved
along
the
wrinkled
bark
of
the
liana
as
the
vine
was
nearly
a
foot
in
diameter
and
of
a
deep
ferruginous
colour
this
object
was
the
more
apparent
against
its
dark
ground
for
it
was
a
creature
of
brilliant
hues
it
was
an
animal
of
the
lizard
species
and
if
any
lizard
could
be
considered
beautiful
this
one
might
have
been
so
called
but
the
hideous
half
human
form
of
these
animals
their
piercing
looks
their
stealthy
and
predatory
habits
and
above
all
the
knowledge
that
the
bite
of
several
of
their
species
is
poisonous
combine
to
render
them
objects
that
excite
disgust
and
awe
rather
than
admiration
this
one
as
we
have
already
said
was
of
the
most
brilliant
colour
the
whole
of
its
upper
surface
was
a
mr
sheldon
laughed
at
first
at
the
whim
she
had
conceived
and
endeavoured
to
rally
her
out
of
it
but
finding
that
it
was
to
her
a
matter
of
serious
importance
and
thinking
there
could
be
neither
harm
nor
impropriety
in
granting
her
request
he
acceded
to
her
wishes
and
she
was
ever
after
called
dorcasina
about
two
years
after
this
a
circumstance
happened
which
formed
an
important
era
in
the
life
of
miss
dorcasina
mr
sheldon
one
day
received
a
letter
from
an
old
esteemed
friend
in
virginia
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
fifteen
years
informing
him
of
his
intention
of
making
him
a
visit
adding
that
he
should
bring
with
him
his
only
son
the
stay
and
prop
of
his
declining
age
and
the
darling
of
his
fondest
affections
lysander
by
which
name
we
shall
cull
the
young
gentlemen
was
about
twenty
five
his
person
was
noble
and
commanding
his
countenance
open
and
liberal
and
his
address
manly
and
pleasing
his
understanding
was
rather
solid
than
brilliant
and
much
improved
by
education
and
travel
his
ideas
of
domestic
happiness
were
just
and
rational
and
he
judged
from
what
he
had
observed
that
an
agreeable
matrimonial
connexion
was
much
the
happiest
state
in
life
he
therefore
wished
to
marry
but
there
happened
to
be
no
lady
in
the
circle
of
his
acquaintance
who
perfectly
both
satisfied
his
judgment
and
pleased
his
fancy
miss
dorcasina
on
perusing
the
letter
handed
by
her
father
thought
the
time
wag
now
come
when
she
should
experience
the
sweet
satisfaction
of
loving
and
being
loved
the
similarity
of
their
circumstances
lysander
am
only
son
and
she
an
only
daughter
the
old
gentleman
s
coming
so
far
to
see
her
father
his
never
having
done
it
before
and
his
bringing
his
son
with
him
all
served
to
confirm
her
in
the
opinion
that
he
was
the
person
decreed
by
the
stars
to
become
her
husband
she
would
to
be
sure
have
been
better
pleased
had
their
acquaintance
commenced
in
a
more
romantic
manner
she
wished
that
in
passing
by
his
carriage
had
broken
down
and
he
had
been
brought
in
wounded
or
that
he
had
accidentally
met
her
scouring
the
woods
on
horseback
an
amusement
in
which
she
took
great
delight
and
that
her
horse
being
unruly
he
had
arrived
just
in
time
to
save
her
from
falling
or
which
would
have
been
still
more
to
her
taste
that
some
resolute
fellow
in
love
with
her
to
distraction
but
who
had
made
no
impression
on
her
heart
had
carried
her
off
by
force
to
marry
her
and
that
lysander
had
rescued
her
by
his
gallantry
and
conveyed
her
back
in
safety
to
the
arms
of
her
distressed
parent
but
as
none
of
these
romantic
adventures
with
which
she
had
been
so
delighted
in
novels
had
ever
happened
to
her
she
thought
she
must
be
satisfied
if
at
their
first
interview
he
beheld
her
with
raptures
of
delight
and
of
this
she
entertained
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
the
night
previous
to
the
day
on
which
with
alternate
emotions
of
hope
fear
and
pleasure
she
expected
the
arrival
of
lysander
she
returned
at
her
usual
hour
to
her
chamber
attended
by
a
female
domestic
who
having
been
brought
up
in
the
family
from
seven
years
old
had
become
her
confidante
and
favourite
this
she
considered
indispensible
for
it
would
have
been
entirely
out
of
character
and
setting
aside
a
most
essential
circumstance
in
the
life
of
a
heroine
not
to
have
had
either
a
friend
to
whom
she
could
confide
the
secret
of
her
love
or
a
maid
who
could
be
bribed
by
an
enamorato
to
place
a
letter
in
her
way
and
then
confidentially
assert
that
she
knew
not
from
whence
it
came
both
these
characters
are
frequently
united
in
the
same
person
as
was
the
case
in
the
present
instance
for
there
being
no
female
among
her
acquaintance
in
the
neighbourhood
whose
notions
of
love
were
so
refined
or
if
you
please
so
romantic
as
were
those
of
miss
dorcnsina
she
declined
all
intimacy
with
them
and
preferred
betty
to
the
double
capacity
of
servant
and
confidante
betty
was
a
few
years
older
than
her
mistress
she
was
a
good
hearted
honest
creature
possessed
of
a
tolerably
good
natural
understanding
but
very
ignorant
and
extremely
superstitious
after
dorcasina
had
disposed
herself
in
bed
she
requested
betty
to
sit
down
by
her
bedside
saying
she
had
something
of
consequence
to
communicate
betty
having
seated
herself
in
an
attentive
posture
dorcasiha
began
by
informing
her
that
it
was
impressed
on
her
mind
that
she
and
the
young
gentleman
who
was
next
day
expected
should
at
first
sight
fall
violently
in
love
with
each
other
and
that
she
had
not
the
least
doubt
but
he
was
the
person
destined
by
heaven
to
become
her
husband
betty
remaining
silent
for
indeed
she
was
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
dorcasina
thus
continued
though
i
know
that
love
is
stronger
than
death
and
that
with
a
beloved
object
a
person
may
be
happy
on
the
top
of
the
alleganies
or
among
the
snows
of
greenland
yet
i
must
confess
i
shall
feel
a
sensible
pain
at
quitting
my
dear
and
affectionate
father
and
this
delightful
spot
where
i
have
passed
all
my
life
and
to
which
i
feel
the
strongest
attachment
but
what
gives
me
the
greatest
pain
is
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
live
in
virginia
he
served
by
slaves
arid
be
supported
by
the
sweat
toil
and
blood
of
that
unfortunate
and
miserable
part
of
mankind
perhaps
ma
am
said
betty
lysander
and
his
father
treat
their
slaves
well
and
they
live
comfortable
and
happy
comfortable
they
may
be
replied
dorcasina
but
slavery
and
happiness
are
in
my
opinion
totally
incompatible
disguise
thyself
as
thou
wilt
still
slavery
thou
art
a
bitter
pill
they
complain
of
the
idle
thievish
unfaithful
disposition
of
their
slaves
but
let
the
proprietors
in
their
turn
be
degraded
to
servitude

the
tardiness
of

him
on

road
with
a
description
of

and
leander
though
he
smiled
at
his
simplicity
could
not
but
admire
his
disinterested
generosity
and
warm
benevolence
these
were
qualities
of
the
heart
and
under
whatever
form
they
were
exhibited
were
worthy
of
admiration
the
carriage
at
length
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
leander
s
heart
bounded
with
expectation
as
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
in
a
moment
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
his
amelia
they
rushed
to
each
other
s
arms
and
those
who
have
felt
the
keen
rapture
of
a
safe
return
can
only
imagine
the
feelings
of
two
fond
hearts
glowing
with
undivided
affection
amelia
soon
recollected
herself
and
rapidly
withdrew
her
hand
what
dow

he
oh

eclaircissement
took
place
and
amelia
found
her
leander
unaltered
with
her
usual
ingenuousness
she
held
out
her
hand
assuring
him
that
with
it
she
gave
an
heart
undivided
he
seized
it
with
rapture
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
his
eyes
spoke
the
silent
language
of
his
soul
now
that
s
good
j
exclaimed
honest
tarpaulin
that
sets
better
on
tom
tarpaulin
s
stomach
than
the
best
can
of
grog
that
ever
he
drank
peggy
s
health
in
on
a
saturday
night
amelia
after
considerable
persuasion
made
her
friendly
entertainers
accept
of
a
few
trifling
presents
and
leander
enquired
how
he
should
reward
her
generous
protector
let
me
kiss
jenny
once
said
he
that
s
reward
enough
for
tom
tarpaulin
the
ludicrous
reward
was
bestowed
and
amelia
after
receiving
the
promise
of
an
early
visit
from
peggy
and
assuring
her
that
she
should
never
forget
her
kindness
bade
an
affectionate
adieu
to
the
cottagers
to
whom
she
had
become
really
attached
v
pleasure
and
pain
were
combined
in
her
emotions
as
she
drew
near
her
paternal
roof
leander
with
soothing
tenderness
cheered
her
desponding
spirits
by
representing
in
lively
colours
the
joy
of
her
parents
on
seeing
her
return
we
must
pass
over
in
silence
the
scene
of
their
interview
parental
and
filial
affection
were
expressed
in
that
dumb
eloquence
which
mocks
description
critics
have
laboured
much
to
demonstrate
the
impropriety
of
tears
of
joy
and
have
considered
the
sigh
of
rapture
as
contrary
to
the
order
of
nature
but
tell
me
ye
whom
the
speaking
tear
surprizes
if
when
nothing
meets
your
eye
but
scenes
of
bliss
from
what
source
does
this
speaking
tear
proceed
having
restored
amelia
to
the
arms
of
her
parents
leander
bowed
respectfully
to
stanhope
now
my
dear
sir
said
he
if
my
vindication
of
myself
has
been
satisfactory
may
i
still
presume
to
hope
that
you
will
part
with
this
inestimable
gem
so
recently
restored
to
your
possession
to
you
replied
stanhope
an
apology
is
due
i
have
been
too
precipitate
in
affixing
a
stigma
to
your
character
which
i
now
find
was
as
undeserved
as
disgraceful
no
apologies
interrupted
anderson
i
will
hear
none
permit
me
once
more
to
call
you
my
father
and
i
am
happy
my
son
my
son
said
stanhope
pressing
him
to
his
bosom
while
a
tear
trembled
in
his
eye
you
are
worthy
of
the
title
henceforth
leander
and
amelia
axe
both
my
children
he
then
took
a
hand
of
each
in
one
of
his
saying
your
hearts
have
been
long
united
i
now
join
your
hands
may
heaven
bless
the
union
leander
bowed
and
turning
to
amelia
now
my
dear
girl
said
he
i
am
completely
happy
the
study
of
my
future
life
shall
be
to
make
you
so
lorenzo
now
entered
mr
anderson
said
stanhope
suffer
me
to
present
my
on
lorenzo
i
recommend
mr
anderson
to
you
as
a
brother
as
the
brother
of
my
amelia
said
anderson
embracing
him
you
are
welcome
to
my
heart
acquaintance
will
no
doubt
secure
you
a
distinguished
place
in
my
affection
on
your
own
account
lorenzo
was
equally
surprized
and
pleased
at
the
return
of
leander
and
amelia
he
bad
just
returned
from
an
ineffectual
search
almost
in
despair
amelia
tenderly
apologised
for
the
unnecessary
pain
she
had
giren
a
beloved
brother
think
no
more
of
it
my
sister
said
lorenzo
all
is
now
restored
all
is
as
it
should
be
the
dewy
moisture
of
sensibility
beamed
on
amelia
s
ye
leander
observed
it
and
repeated
to
her
the
following
sonnet
the
same
keen
sense
that
barbs
the
pangs
te
part
paints
the
wild
rapture
when
return
draws
nigh
when
bosoms
beat
to
bliss

the
round
tear
sliding
down
impetuosity
of
a
torrent
might
indeed
be
overwhelmed
but
not
rent
asunder
three
days
intervened
and
the
lovers
had
no
interview
in
the
hour
of
misfortune
when
oppressed
with
a
multiplicity
of
thoughts
to
disburthen
the
mind
either
by
writing
or
conversation
gives
relief
to
pain
and
transquillity
to
the
unquiet
borne
down
with
sorrowing
reflections
ira
took
the
determination
of
communicating
his
thoughts
to
isabella
the
unfortunate
bride
was
sitting
heavy
melancholy
musing
twas
at
the
decline
of
day
the
parting
sun
shot
a
horizontal
beam
through
the
crimson
curtains
ira
entered
and
beheld
in
the
person
of
his
beloved
the
figure
of
patience
on
a
monument
as
described
by
shakespeare
smiling
at
grief
he
took
her
hand

looked
up

my
husband
my
brother
the
young
man
agitated
by
a
thousand
sensations
grew
gradually
composed
isabella
i
must
see
you
no
more
how
are
my
senses
bewildered
in
this
meeting
i
find
even
now
that
to
meet
your
eye
is
at
once
my
pleasure
and
my
perdition
why
do
i
suppress
my
feelings
why
check
the
tears
which
involuntarily
burst
from
my
eyes
peace
ira
peace
give
liberty
to
your
sensations
to
act
themselves
why
dam
up
the
streams
of
thy
tears
are
they
not
the
characteristicks
of
nature
to
designate
an
honest
heart
to
remain
in
your
presence
my
sister
my
wife
is
willingly
to
swim
into
the
vortex
of
destruction
i
have
imposed
upon
myself
a
resolve
therefore
to
see
you
no
more
convinced
that
absence
from
you
will
conduce
to
my
welfare
isabella
manifested
evident
symptoms
of
dislike
at
this
resolution
will
you
fly
and
suffer
me
to
sink
into
the
gulf
of
despair
for
never
more
shall
i
appear
in
the
world
if
uncomforted
uncountenanced
unsupported
by
you
no
matter
by
what
title
i
call
you
still
are
you

stay

my
staff

young
husband
imagined
he
proceeded
systematically
let
us
be
ruled
by
reason
in
all
distress
mankind
imbibe
consolation
from
two
sources
in
dissipation
is
sought
a
temporary
forgetfulness
but
experience
evinces
there
is
no
lethe
for
love
in
time
or
absence
we
trust
for
relief
but
how
vain
the
hope
of
future
repose
i
will
strike
a
blow
at
the
root
i
will
depart
with
all
imaginable
expedition
i
will
seek
redress
in
the
bosom
of
the
mercantile
world
busied
with
novelty
and
engaged
in
regular
pursuits
i
will
teach
my
mind
to
contemplate
other
objects
and
to
forget
the
image
of
isabella
which
has
so
long
possest
my
heart
and
obtruded
itself
into
every
action
of
my
life
perhaps
my
future
conduct
may
be
tinged
with
the
melancholy
of
this
adventure
i
will
yet
remember
you
with
respect
what
is
more
with
tenderness
a
new
era
is
commenced
in
the
history
of
my
life
i
am
no
more
what
i
was
hitherto
i
have
conceived
of
human
nature
a
character
which
it
is
a
duty
to
wear
now
i
read
them
as
they
are
and
feel
myself
a
better
man
a
better
citizen
though
less
philanthropick
regarding
myself
i
shall
be
rich
and
be
capacitated
to
fulfil
those
offices
of
tenderness
and
charity
which
i
have
heretofore
only
known
in
theory
for
one
favourable
circumstance
i
pay
my
gratitude
to
the
bounty
of
heaven
the
discovery
and
termination
of
an
unfortunate
passion
has
not
sunk
me
to
that
stupid
apathy
which
absorbs
the
senses
but
has
inspired
me
with
that
resolution
which
is
the
soul
of
action
doomed
to
look
on
you
only
in
the
light
and
to
call
you
only
by
the
appellation
of
sister
reminded
by
every
object
of
the
calamitous
event
of
our
loves
i
go
lorenzo
in
the
ardour
of
friendship
provides
my
passage
and
i
am
forthwith
to
embark
isabella
viewed
the
project
of
her
friend
with
pity
and
a
smile
which
indicated
her
contempt
of
its
practicability
your
forced
pretended
resolution
my
dear
ira
is
of
little
consequence
i
know
your
character
ira
better
than
you
know
it
yourself
honest
sincere
impetuous
yet
meek
and
candid
i
can
conceive
how
far
you
may
be
driven
by
the
strength
of
passion
how
far
deluded
by
the
well
intended
but
wrong
headed
advice
of
friendship
do
you
love
and
yet
think
to
forget
one
by
mixing
with
the
world
of
business
impossible
personal
presence
is
not
necessary
to
inspire
or
continue
love
we
love
those
whom
we
have
never
seen
or
from
whom
we
are
removed
by
absence
the
characters
of
the
great
and
the
good
picture
to
us
ideas
of
beauty
and
beauty
is
the
cause
of
love
how
are
we
struck
with
the
awful
virtue
of
a
brutus
or
a
cato
how
delighted
with
the
more
gentle
more
amiable
graces
of
a
scipio
how
do
we
exult
in
the
honest
heart
and
unambitious
mind
of
a
cincinnatus
a
la
fayette
and
a
washington
to
come
up
to
our
times
still
nearer
how
are
our
breasts
warmed
with
sympathetick
benevolence
at
the
name
of
howard
do
we
not
figure
to
ourselves
in
the
solemnity
of
sacred
anticipation
the
son
of
heaven
seated
at
the
right
of
the
throne
of
grace
extending
the
hand
of
welcome
to
the
disciple
of
charity
and
pronouncing
with
the
voice
of
applause
i
was
in
prison
and
you
came
unto
me
we
love
those
whom
we
have
not
seen
because
we
entertain
in
our
hearts
an
idea
of
beauty
caused
by
their
virtues
surely
therefore
if
you
are
possessed
of
such
an
idea
it
will
follow
you
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
haunted
continually
with
the
ideal
presence
of
the
beloved
object
you
will
change
your
climate
but
not
your
mind
remembering
me
is
the
retrospect
painful
matters
it
in
what
place
you
take
this
retrospect
better
be
here
though
surrounded
with
disappointment
and
solemn
thought
than
among
strangers
let
the
mind
be
employed
but
do
not
go
ira
perceived
in
the
argument
of
isabella
that
sublime
which
not
only
persuades
but
transports
he
owned
a
word
not
used
by
any
english
prose
writer
of
eminence
until
the
reign
of
george
the
third
nor
ever
introduced
into
a
serious
poem
until
adopted
by
cowper
a
word
which
if
we
may
judge
of
adjectives
as
we
do
of
men
by
their
associates
shows
the
baseness
of
its
origin
by
the
company
it
keeps
being
generally
coupled
with
fellow
a
term
i
conceive
of
no
respect
except
in
courts
and
colleges
englishmen
from
the
peer
to
the
peasant
cannot
converse
ten
minutes
without
introducing
this
pert
adjunct
the
english
do
not
however
use
it
in
the
same
sense
we
do
in
new
england
where
we
apply
it
to
personal
grace
and
call
a
trim
well
built
young
man
clever
which
signification
is
sanctioned
by
bailey
s
and
the
elder
english
dictionaries
nor
do
they
use
it
in
our
secondary
sense
when
applying
it
to
the
qualities
of
the
mind
we
intend
by
it
good
humoured
they
use
it
to
signify
skilful
adroit
and
the
man
who
breaks
a
dwelling
house
a
prison
or
a
neck
adroitly
is
clever
i
heard
a
reverend
prebend
in
company
with
several
clergymen
of
the
episcopal
church
after
having
magnified
the
genius
of
the
prelate
pronounce
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
a
very
clever
fellow
a
native
of
england
may
be
distinguished
as
readily
by
the
frequent
use
of
the
adjective
clever
as
the
native
of
new
england
by
that
of
the
verb
guess
it
was
not
until
i
had
been
some
months
in
london
that
i
discovered
how
often
i
exposed
myself
to
ridicule
by
the
repeated
use
of
this
verb
my
new
friend
b
of
the
inner
temple
who
has
a
profound
knowledge
of
every
subject
but
the
law
as
he
is
one
of
those
assiduous
benchers
described
by
pope
who
pens
a
sonnet
when
he
should
engross
pointed
out
to
me
this
provincialism
as
he
styled
it
what
is
the
reason
he
inquired
that
you
new
englandmen
are
always
guessing
i
replied
coolly
because
we
imagine
it
makes
us
appear
very
clever
fellows
now
here
to
my
astonishment
b
was
in
the
same
predicament
as
myself
although
he
had
repeated
clever
and
clever
fellow
perhaps
twenty
times
in
this
interview
he
had
not
noticed
it
he
was
a
gentleman
of
too
refined
a
taste
to
advocate
this
alsatia
term
but
would
hardly
be
persuaded
of
its
exuberant
use
until
i
had
drawn
his
attention
to
it
in
conversation
with
several
of
his
countrymen
and
was
at
length
obliged
to
send
him
half
a
sheet
of
extracts
in
prose
and
verse
to
convince
him
of
its
absurd
recurrence
in
the
modern
english
fine
writing
but
b
is
really
a
clever
fellow
learned
and
candid
terms
seldom
united
by
a
london
copula
and
we
agreed
to
assist
each
other
in
devesting
our
style
of
these
silly
colloquisms
soon
after
b
said
to
me
with
earnestness
now
you
have
read
boswell
you
must
acknowledge
dr
johnson
to
have
been
a
very
clever
fellow
i
guess
he
was
i
replied
if
however
i
should
be
requested
to
note
some
shibboleth
to
distinguish
an
old
from
a
new
englandman
it
would
not
belike
the
israelites
in
pronunciation
nor
yet
in
expression
or
accent
not
in
words
but
in
mode
an
englishman
puts
and
answers
a
question
directly
a
new
englandman
puts
his
questions
circuitously
and
ways
answers
a
question
by
asking
another
i
am
indebted
in
some
measure
to
b
for
this
distinction
who
in
early
life
spent
a
winter
in
hartford
connecticut
but
which
your
own
observations
even
in
boston
will
abundantly
confirm
when
my
friend
the
templar
first
noticed
this
local
peculiarity
i
was
inclined
to
dispute
its
universality
among
us
b
offered
to
risk
the
decision
of
our
dispute
upon
the
reply
of
the
first
new
englandman
we
should
chance
to
accost
and
as
an
englishman
who
is
opposed
to
you
in
argument
always
has
abet
or
a
blow
at
your
service
he
offered
a
small
wager
that
he
would
propose
a
direct
question
to
him
and
the
yankey
should
reply
by
asking
another
we
were
strolling
in
st
james
s
park
and
who
should
approach
very
opportunely
butcharles
of
salem
after
the
first
salutations
b
said
pray
mr
what
time
of
the
day
is
it
by
your
watch
why
i
ca
nt
say
what
o
clock
is
it
by
yours
this
was
followed
by
a
hearty
laugh
but
when
the
affair
was
explained
to
charles
he
insisted
it
was
merely
fortuitous
and
might
not
happen
again
in
a
thousand
instances
and
finally
when
b
in
the
pride
of
victory
offered
to
double
the
bet
and
repeat
the
experiment
he
took
him
up
b
said
select
your
man
but
here
comes
your
countryman
dr
you
will
allow
him
to
be
as
correct
a
speaker
as
any
in
new
england
all
shall
be
fair
i
will
put
the
question
in
such
a
way
as
shall
preclude
the
possibility
of
his
being
taken
by
surprise
charles
acknowledged
dr
was
the
very
man
he
would
have
selected
the
doctor
by
this
time
joined
our
party
pray
doctor
said
b
very
deliberately
what
is
the
reason
you
new
englandmen
always
reply
to
a
question
by
asking
another
why
is
that
the
case
sir
as
you
are
a
very
clever
fellow
and
i
guess
you
are
wearied
by
this
time
i
will

my

my
excellent
friend
in

simple
country
whenever
you
hear
theft

mentioned
you
are
immediately
impressed
with
the
idea
of
some
low
fellow
stealing
a
horse

with
burroughs
issuing
his
canada
bank
bills
but
here
in
this
sublime
metropolis
where
every

carried
to
a

extreme
are
rogues

one
of
my
aunts
the
old
maid
who
was
my
protectress
at
the
old
mansion
you
have
seen
at
my
father
s
the
other
was
the
mother
of
alfred
she
married
very
young
to
a
gentleman
in
hartford
of
the
name
of
wilmot
who
fell
before
the
walls
of
louisburg
in
the
old
french
war
my
aunt
did
not
long
survive
him
her
health
which
had
been
for
some
time
declining
received
so
serious
a
shock
by
this
catastrophe
that
she
died
a
few
months
after
the
melancholy
tidings
arrived
leaving
alfred
their
only
child
then
an
infant
to
the
protection
of
his
relations
who
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
a
suitable
age
placed
him
at
school
my
grandfather
who
had
the
principal
management
of
mr
wilmot
s
estate
sent
my
uncle
who
was
then
young
and
unmarried
to
hartford
for
the
purpose
of
transacting
the
necessary
business
here
he
became
acquainted
with
a
young
lady
eminent
for
beauty
and
loveliness
but
without
fortune
the
daughter
of
a
poor
mechanic
as
soon
as
my
grandfather
was
informed
of
this
attachment
he
in
a
very
peremptory
manner
ordered
my
uncle
to
break
off
the
connection
on
pain
of
his
highest
displeasure
but
such
is
the
force
of
early
impressions
melissa
sighed
that
my
uncle
found
it
impossible
to
submit
to
these
firm
injunctions
a
clandestine
marriage
ensued
and
my
grandfather
s
maledictions
in
consequence
the
union
was
however
soon
dissolved
my
uncle
s
wife
died
in
about
twelve
months
after
their
marriage
and
soon
after
the
birth
of
the
first
child
which
was
a
daughter
inconsolable
and
comfortless
my
uncle
put
the
child
out
to
nurse
and
travelled
to
the
south
after
wandering
about
for
some
time
he
took
up
his
residence
in
charleston
where
he
amassed
a
splendid
fortune
he
finally
married
to
an
amiable
and
respectable
woman
whose
tenderness
though
it
did
not
entirely
remove
yet
greatly
alleviated
the
pangs
of
early
sorrow
and
this
added
to
the
little
blandishments
of
a
young
family
fixed
him
in
a
state
of
more
contentedness
than
he
once
ever
expected
to
see
his
daughter
by
his
first
wife
when
she
became
of
proper
age
was
sent
to
a
respectable
boarding
school
in
boston
where
she
remained
until
within
about
two
years
before
i
came
here
alfred
was
educated
at
harvard
college
as
soon
as
he
had
graduated
he
came
here
on
my
uncle
s
request
and
has
since
remained
in
his
family
soon
after
i
arrived
here
my
uncle
came
into
my
chamber
one
day
melissa
said
he
i
find
by
your
father
s
letters
that
he
considers
you
to
have
formed
an
improper
connection
i
wish
you
to
give
me
a
true
statement
of
the
matter
and
if
any
thing
can
be
done
to
reconcile
you
to
your
father
you
may
depend
upon
my
assistance
i
have
seen
some
troubles
in
this
way
myself
in
my
early
days
perhaps
my
counsel
may
be
of
some
service
i
immediately
gave
a
correct
account
of
every
particular
circumstance
from
the
time
of
my
first
acquaintance
with
you
until
my
arrival
at
this
house
he
sat
some
time
silent
and
then
told
me
that
my
father
he
believed
had
drawn
the
worst
side
of
the
picture
and
that
he
had
urged
him
to
exert
every
means
in
his
power
to
reclaim
me
to
obedience
that
beauman
was
to
follow
me
in
a
few
months
and
that
if
i
still
refused
to
yield
him
my
hand
my
father
positively
and
solemnly
declared
that
he
would
discard
me
forever
and
strenuously
enjoined
it
upon
him
to
do
the
same
i
well
know
my
brother
s
temper
continued
my
uncle
the
case
is
difficult
but
something
must
be
done
i
will
immediately
write
to
your
father
desiring
him
not
to
proceed
too
rashly
in
the
mean
time
we
must
consider
what
measures
to
pursue
you
must
not
my
niece
you
must
not
be
sacrificed
so
saying
he
left
me
highly
consoled
that
instead
of
a
tyrant
i
had
found
a
friend
in
my
new
protector
alfred
was
made
acquainted
with
the
affair
and
many
were
the
plans
projected
for
my
benefit
and
abandoned
as
indefeasible
till
an
event
happened
which
called
forth
all
the
fortitude
of
my
uncle
to
support
it
and
operated
in
the
end
to
free
me
from
persecution
my
uncle
s
daughter
by
his
first
wife
was
of
a
very
delicate
and
sickly
constitution
and
her
health
evidently
decreasing
after
she
came
to
this
place
she
was
sent
to
a
village
on
one
of
the
high
hills
of
pedee
where
she
remained
a
considerable
time
she
then
went
to
one
of
the
inland
towns
in
north
carolina
from
whence
she
had
but
just
returned
with
alfred
when
i
arrived
afterwards
i
accompanied
her
to
georgetown
and
other
places
attended
by
her
father
so
that
she
was
little
more
known
in
charleston
than
myself
but
all
answered
no
purpose
to
the
restoration
of
her
health
a
confirmed
hectic
carried
her
off
in
the
bloom
of
youth
i
was
but
a
few
months
older
than
she
her
name
was
melissa
a
name
which
a
pious
grandmother
had
borne
and
was
therefore
retained
in
the
family
our
similarity
of
age
and
in
some
measure
of
appearance
our
being
so
little
known
in
charleston
and
our
names
being
the
same
suggested
to
alfred
the
idea
of
imposing
on
my
father
by
passing
off
my
cousin
s
death
as
my
own
this
would
at
least
deter
beauman
from
prosecuting
his
intended
journey
to
charleston
it
would
also
give
time
for
farther
deliberation
and
might
so
operate
on
my
father
s
feelings
as
to
soften
that
obduracy
of
temper
which
deeply
disquieted
himself
and
others
and
thus
with
a
man
who
had
given
her
such
evident
proofs
of
indifference
and
selfishness
but
i
tremble
for
her
she
knows
not
the
world
into
which
she
is
about
to
plunge
open
sincere
and
without
disguise
herself
she
suspects
not
deceit
in
others
this
is
a
disposition
most
liable
to
imposition
of
any
in
the
world
and
where
joined
to
great
sensibility
is
the
source
of
undescribable
anguish
to
the
possessor
i
have
made
some
particular
inquiries
concerning
this
mrs
bellamy
with
whom
sarah
is
about
to
embark
for
an
another
kingdom
i
cannot
reconcile
the
idea
to
myself
that
a
tract
of
ocean
will
divide
us
that
in
distress
or
sickness
i
cannot
fly
to
her
that
contrary
winds
may
detain
her
letters
even
should
she
write
on
all
occasions
but
even
this
she
will
not
promise
i
will
inform
you
of
my
health
said
she
but
i
shall
not
plague
you
with
all
the
little
cross
incidents
which
may
occur
while
i
am
acting
in
my
double
capacity
of
humble
toad
eater
to
grandmamma
and
madam
governante
to
little
darling
you
flattered
me
in
your
last
with
the
hope
of
my
seeing
you
in
london
it
will
i
assure
you
be
a
very
high
gratification
but
as
you
mention
january
for
the
time
of
your
proposed
visit
i
fear
sarah
will
long
ere
that
have
been
the
inhabitant
of
our
sister
island
for
some
weeks
as
she
thinks
of
departing
the
latter
end
of
october
anne
letter
xx
sarah
to
anne
london
jan
a
most
delectable
voyage
and
journey
i
have
had
bad
weather
bad
accommodations
in
the
packet
bad
roads
and
bad
tempered
folks
to
deal
with
now
is
not
this
a
bad
beginning
well
there
is
an
old
adage
which
says
a
good
beginning
often
makes
a
bad
ending
and
why
not
vice
versa
we
were
six
days
crossing
the
channel
the
wind
blew
tempestuously
and
two
or
three
times
i
thought
we
should
have
been
obliged
to
revisit
the
coast
of
wales
whether
we
chose
it
or
not
and
that
not
in
the
pleasantest
manner
imaginable
however
here
we
are
all
difficulties
of
wind
and
weather
over
quietly
set
down
in
a
very
respectable
lodging
in
one
of
the
most
public
streets
in
dublin
this
mrs
bellamy
is
a
very
different
woman
on
this
side
st
george
s
channel
to
what
she
was
on
the
other
and
to
deal
plainly
had
i
known
as
much
before
i
left
england
as
i
do
now
i
should
never
have
thrown
myself
on
her
protection
but
as
i
am
here
i
will
remain
a
few
months
i
have
no
great
prediliction
for
another
voyage
though
ever
so
short
during
the
season
when
the
winds
let
loose
lash
the
mad
billows
until
they
foam
and
rise
threatening
even
heaven
itself
indeed
my
dear
there
is
no
scene
that
ever
i
witnessed
before
to
be
compared
to
the
sublimely
terrific
grandeur
of
a
storm
at
sea
the
horizon
contracted
by
the
black
impending
clouds
the
angry
scud
flitting
with
rapidity
through
the
sky
the
liquid
mountains
rising
to
the
topmast
heads
and
from
their
summit
pouring
with
tremendous
roar
the
white
torrent
that
as
it
falls
threatens
to
whelm
in
its
abyss
the
fragile
bark
as
the
gloom
of
night
approaches
to
see
on
the
leeward
quarter
the
black
coast
o
er
hung
with
precipices
and
fenced
around
with
rocks
over
which
the
rude
surge
incessant
breaks
to
hear
the
wind
howl
through
the
rigging
of
the
laboring
vessel
which
scarce
can
bear
the
smallest
spread
of
sail
then
to
reflect
that
perhaps
before
the
morn
returns
the
vessel
crew
all
all
may
be
enshrouded
in
a
watery
tomb
no
one
can
have
an
idea
of
the
sensation
that
must
at
such
a
period
prevade
the
mind
even
of
the
most
thoughtless
unless
they
have
themselves
been
present
at
such
a
scene
and
to
me
it
seems
an
impossibility
that
any
one
who
had
once
been
in
such
a
situation
could
ever
disbelieve
the
existence
of
a
god
great
wise
powerful
and
merciful
who
that
has
once
contemplated
his
wisdom
and
his
power
on
the
world
of
waters
would
wish
to
disbelieve
or
for
one
single
moment
encourage
a
doubt
but
i
beg
your
pardon
anne
that
after
having
got
you
safe
to
dublin
i
have
hurried
you
back
to
make
you
pass
a
stormy
night
at
sea
with
a
dangerous
coast
on
your
lee
but
as
you
have
escaped
shipwreck
you
may
even
come
quietly
again
to
dublin
and
setting
down
by
my
elbow
in
a
little
room
up
two
pair
of
stairs
which
is
but
superior
to
a
closet
in
a
very
small
degree
the
furniture
of
which
consists
of
a
half
tester
bed
a
deal
table
a
small
iron
grate
that
will
hold
a
handful
of
fire
and
two
rush
bottom
chairs
now
is
not
the
apartment
most
elegant
come
sit
down
and
be
quiet
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
madam
bellamy
and
her
fair
daughter
madam
o
donnel
and
her
sweet
pretty
peevish
petulant
perverse
grand
daughter
miss
caroline
o
donnel
the
old
dame
does
not
want
ideas
in
her
head
nor
language
to
express
those
ideas
but
she
is
one
of
the
most
changeable
capricious
beings
that
nature
ever
formed
her
manners
have
been
formed
upon
the
scale
of
high
life
and
she
certainly
has
in
early
days
sacrificed
to
the
graces
for
even
now
she
can
converse
with
condescending
affability
every
word
accompanied
by
a
fassinating
smile
she
can
be
cheerful
even
to
volability
persuasion
will
hang
upon
her
tongue
and
the
genius
of
taste
wit
and
elegance
preside
in
her
apartment
but
see
her
two
hours
after
you
will
not
know
her
for
the
same
woman
her
brow
will
lour
her
large
black
eyes
will
flash
malignity
the
demon
of
spite
and
slander
take
possession
of
her
tongue
and
her
language
will
be
such
as
almost
the
lowest
female
would
blush
should
sternly
insist
that
the
work
has
none
of
the
three
great
requisites
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
the
author
has
obligingly
fixed
the
beginning
at
the
first
page
and
the
end
at
the
last
leaving
every
one
to
place
the
middle
where
it
best
suits
him
or
the
learned
critic
may
make
a
beginning
by
reading
only
a
few
pages
and
an
end
by
frowning
the
whole
work
at
once
into
oblivion
whereby
two
out
of
the
three
requisites
will
certainly
be
produced
in
short
the
learned
author
in
imitation
of
high
authorities
solicits
the
indulgence
of
the
public
with
regard
to
the
appearance
of
our
common
uncle
sam
although
he
is
old
enough
to
be
very
whimsical
he
is
like
the
author
a
green
character
on
the
stage
he
will
occasionally
make
his
appearance
on
various
parts
of
it
bouncing
like
a
sturgeon
sinking
out
of
sight
and
soon
after
thundering
out
at
a
distant
part
now
if
any
one
should
be
so
impertinent
as
to
enquire
how
he
travelled
some
of
our
novel
readers
would
be
the
most
proper
persons
to
solve
the
difficulty
it
will
be
ob
served
that
another
hand
besides
the
professed
author
s
has
fingered
occasionally
in
the
work
this
with
the
discerning
will
form
no
objection
of
this
character
will
be
the
next
chapter
the
learned
ancestors
of
mine
uncle
zachary
are
well
known
to
the
hebrew
public
and
although
the
author
at
first
resolved
to
have
no
mosaic
work
in
the
splendid
structure
yet
it
occurred
to
him
that
variety
ever
has
its
attractions
and
it
is
well
known
that
stanhold
and
hopkin
s
translated
psalms
in
company
having
said
this
the
author
submits
himself
to
the
acutely
censorious
allowing
them
to
use
the
birchen
rod
whenever
they
can
find
him
chapter
ii
some
account
of
thomas
the
magician
and
it
came
to
pass
fell
out
or
happened
somewhat
before
the
time
at
which
our
history
begins
that
there
arose
a
mighty
man
in
the
land
called
thomas
the
magician
on
account
of
his
great
skill
and
cunning
in
dark
and
mysterious
projects
this
man
when
in
his
full
strength
was
a
mighty
man
of
valor
and
withal
very
tender
hearted
insomuch
that
in
the
first
notable
quarrel
between
john
bull
and
uncle
sam
he
betook
himself
to
a
huge
cavern
lest
his
great
strength
and
valor
might
do
overmuch
violence
to
his
enemies
here
he
studied
magic
necromancy
and
all
the
curious
arts
that
serve
to
make
a
man
great
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
this
thomas
was
moreover
of
a
religious
turn
of
mind
for
whereas
uncle
sam
acknowledged
only
one
god
thomas
professed
to
believe
in
twenty
or
none
as
occasion
required
whence
it
came
to
pass
that
the
multitude
for
the
space
of
many
years
cried
out
great
is
thomas
the
magician
and
it
fell
out
that
in
process
of
time
thomas
fixed
his
eye
on
the
chief
steward
ship
for
thus
he
reasoned
with
himself
behold
now
the
multitude
of
the
people
crieth
after
me
and
although
george
who
is
now
chief
steward
is
greatly
beloved
by
the
people
yet
he
now
governeth
the
household
of
samuel
by
a
new
covenant
unto
which
divers
of
them
have
not
willingly
consented
therefore
i
will
listen
diligently
and
whensoever
t
hear
a
murmuring
will
say
unto
the
people
would
it
not
have
been
better
thus
behold
did
i
not
forewarn
thee
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
take
the
servants
by
the
hand
and
say
unto
them
o
that
i
were
made
judge
in
the
land
that
any
man
having
a
matter
should
come
to
me
and
i
would
do
him
justice
nevertheless
the
people
were
not
minded
to
hearken
to
him
for
this
time
so
that
john
became
chief
steward
yet
during
the
stewardship
of
john
which
was
fifty
and
two
moons
thomas
ceased
not
to
vex
the
understanding
of
the
multitude
and
to
cause
them
to
find
much
fault
with
the
conduct
of
john
and
the
wife
of
samuel
and
caused
many
grievous
and
sore
complaints
to
be
brought
against
them
behold
said
thomas
how
mine
uncle
samuel
hath
fought
in
times
past
against
john
bull
and
hath
prevailed
nevertheless
he
oweth
at
this
time
many
talents
of
silver
yet
john
ceaseth
not
to
build
ships
and
to
have
bowmen
and
spearmen
not
a
few
and
to
lay
many
grievous
burthens
on
the
people
and
crieth
out
the
philistines
when
no
enemy
is
near
and
the
whole
land
is
in
peace
and
see
ye
not
this
woman
in
whom
the
heart
of
mine
uncle
samuel
is
bound
up
how
she
walketh
in
the
pride
of
her
imagination
and
hath
bought
many
costly
ornaments
of
silk
and
of
purple
and
delighteth
in
hoods
and
ear
rings
and
bracelets
and
nose
jewels
and
saith
i
sit
a
queen
moreover
she
whispereth
in
secret
and
backbiteth
and
mocketh
at
all
who
walk
not
in
her
ways
and
approve
not
of
her
evil
doings
and
thus
did
thomas
stir
up
the
minds
of
the
people
against
john
and
they
waxed
wroth
against
john
and
they
thrust
him
out
of
the
stewardship
and
said
unto
thomas
reign
thou
over
us
and
unto
samuel
they
said
the
counsel
of
this
woman
is
not
good
for
she
wasteth
thy
substance
lo
now
put
her
away
and
take
unto
thee
the
damsel
which
thomas
hath
provided
for
he
hath
proved
her
so
samuel
hearkened
unto
the
people
and
put
away
his
wife
and
the
thing
grieved
george
sore
howbeit
he
put
her
away
and
took
the
damsel
even
the
woman
which
thomas
had
appointed
and
he
went
in
unto
her
and
she
became
his
wife
now
thomas
had
instructed
her
aforetime
and
said
whenever
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
thou
shalt
rule
in
the
house
of
samuel
whatsoever
i
shall
bid
you
to
do
that
shalt
thou
do
without
gainsaying
and
she
said
i
will
moreover
endangers
that
is
an
enemy
not
to
me
but
to
my
country
not
your
enemy
major
asked
fleming
in
a
tone
of
surprize
no
sir
i
never
had
an
enemy
i
lost
a
hand
not
in
fighting
for
myself
but
in
defending
my
country
though
my
sword
has
tasted
blood
my
feelings
and
passions
had
no
agency
in
the
act
i
felt
that
i
was
engaged
in
a
duty
similar
to
that
in
which
we
are
engaged
in
fighting
and
subduing
our
internal
spiritual
enemies
our
evil
propensities
which
we
are
commanded
to
overcome
and
destroy
though
dearer
to
us
than
life
for
as
we
do
the
one
for
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
the
country
which
protects
us
so
we
perform
the
other
for
the
promotion
and
extension
of
our
redeemer
s
kingdom
and
our
share
of
felicity
in
each
is
always
proportionate
to
the
uses
we
perform
for
both
a
very
strange
discrimination
and
most
singular
comparison
was
fleming
s
remark
pray
friend
enquired
brown
to
what
religious
sect
dost
thou
belong
willoughby
again
smiled
to
none
sir
in
religion
as
in
politics
i
know
but
one
party
i
am
a
christian
and
know
of
no
name
under
heaven
by
which
man
can
be
saved
but
that
of
jesus
christ
our
creator
and
redeemer
but
this
is
again
flying
from
the
subject
said
fleming
you
say
sir
that
you
are
an
american
so
are
we
all
by
birth
or
adoption
but
which
of
the
two
administrations
do
you
prefer
the
federal
or
republican
mr
fleming
you
must
consider
the
question
of
considerable
importance
by
the
earnestness
with
which
you
urge
it
but
i
consider
it
of
no
importance
whatever
the
last
fifteen
years
of
my
life
has
been
passed
in
a
wilderness
i
have
taken
no
part
in
the
various
questions
of
policy
which
have
arisen
in
that
period
from
the
loop
holes
of
retreat
i
have
indeed
occasionally
peeped
at
mankind
and
like
the
poet
whose
expression
i
use
have
sighed
for
their
follies
and
crimes
i
have
seen
two
great
political
parties
by
turns
possess
the
ascendency
and
hold
the
reins
of
government
i
entirely
approve
of
neither
i
have
found
much
to
commend
but
still
more
to
condemn
in
the
measures
of
both
self
love
and
the
love
of
dominion
have
in
my
opinion
influenced
them
all
and
this
will
continue
to
be
the
case
until
human
nature
is
renovated
a
singular
politician
exclaimed
fleming
as
he
rose
to
depart
but
we
will
renew
the
subject
at
another
time
mr
brown
i
shall
expect
you
to
tea
a
still
more
singular
christian
said
the
quaker
with
a
smile
pray
tell
me
friend
how
dost
thou
reconcile
the
doctrines
of
christ
for
whom
thou
appearest
to
have
a
great
reverence
with
thy
notions
of
patriotism
and
military
duties
my
dear
sir
replied
willoughby
there
is
not
a
man
on
earth
even
the
most
zealous
of
your
sect
that
is
more
fully
convinced
than
i
am
that
all
the
wars
which
have
ever
desolated
this
fair
globe
of
earth
have
originated
from
men
s
lusts
which
war
in
the
members
the
lust
of
the
flesh
the
lust
of
the
eye
and
the
pride
of
life
are
the
fuel
which
evil
spirits
by
blasts
from
hell
too
often
kindle
to
an
infernal
blaze
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
how
then
canst
thou
conscientiously
engage
in
them
why
sir
in
my
opinion
answered
the
major
the
true
merits
of
the
question
must
rest
upon
this
point
is
it
lawful
to
resist
the
unjust
aggressions
of
wicked
men
in
their
mercenary
or
ambitious
attempts
to
rob
us
of
those
inestimable
blessings
and
unalienable
rights
which
nature
or
rather
nature
s
god
has
bestowed
upon
us
in
order
to
promote
our
happiness
and
the
happiness
of
our
posterity
trust
to
god
alone
answered
the
quaker
and
he
will
protect
them
for
us
pardon
me
replied
willoughby
would
not
that
be
like
casting
ourselves
from
the
pinnacle
of
solomon
s
temple
and
trusting
to
god
to
give
his
angels
charge
to
bear
us
up
this
would
be
tempting
god
as
the
devil
wished
our
saviour
to
tempt
him
when
he
made
that
proposition
not
knowing
that
he
was
addressing
god
himself
but
permit
me
to
illustrate
my
first
position
that
infernal
spirits
can
only
effect
their
evil
designs
in
this
world
through
the
medium
or
agency
of
such
unhappy
mortals
as
have
previously
been
brought
under
their
wicked
influence
by
passive
compliance
is
a
truth
which
no
christian
i
presume
will
deny
and
hence
by
a
transposition
as
logical
as
any
in
algebra
the
question
before
us
when
stripped
of
all
external
terms
and
forms
appears
to
be
this
is
it
lawful
upon
gospel
principles
to
arrest
or
oppose
the
movements
of
infernal
spirits
in
attempting
to
deprive
us
of
those
blessings
which
a
bountiful
and
gracious
providence
has
bestowed
upon
us
as
men
or
as
christians
i
would
answer
in
the
negative
said
the
quaker
let
every
meek
just
and
pious
man
so
oppressed
plead
rebuke
and
remonstrate
against
the
impropriety
impolicy
and
injustice
of
such
offenders
and
to
convince
and
turn
the
current
of
public
opinion
against
them
which
would
as
it
became
general
sweep
gradually
their
oppressors
into
the
fathomless
ocean
religion
is
supernatural
and
checks
self
defence
but
self
defence
sir
is
the
first
law
of
nature
it
is
a
principle
implanted
in
us
by
god
for
the
preservation
of
our
lives
it
is
this
principle
which
prompts
us
to
extend
our
hand
when
falling
or
to
guard
off
an
impending
blow
or
if
that
is
out
of
our
power
to
disable
the
hand
which
is
giving
it
i
still
think
sir
that
it
would
be
tempting
the
almighty
to
remain
in
either
case
perfectly
passive
and
trust
to
him
for
protection
i
will
grant
replied
brown
that
self
defence
is
the
first
law
of
nature
but
those
who
are
united
to
that
which
is
of
considerable
value

she
said
to
ochiltree
as
ye
wad

ye

my

that

token

business
she

o
ochiltree
looked
on
the
ring
with
some
admiration
of
its
apparent
value
and
then
carefully
replacing
it
in
the
box
and
wrapping
it
in
an
old
ragged
handkerchief
he
deposited
the
token
in
his
bosom
weel
gudewife
he
said
i
se
do
your
bidding
or
it
s
no
be
my
fault
but
surely
there
was
never
sic
a
braw
propine
as
this
sent
to
a
yerl
by
an
auld
fishwife
and
through
the
hands
of
a
gaberlunzie
beggar
with
this
reflection
edie
took
up
his
pike
staff
put
on
his
broad
brimmed
bonnet
and
set
forth
upon
his
pilgrimage
the
old
woman
remained
for
some
time
standing
in
a
fixed
posture
her
eyes
directed
to
the
door
through
which
her
ambassador
had
departed
the
appearance
of
excitation
which
the
conversation
had
occasioned
gradually
left
her
features
she
sank
down
upon
her
accustomed
seat
and
resumed
her
mechanical
labour
of
the
distaff
and
spindle
with
her
wonted
air
of
apathy
edie
ochiltree
meanwhile
advanced
on
his
journey
the
distance
to
glenallan
was
ten
miles
a
march
which
the
old
soldier
accomplished
in
about
four
hours
with
the
curiosity
belonging
to
his
idle
trade
and
animated
character
he
tortured
himself
the
whole
way
to
consider
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
mysterious
errand
with
which
he
was
entrusted
or
what
connection
the
proud
wealthy
and
powerful
earl
of
glenallan
could
have
with
the
crimes
or
penitence
of
an
old
doting
woman
whose
rank
in
life
did
not
greatly
exceed
that
of
her
messenger
he
endeavoured
to
call
to
memory
all
that
he
had
ever
known
or
heard
of
the
glenallan
family
yet
having
done
so
remained
altogether
unable
to
form
a
conjecture
on
the
subject
he
knew
that
the
whole
extensive
estate
of
this
ancient
and
powerful
family
had
descended
to
the
countess
lately
deceased
who
inherited
in
a
most
remarkable
degree
the
stern
fierce
and
unbending
character
which
had
distinguished
the
house
of
glenallan
since
they
first
figured
in
scottish
annals
like
the
rest
of
her
ancestors
she
adhered
zealously
to
the
roman
catholic
faith
and
was
married
to
an
english
gentleman
of
the
same
communion
and
of
large
fortune
who
did
not
survive
their
union
two
years
the
countess
was
therefore
left
an
early
widow
with
the
uncontrolled
management
of
the
large
estates
of
her
two
sons
the
elder
lord
geraldin
who
was
to
succeed
to
the
title
and
fortune
of
glenallan
was
totally
dependent
on
his
mother
during
her
life
the
second
when
he
came
of
age
assumed
the
name
and
arms
of
his
father
and
took
possession
of
his
estate
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
countess
s
marriage
settlement
after
this
period
he
chiefly
resided
in
england
and
paid
very
few
and
brief
visits
to
his
mother
and
brother
and
these
at
length
were
altogether
dispensed
with
in
consequence
of
his
becoming
a
convert
to
the
reformed
religion
but
even
before
this
mortal
offence
was
given
to
its
mistress
his
residence
at
glenallan
offered
few
inducements
to
a
gay
young
man
like
edward
geraldin
neville
though
its
gloom
and
seclusion
seemed
to
suit
the
retired
and
melancholy
habits
of
his
elder
brother
lord
geraldin
in
the
outset
of
life
had
been
a
young
man
of
accomplishment
and
hopes
those
who
knew
him
upon
his
travels
entertained
the
highest
expectations
of
his
future
career
but
such
fair
dawns
are
often
strangely
overcast
the
young
nobleman
returned
to
scotland
and
after
living
about
a
year
in
his
mother
s
society
at
glenallan
house
he
seemed
to
have
adopted
all
the
stern
gloom
and
melancholy
of
her
character
excluded
from
politics
by
the
incapacities
attached
to
those
of
his
religion
and
from
all
lighter
avocationas
by
choice
lord
geraldin
led
a
life
of
the
strictest
retirement
his
ordinary
society
was
composed
of
the
clergyman
of
his
communion
who
occasionally
visited
his
mansion
and
very
rarely
upon
stated
occasions
of
high
festival
one
or
two
families
who
still
professed
the
catholic
religion
were
formally
entertained
at
glenallan
house
but
this
was
all
their
heretic
neighbours
knew
nothing
of
the
family
whatever
and
even
the
catholics
saw
little
more
than
the
sumptuous
entertainment
and
solemn
parade
which
was
exhibited
on
those
formal
occasions
from
which
all
returned
without
knowing
whether
most
to
wonder
at
the
stern
and
stately
demeanour
of
the
countess
or
the
deep
and
gloomy
dejection
which
never
ceased
for
a
moment
to
cloud
the
features
of
her
son
the
late
event
had
put
him
in
possession
of
his
fortune
and
title
and
the
neighbourhood
had
already
begun
to
conjecture
whether
gaiety
would
revive
with
independence
when
those
who
had
some
occasional
acquaintance
with
the
interior
of
the
family
spread
abroad
a
report
that
the
earl
s
constitution
was
undermined
by
religious
austerities
and
that
in
all
probability
he
would
soon
follow
his
mother
to
the
grave
this
event
was
the
more
probable
as
his
brother
had
died
of
a
lingering
complaint
which
in
the
latter
years
of
his
life
had
affected
at
once
his
frame
and
his
spirits
so
that
heralds
and
genealogists
were
already
looking
back
into
their
records
to
discover
the
heir
of
this
ill
fated
family
and
lawyers
were
talking
with
gleesome
anticipation
of
the
probability
of
a
great
glenallan
cause
as
edie
ochiltree
approached
the
front
of
glenallan
house
an
ancient
building
of
great
extent
of
our
birth
if
we
do
not
shake
off
the
national
prejudices
as
we
would
the
local
superstitions
of
the
old
world
but
above
all
let
us
not
be
influenced
by
any
angry
feelings
so
far
as
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
perception
of
what
is
really
excellent
and
amiable
in
the
english
character
we
are
a
young
people
necessarily
an
imitative
one
and
must
take
our
examples
and
models
in
a
great
degree
from
the
existing
nations
of
europe
there
is
no
country
more
worthy
of
our
study
than
england
the
spirit
of
her
constitution
is
most
analogous
to
ours
the
manners
of
her
people
their
intellectual
activity
their
freedom
of
opinion
their
habits
of
thinking
on
those
subjects
which
concern
the
dearest
interests
and
most
sacred
charities
of
private
life
are
all
congenial
to
the
american
character
and
in
fact
are
all
intrinsically
excellent
for
it
is
in
the
moral
feeling
of
the
people
that
the
deep
foundations
of
british
prosperity
are
laid
and
however
the
superstructure
may
be
timeworn
or
overrun
by
abuses
there
must
be
something
solid
in
the
basis
admirable
in
the
materials
and
stable
in
the
structure
of
an
edifice
that
so
long
has
towered
unshaken
amidst
the
tempests
of
the
world
let
it
be
the
pride
of
our
writers
therefore
discarding
all
feelings
of
irritation
and
disdaining
to
retaliate
the
illiberality
of
british
authors
to
speak
of
the
english
nation
without
prejudice
and
with
determined
candor
while
they
rebuke
the
indiscriminating
bigotry
with
which
some
of
our
countrymen
admire
and
imitate
every
thing
english
merely
because
it
is
english
let
them
frankly
point
out
what
is
really
worthy
of
approbation
we
may
thus
place
england
before
us
as
a
perpetual
volume
of
reference
wherein
are
recorded
sound
deductions
from
ages
of
experience
and
while
we
avoid
the
errors
and
absurdities
which
may
have
crept
into
the
page
we
may
draw
thence
golden
maxims
of
practical
wisdom
wherewith
to
strengthen
and
to
embellish
our
national
character

the

would

and
all
their
habits
and
humors
in
some
countries
the
large
cities
absorb
the
wealth
and
fashion
of
the
nation
they
are
the
only
fixed
abodes
of
elegant
and
intelligent
society
and
the
country
is
inhabited
almost
entirely
by
boorish
peasantry
in
england
on
the
contrary
the
metropolis
is
a
mere
gathering
place
or
general
rendezvous
of
the
polite
classes
where
they
devote
a
small
portion
of
the
year

and

having
indulged
this
kind
of

return
again
to
the
apparently
more
congenial
habits
of
rural
life
the
various
orders
of
society
are
therefore
diffused
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
kingdom
and
the
more
retired
neighborhoods
afford
specimens
of
the
different
ranks
the
english
in
fact
are
strongly
gifted
with
the
rural
feeling
they
possess
a
quick
sensibility
to
the
beauties
of
nature
and
a
keen
relish
for
the
pleasures
and
employments
of
the
country
this
passion
seems
inherent
in
them
even
the
inhabitants
of
cities
born
and
brought
up
among
brick
walls
and
bustling
streets
enter
with
facility
into

for

the
merchant
has
his
snug
retreat
in
the
vicinity
of
the
metropolis
where
he
often
displays
as
much
pride
and
zeal
in
the
cultivation
of
his
flower
garden
and
the
maturing
of
his
fruits
as
he
does
in
the
conduct
of
his
business
and
the
success
of
a
commercial
enterprise
even
those
less
fortunate
individuals
who
are
doomed
to
pass
their
lives
in
the

of
din
and

contrive
to
have
something
that
shall
remind
them
of
the
green
aspect
of
nature
in
the
most
dark
and
dingy
quarters
of
the
city
the
drawing
room
window
resembles
frequently
a
bank
of
flowers
every
spot
capable
of
vegetation
has
its
grass
plot
and
flower
bed
and
every
square
its
mimic
park
laid
out
with
picturesque
taste
and
gleaming
with
refreshing
verdure
those
who
see
the
englishman
only
in
town
are
apt
to
form
an
unfavorable
opinion
of
his
social
character
he
is
either
absorbed
in
business
or
distracted
by
the
thousand
engagements
that
dissipate
time
thought
and
feeling
in
this
huge
metropolis
he
has
therefore
too
commonly
a
look
of
hurry
and
abstraction
wherever
he
happens
to
be
he
is
on
the
point
of
going
somewhere
else
at
the
moment
he
is
talking
on
one
subject
his
mind
is
wandering
to
another
and
while
paying
a
friendly
visit
he
is
calculating
how
he
shall
economize
time
so
as
to
pay
the
other
visits
allotted
to
the
morning
an
immense
metropolis
like
london
is
calculated
to
make
men
selfish
and
uninteresting
in
their
casual
and
transient
meetings
they
can
but
deal
briefly
in
commonplaces
they
present
but
the
cold
superfices
of
character
its
rich
and
genial
qualities
have
no
time
to
be
warmed
into
a
flow
it
is
in
the
country
that
the
englishman
gives
scope
to
his
natural
feelings
he
breaks
loose
gladly
from
the
cold
formalities
and
negative
civilities
of
town
throws
off
his
habits
of
shy
reserve
and
becomes
joyous
and
free
hearted
he
manages
to
collect
round
him
all
the
conveniences
and
elegancies
of
polite
life
and
to
banish
its
restraints
his
country
seat
abounds
with
every
requisite
either
for
studious
retirement
tasteful
gratification
or
rural
exercise
books
paintings
music
horses
dogs
and
sporting
implements
of
all
kinds
are
at
hand

the
fourth
performer
in
this
trial
of
memories
was
an
ancient
lady
gaily
dressed
and
intently
eager
on
the
game
between
her
and
the
young
man
was
a
large
pile
of
guineas
which
appeared
to
be
her
exclusive
property
from
which
she
repeatedly
during
the
play
tendered
one
to
his
acceptance
on
the
event
of
a
hand
or
a
trick
and
to
which
she
seldom
failed
from
inadvertence
to
add
his
mite
contributing
to
accumulate
the
pile
two
double
and
the
rub
my
dear
doctor
exclaimed
the
senior
lady
in
triumph
sir
william
you
owe
me
ten
the
money
was
paid
as
easily
as
it
had
been
won
and
the
dowager
proceeded
to
settle
some
bets
with
her
female
antagonist
two
more
i
fancy
ma
am
said
she
closely
scanning
the
contributions
of
the
maiden
i
believe
it
is
right
my
lady
was
the
answer
with
a
look
that
said
pretty
plainly
that
or
nothing
i
beg
pardon
my
dear
here
are
but
four
and
you
remember
two
on
the
corner
and
four
on
the
points
doctor
i
will
trouble
you
for
a
couple
of
guineas
from
miss
wigram
s
store
i
am
in
haste
to
get
to
the
countess
s
route
the
doctor
was
coolly
helping
himself
from
the
said
store
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
its
owner
and
secretly
exulting
in
his
own
judgment
in
requiring
the
stakes
when
the
maiden
replied
in
great
warmth
your
ladyship
forgets
the
two
you
lost
to
me
at
mrs
howard
s
it
must
be
a
mistake
my
dear
i
always
pay
as
i
lose
cried
the
dowager
with
great
spirit
stretching
over
the
table
and
helping
herself
to
the
disputed
money
mr
benfield
and
emily
had
stood
silent
spectators
of
the
whole
scene
the
latter
in
astonishment
to
meet
such
manners
in
such
society
and
the
former
under
feelings
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
describe
for
in
the
face
of
the
dowager
which
was
inflamed
partly
from
passion
and
more
from
high
living
he
recognised
the
remains
of
his
lady
juliana
now
the
dowager
viscountess
haverford
emmy
dear
said
the
old
man
with
a
heavy
drawn
sigh
as
if
awaking
from
a
long
and
troubled
dream
we
will
go
the
phantom
of
forty
years
had
vanished
before
the
truth
and
the
fancies
of
retirement
simplicity
and
a
diseased
imagination
yielded
to
the
influence
of
life
and
common
sense
chapter

with
harriet
now
closely
connected
with
them
by
marriage
as
well
as
attachment
the
baronet
s
family
maintained
a
most
friendly
intercourse
and
mrs
wilson
and
emily
a
prodigious
favorite
with
her
new
cousin
consented
to
pass
a
day
soberly
with
her
during
an
excursion
of
her
husband
to
windsor
on
business
connected
with
his
station
they
had
accordingly
driven
round
to
an
early
breakfast
and
chatterton
after
politely
regretting
his
loss
and
thanking
them
for
their
consideration
for
his
wife
made
his
bow
lady
harriet
denbigh
had
brought
the
baron
a
very
substantial
addition
to
his
fortune
and
as
his
sisters
were
both
provided
for
by
ample
settlements
the
pecuniary
distresses
which
had
existed
a
twelvemonth
before
had
been
entirely
removed
chatterton
s
income
was
now
large
his
demands
upon
it
small
and
he
kept
up
an
establishment
in
proportion
to
the
rank
of
both
husband
and
wife
mrs
wilson
cried
the
hostess
twirling
her
cup
as
she
followed
with
her
eyes
the
retreating
figure
of
her
husband
at
the
door
i
am
about
to
take
up
the
trade
of
miss
harris
and
become
a
match
maker
not
on
your
own
behalf
so
soon
surely
rejoined
the
widow
oh
no
my
fortune
is
made
for
life
or
not
at
all
continued
the
other
gaily
but
in
behalf
of
our
little
friend
emily
here
me
cried
emily
starting
from
a
reverie
in
which
the
prospect
of
happiness
to
lady
laura
was
the
subject
you
are
very
good
harriet
for
whom
do
you
intend
me
whom
who
is
good
enough
for
you
but
my
cousin
pendennyss
ah
she
cried
laughing
as
she
caught
emily
by
the
hand
derwent
and
myself
both
settled
the
matter
long
since
and
i
know
you
will
yield
when
you
come
to
know
him
the
duke
cried
the
other
with
a
surprise
and
innocence
that
immediately
brought
a
blush
of
the
brightest
vermillion
into
her
face
yes
the
duke
said
lady
chatterton
you
may
think
it
odd
for
a
discarded
lover
to
dispose
of
his
mistress
so
soon
but
both
our
hearts
are
set
upon
it
the
earl
arrived
last
night
and
this
day
he
and
his
sister
dine
with
us
in
a
sober
way
now
my
dear
madam
turning
to
mrs
wilson
have
i
not
prepared
an
agreeable
surprise
for
you
surprise
indeed
said
the
widow
excessively
gratified
at
the
probable
termination
to
her
anxieties
for
this
meeting
but
where
are
they
from
from
northamptonshire
where
the
earl
has
already
purchased
a
residence
i
understand
and
in
your
neighborhood
too
so
you
perceive
he
at
least
begins
to
think
of
the
thing
a
certain
evidence
truly
cried
emily
his
having
purchased
the
house
but
was
he
without
a
residence
that
he
bought
the
deanery
oh
no
he
has
a
palace
in
town
and
three
seats
in
the
country
but
none
in
northamptonshire
but
this
said
the
lady
with
a
laugh
to
own
the
truth
he
did
offer
to
let
george
denbigh
have
it
for
the
next
summer
but
the
colonel
chose
to
be
nearer
eltringham
and
i
take
it
it
was
only
a
ruse
in
the
earl
to
cloak
his
own
designs
you
may
depend
upon
it
we
trumpeted
your
praises
to
him
incessantly
in
westmoreland
and
is
colonel
denbigh
in
town
said
mrs
wilson
stealing
an
anxious
glance
towards
her
niece
who
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
sensibly
changed
color
oh
yes
and
laura
is
as
happy
as
happy
as
myself
said
lady
chatterton
with
a
glow
on
her
cheeks
as
she
attended
to
the
request
of
her
housekeeper
and
left
the
or
firmness
enough
to
contemplate
our
approaching
destiny
without
the
cheering
of
some
more
determined
countenance
than
their
own
the
wind
was
strong
all
day
and
the
sea
ran
very
high
our
boat
taking
in
water
from
her
leaks
continually
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
keep
one
man
constantly
bailing
during
the
night
the
weather
became
extremely
rugged
and
the
sea
every
now
and
then
broke
over
us
by
agreement
we
were
divided
into
two
watches
one
of
which
was
to
be
constantly
awake
and
doing
the
labours
of
the
boat
such
as
bailing
setting
taking
in
and
trimming
the
sails
we
kept
our
course
very
well
together
during
this
night
and
had
many
opportunities
of
conversation
with
the
men
in
the
other
boats
wherein
the
means
and
prospects
of
our
deliverance
were
variously
considered
it
appeared
from
the
opinions
of
all
that
we
had
most
to
hope
for
in
the
meeting
with
some
vessel
and
most
probably
some
whale
ship
the
great
majority
of
whom
in
those
seas
we
imagined
were
cruising
about
the
latitude
we
were
then
steering
for
but
this
was
only
a
hope
the
realization
of
which
did
not
in
any
degree
depend
on
our
own
exertions
but
on
chance
alone
it
was
not
therefore
considered
prudent
by
going
out
of
our
course
with
the
prospect
of
meeting
them
to
lose
sight
for
one
moment
of
the
strong
probabilities
which
under
divine
providence
there
were
of
our
reaching
land
by
the
route
we
had
prescribed
to
ourselves
as
that
depended
most
especially
on
a
reasonable
calculation
and
on
our
own
labours
we
conceived
that
our
provision
and
water
on
a
small
allowance
would
last
us
sixty
days
that
with
the
trade
wind
on
the
course
we
were
then
lying
we
should
be
able
to
average
the
distance
of
a
degree
a
day
which
in
days
would
enable
us
to
attain
the
region
of
the
variable
winds
and
then
in
thirty
more
at
the
very
utmost
should
there
by
any
favour
in
the
elements
we
might
reach
the
coast
with
these
considerations
we
commenced
our
voyage
the
total
failure
of
all
which
and
the
subsequent
dismal
distress
and
suffering
by
which
we
were
overtaken
will
be
shown
in
the
sequel
our
allowance
of
provision
at
first
consisted
of
bread
one
biscuit
weighing
about
one
pound
three
ounces
and
half
a
pint
of
water
a
day
for
each
man
this
small
quantity
less
than
one
third
which
is
required
by
an
ordinary
person
small
as
it
was
we
however
took
without
murmuring
and
on
many
an
occasion
afterwards
blest
god
that
even
this
pittance
was
allowed
to
us
in
our
misery
the
darkness
of
another
night
overtook
us
and
after
having
for
the
first
time
partook
of
our
allowance
of
bread
and
water
we
laid
our
weary
bodies
down
in
the
boat
and
endeavoured
to
get
some
repose
nature
became
at
last
worn
out
with
the
watchings
and
anxieties
of
the
two
preceding
nights
and
sleep
came
insensibly
upon
us
no
dreams
could
break
the
strong
fastenings
of
forgetfulness
in
which
the
mind
was
then
locked
up
but
for
my
own
part
my
thoughts
so
haunted
me
that
this
luxury
was
yet
a
stranger
to
my
eyes
every
recollection
was
still
fresh
before
me
and
i
enjoyed
but
a
few
short
and
unsatisfactory
slumbers
caught
in
the
intervals
between
my
hopes
and
my
fears
the
dark
ocean
and
swelling
waters
were
nothing
the
fears
of
being
swallowed
up
by
some
dreadful
tempest
or
dashed
upon
hidden
rocks
with
all
the
other
ordinary
subjects
of
fearful
contemplation
seemed
scarcely
entitled
to
a
moment
s
thought
the
dismal
looking
wreck
and
the
horrid
aspect
and
revenge
of
the
whale
wholly
engrossed
my
reflections
until
day
again
made
its
appearance
november
rd
in
my
chest
which
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
preserve
i
had
several
small
articles
which
we
found
of
great
service
to
us
among
the
rest
some
eight
or
ten
sheets
of
writing
paper
a
lead
pencil
a
suit
of
clothes
three
small
fish
hooks
a
jack
knife
besides
other
useful
purposes
served
us
as
a
razor
it
was
with
much
difficulty
however
that
i
could
keep
any
sort
of
record
owing
to
the
incessant
rocking
and
unsteadiness
of
the
boat
and
the
continual
dashing
of
the
spray
of
the
sea
over
us
the
boat
contained
in
addition
to
the
articles
enumerated
a
lantern
tinderbox
and
two
or
three
candles
which
belonged
to
her
and
with
which
they
are
kept
always
supplied
while
engaged
in
taking
whale
in
addition
to
all
which
the
captain
had
saved
a
musket
two
pistols
and
a
canister
containing
about
two
pounds
of
gunpowder
the
latter
he
distributed
in
equal
proportions
between
the
three
boats
and
gave
the
second
mate
and
myself
each
a
pistol
when
morning
came
we
found
ourselves
quite
near
together
and
the
wind
had
considerably
increased
since
the
day
before
we
were
consequently
obliged
to
reef
our
sales
and
although
we
did
not
apprehend
any
very
great
danger
from
the
then
violence
of
the
wind
yet
it
grew
to
be
very
uncomfortable
in
the
boats
from
the
repeated
dashing
of
the
waves
that
kept
our
bodies
constantly
wet
with
the
salt
spray
we
however
stood
along
our
course
until
twelve
o
clock
when
we
got
an
observation
as
well
as
we
were
able
to
obtain
one
while
the
water
flew
all
over
us
and
the
sea
kept
the
boat
extremely
unsteady
we
found
ourselves
this
day
in
latitude
s
having
repassed
the
equator
we
abandoned
the
idea
altogether
of
keeping
any
correct
longitudinal
reckoning
having
no
glass
nor
log
line
the
wind
moderated
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
a
little
but
at
night
came
on
to
blow
again
almost
a
gale
we
began
now
to
tremble
for
our
little
barque
she
was
so
ill
calculated
in
point
of
strength
to
withstand
the
racking
of
the
sea
while
it
required
the
constant
labours
of
one
man
to
keep
her
giving
her
the
picturesque
and
and
beautiful
aspect
of
a
greek
girl
and
now
she
would
toss
it
wildly
over
her
temples
and
bosom
till
she
resembled
some
terrified
bacchante
his
own
daughters
sat
laughing
and
pouting
by
her
side
occasionally
interfering
and
squabbling
about
the
gracefulness
and
effect
of
this
cluster
or
that
waving
luxuriant
mass
that
flowed
as
if
it
were
liquid
silk
over
her
shoulders
he
laid
his
parental
hand
upon
loena
s
head
and
put
his
lips
to
her
forehead
she
coloured
but
seized
his
hand
and
blessed
him
with
that
fervour
that
innocent
and
natural
fervour
which
is
not
to
be
counterfeited
or
affected
her
emotion
choked
her
the
conversation
so
long
dreaded
was
soon
began
and
the
countenances
of
all
grew
more
and
more
serious
mournful
sad
as
he
proceeded
until
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
room
a
frigate
was
to
sail
the
same
evening
for
calaisharold
was
to
depart
in
her
harold
faintly
articulated
the
gasping
girl
shut
her
eyes
harold
echoed
all
the
others
the
word
died
away
on
their
lips
they
all
clung
to
poor
loena
with
hands
and
mouths
as
she
buried
her
face
in
the
lap
of
the
countess
a
sad
presentiment
sat
heavily
upon
her
heart
so
much
admonition
so
much
advice
so
much
gentle
insinuation
so
many
new
feelings
and
thoughts
about
propriety
conjured
up
it
could
not
be
for
slight
purposes
yet
what
was
she
to
fear
they
were
to
go
together
together
were
they
oh
yes
but
then
he
said
harold
harold
only
i
will
go
she
exclaimed
starting
upon
her
feet
forgetful
of
their
presence
i
will
go
with
him
the
wide
world
over
let
me
see
who
shall
dare
to
oppose
me
harold
come
thou
to
my
defence
they
had
been
watching
every
movement
and
devandreueil
now
left
the
room
saying
to
his
wife
significantly
that
he
left
loena
to
her
care
oh
said
the
countess
after
a
few
moments
of
mournful
silence
while
the
dim
eyes
of
the
indian
girl
were
searching
out
the
mystery
of
this
behaviour
with
a
look
unutterable
expostulation
oh
as
if
she
that
moment
recollected
herself
oh
how
long
is
it
my
dear
she
stopped
a
moment
for
she
found
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
make
herself
intelligible
to
loena
whose
early
lessons
in
french
were
but
just
beginning
to
revive
besides
she
was
startled
at
her
own
abruptness
and
inwardly
awed
at
the
calm
melancholy
the
beautiful
self
possession
that
arose
gradually
upon
the
youthful
countenance
before
her
as
if
to
rebuke
all
particular
inquiry
so
much
for
her
lessons
in
propriety
but
her
lip
trembled
and
she
pressed
the
hand
of
the
countess
and
put
her
mouth
meekly
upon
the
blue
veins
as
if
conscious
that
this
was
not
the
time
for
the
princess
to
be
seen
no
but
for
the
woman
the
tender
and
impassioned
woman
alone
a
tear
fell
upon
the
hand
she
stooped
with
her
luxuriant
tresses
and
would
have
wiped
it
away
but
her
mother
fur
thrice
had
the
lady
called
her
daughter
and
her
heart
earned
to
show
its
sensibility
to
the
endearing
relationship
her
mother
forbad
it
and
dismissed
the
girl
and
children
with
her
hand
i
am
abrupt
love
she
said
i
know
that
i
am
but
thy
frank
nature
is
accustomed
to
that
thou
art
a
woman
a
young
inexperienced
and
enthusiastick
woman
i
tremble
for
thee
here
thou
hast
come
a
stranger
my
child
an
innocent
unfriended
unsupported
helpless
stranger
among
strangers
loena
s
eyes
overflowed
with
no
brother
no
lather
no
sister
not
even
one
of
thy
nation
loena
attempted
to
speak
what
sayest
thou
lover
nay
do
not
weep
poor
loena
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
the
countess
continued
no
father
no
mother
oh
yes
thou
hast
i
will
be
thy
mother
my
sweet
girl
wilt
thou
be
my
daughter
i
will
o
i
will
faintly
whispered
the
fainting
girl
bid
me
as
thou
wilt
i
will
do
thy
bidding
my
mother
my
dear
dear
mother
the
countess
embraced
her
passionately
the
contact
was
inconceivably
affecting
to
both
loena
felt
as
if
her
own
mother
had
risen
from
the
grave
and
the
countess
as
if
caressing
her
youngest
born
the
child
of
her
old
age
behold
them
a
beautiful
woman
a
french
woman
a
parisienne
locked
to
the
bosom
of
a
young
american
an
indian
girl
brown
and
sparkling
with
barbarian
ornament
locked
too
as
a
mother
and
daughter
in
overwhelming
and
inexpressible
tenderness
it
was
the
union
of
ministering
intelligences
the
priesthood
of
loveliness
among
the
oppressors
and
the
oppressed
fashion
and
nature
the
perfection
of
art
and
the
simplicity
of
unadulterate
uncontaminate
nature
my
daughter
compose
thyself
continued
the
countess
lean
awhile
on
me
the
bosom
of
thy
mother
why
how
thy
temples
throb
child
and
the
sweat
i
declare
thy
hair
is
wet
on
thy
forehead
with
it
verily
verily
but
thou
art
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
we
are
all
so
woman
is
at
best
but
frailly
delicately
constituted
but
thou
art
so
in
an
especial
manner
more
a
thing
of
intellect
and
nerve
and
spirit
than
aught
that
i
know
even
among
women
come
come
cheer
up
and
prepare
thyself
thy
heart
too
why
it
is
coming
through
thy
side
it
feels
mother
as
if
it
would
indeed
answered
the
trembling
girl
as
she
shook
back
her
redundant
hair
and
looked
up
in
her
face
with
a
quivering
lip
and
a
pale
very
pale
cheek
it
feels
mother
as
if
it
were
nothing
but
ashes
o
it
is
dry
pulverised
there
is
no
moisture
in
it
i
would
weep
but
i
cannot
weep
i
cannot
shed
another
tear
but
go
on
my
mother
o
how
it
delights
me
to
pronounce
the
strange
word
ma
mere
ma
mere
i
am
prepared
saying
this
she
arose
and
sat
upright
upheld
and
sustained
by
her
own
unconquerable
spirit
now
was
to
be
the
trial
she
was
sure
of
it
said
poor
lucy
i
never
felt
so
much
for
her
that
s
right
child
now
we
will
go
on
but
first
let
that
tear
drop
that
glistens
in
the
moonbeam
fall
on
the
grave
it
helps
to
keep
the
grass
green
and
the
dead
like
to
be
cried
for
she
added
mournfully
they
now
proceeded
crazy
bet
leading
the
way
with
long
and
hasty
strides
in
a
diagonal
course
still
ascending
the
hill
till
she
plunged
into
a
deep
wood
so
richly
clothed
with
foliage
as
to
be
impervious
to
the
moon
beams
and
so
choaked
with
underbrush
that
jane
found
it
very
difficult
to
keep
up
with
her
pioneer
they
soon
however
emerged
into
an
open
space
completely
surrounded
and
enclosed
by
lofty
trees
crazy
bet
had
not
spoken
since
they
began
their
walk
she
now
stopped
and
turning
abruptly
to
jane
do
you
know
said
she
who
are
the
worshippers
that
meet
in
this
temple
the
spirits
that
were
sometime
disobedient
but
since
he
went
and
preached
to
them
they
came
out
from
their
prison
house
and
worship
in
the
open
air
and
under
the
light
of
the
blessed
heavens
it
is
a
beautiful
spot
said
jane
i
should
think
all
obedient
spirits
might
worship
in
this
temple
say
you
so
then
worship
with
me
the
maniac
fell
on
her
knees
jane
knelt
beside
her
she
had
caught
a
spark
of
her
companion
s
enthusiasm
the
singularity
of
her
situation
the
beauty
of
the
night
the
novelty
of
the
place
on
which
the
moon
now
riding
high
in
the
heavens
poured
a
flood
of
silver
light
all
conspired
to
give
a
high
tone
to
her
feelings
it
is
not
strange
she
should
have
thought
she
never
heard
any
thing
so
sublime
as
the
prayer
of
her
crazed
conductor
who
raised
her
arms
and
poured
out
her
soul
in
passages
of
scripture
the
most
sublime
and
striking
woven
together
by
her
own
glowing
language
she
concluded
suddenly
and
springing
on
her
feet
said
to
jane
now
follow
me
fear
not
and
falter
not
for
you
know
what
awaits
the
fearful
and
unbelieving
jane
assured
her
she
had
no
fear
but
that
of
being
too
late
you
need
not
think
of
that
the
spirit
never
quits
till
i
come
they
now
turned
into
the
wood
by
a
narrow
pathway
whose
entrance
laid
under
the
shadow
of
two
young
beach
trees
crazy
bet
paused
see
ye
these
child
said
she
pointing
to
the
trees
i
know
two
who
grew
up
thus
on
the
same
spot
of
earth
so
lovingly
they
grew
and
she
pointed
to
the
interlacing
of
the
branches
young
and
beautiful
but
the
pxe
was
laid
to
the
root
of
one
and
the
other
and
she
pressed
both
her
hands
on
her
head
and
screamed
wildly
died
here
a
burst
of
tears
afforded
her
a
sudden
relief
poor
broken
hearted
creature
murmured
jane
no
child
when
she
weeps
then
the
band
is
loosened
for
added
she
drawing
closer
to
jane
and
whispering
they
put
an
iron
band
around
her
head
and
when
she
is
in
darkness
it
presses
till
she
thinks
she
is
in
the
place
of
the
tormenter
by
the
light
of
the
moon
it
s
loosened
you
cannot
see
it
but
it
is
there
always
there
jane
began
now
to
be
alarmed
at
the
excitement
of
bet
s
imagination
and
turning
from
her
abruptly
entered
the
path
which
after
they
had
proceeded
a
few
yards
seemed
to
be
leading
them
into
a
wild
trackless
region
where
are
we
going
bet
she
exclaimed
through
a
pass
child
that
none
knows
but
the
wild
bird
and
the
wild
woman
have
you
never
heard
of
the
caves
of
the
mountain
yes
replied
jane
but
i
had
rather
not
go
through
them
to
night
cannot
we
go
some
other
way
nay
there
is
no
other
way
follow
me
and
fear
not
jane
had
often
heard
of
the
pass
called
the
mountain
caves
and
she
believed
it
had
only
been
penetrated
by
a
few
rash
youths
of
daring
and
adventurous
spirit
she
was
appalled
at
the
thought
of
entering
it
in
the
dead
of
night
and
with
such
a
conductor
she
paused
but
she
could
see
no
way
of
escape
and
summoning
all
her
resolution
she
followed
bet
who
took
no
note
of
her
scruples
they
now
entered
a
defile
which
apparently
had
been
made
by
some
tremendous
convulsion
of
nature
that
had
rent
the
mountain
asunder
and
piled
rock
on
rock
in
the
deep
abyss
the
breadth
of
the
passage
which
was
walled
in
by
the
perpendicular
sides
of
the
mountain
was
not
in
any
place
more
than
twenty
feet
and
sometimes
so
narrow
that
jane
thought
she
might
have
extended
her
arms
quite
across
it
but
she
had
no
leisure
for
critical
accuracy
her
wayward
guide
pressed
on
heedless
of
the
difficulties
of
the
way
she
would
pass
between
huge
rocks
that
had
rolled
so
near
together
as
to
leave
but
a
very
narrow
passage
between
them
then
grasping
the
tangled
roots
that
projected
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
placing
her
feet
in
the
fissures
of
the
rocks
or
in
the
little
channels
that
had
been
worn
by
the
continual
dropping
from
the
mountain
rills
she
would
glide
over
swiftly
and
safely
as
if
she
had
been
on
the
beaten
highway
they
were
sometimes
compelled
in
the
depths
of
the
caverns
to
prostrate
themselves
and
creep
through
narrow
apertures
between
the
rocks
it
was
impossible
to
surmount
and
jane
felt
that
she
was
passing
over
masses
of
ice
the
accumulation
perhaps
of
a
hundred
winters
she
was
fleet
and
agile
and
inspired
with
almost
supernatural
courage
she
though
a
woman
naturally
born
to
fears
followed
on
resolutely
till
they
came
to
an
immense
rock
whose
conical
and
giant
form
rested
on
broken
masses
below
that
on
every
side
were
propping
this
mighty
monarch
of
the
scene
for
the
first
time
crazy
bet
seemed
to
remember
she
had
a
facilitate
his
passage
by
enabling
him
the
more
easily
to
drag
his
body
through
the
only
obstacle
that
perplexed
him
was
a
strong
iron
grating
that
was
fixed
over
its
entrance
this
he
however
was
determined
to
overcome
by
some
energetic
effort
his
chief
difficulty
was
in
persuading
the
doctor
as
to
the
practicability
of
the
scheme
at
length
when
the
latter
perceived
that
no
reasoning
would
prevent
peter
from
trying
it
he
determined
not
to
desert
him
but
to
assist
all
he
could
although
he
anticipated
all
the
evil
consequences
of
complete
failure
and
detection
in
pursuance
of
this
resolution
having
secretly
provided
a
small
bag
full
of
provisions
and
a
couple
of
spades
they
one
dark
night
about
two
weeks
after
the
doctor
s
rescue
when
all
the
garrison
except
the
sentinels
had
gone
to
sleep
scaled
the
low
wooden
fence
that
surrounded
the
washer
woman
s
yard
and
commenced
their
operations
by
digging
a
hole
close
to
the
grate
sufficiently
large
to
admit
their
entrance
as
the
ground
was
soft
and
peter
an
excellent
spadesman
this
was
only
the
work
of
about
fifteen
minutes
and
into
the
mud
bottomed
pit
he
plunged
without
hesitation
head
foremost
dragging
by
means
of
a
strong
cord
attached
to
it
the
bag
of
provisions
after
him
the
doctor
had
now
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
for
the
first
three
or
four
yards
they
swam
or
paddled
like
ducks
in
the
stagnant
water
which
had
here
collected
to
the
depth
of
eight
or
ten
inches
on
account
of
some
deficiency
in
its
fall
towards
the
creek
but
this
was
the
easiest
part
of
their
progress
for
during
the
remainder
peter
found
the
passage
so
small
that
it
required
all
his
perseverance
and
strength
to
squeeze
himself
forward
which
however
he
persisted
in
doing
and
at
last
with
incredible
labour
and
not
without
great
fatigue
and
soreness
of
both
flesh
and
bones
he
arrived
at
the
open
air
on
the
bank
of
the
creek
the
doctor
being
a
smaller
man
found
less
difficulty
in
passing
especially
as
the
efforts
of
peter
had
cleared
the
way
for
him
although
enveloped
in
a
complete
vesture
of
mud
and
dirt
our
adventurers
did
not
wait
to
wash
themselves
in
the
creek
but
taking
to
the
woods
hastened
on
as
speedily
as
the
darkness
and
the
numerous
impediments
of
the
way
would
permit
towards
the
alleghany
river
daylight
overtook
them
while
yet
in
the
intricacies
of
the
forest
when
being
both
hungry
and
fatigued
they
thought
proper
to
enjoy
some
of
such
fare
as
their
bag
afforded
and
then
to
repose
themselves
for
a
few
hours
about
noon
they
again
proceeded
and
continued
their
journey
till
the
evening
when
resolving
not
to
undergo
the
fatigue
of
another
night
struggling
amidst
brush
wood
swamps
and
fallen
timber
they
selected
a
place
of
shelter
and
by
collecting
together
a
quantity
of
dry
leaves
made
themselves
as
comfortable
a
bed
as
they
could
on
which
their
fatigue
and
long
wakefulness
enabled
them
to
sleep
soundly
till
the
morning
after
three
days
troublesome
journeying
in
this
manner
during
which
they
became
sometimes
afraid
of
not
being
on
their
proper
course
they
arrived
at
the
alleghany
river
a
short
distance
below
its
confluence
with
french
creek
from
thence
they
kept
down
the
stream
of
the
river
for
upwards
of
four
days
and
it
was
the
ninth
from
their
leaving
le
boeuf
before
they
met
with
charles
as
already
stated
chapter
xv
survey
his
front
where
wisdom
sits
serene
and
the
bright
flashing
of
his
fearless
eye
that
gallant
port
that
majesty
of
mien
which
promise
deeds
of
unsurpass
d
emprise
such
as
to
minstrelsy
its
fondest
theme
supplies
and
gains
the
palm
the
world
may
not
deny
basket
of
scraps
the
dearest
to
each
other
are
often
doomed
to
part
it
is
one
of
the
evils
incident
to
humanity
and
one
from
which
all
the
philosophy
in
the
world
will
not
relieve
us
the
best
way
therefore
to
meet
the
evil
is
to
do
it
courageously
and
philosophize
nothing
about
it
charles
adderly
on
this
occasion
did
so
and
in
consequence
he
succeeded
in
separating
from
maria
with
a
reluctant
heart
it
must
be
confessed
but
not
with
a
desponding
one
his
party
consisting
of

ever
thought
of
attempting
a
journey
of
even
a
short
distance
through
the
wilderness
without
being
properly
prepared
for
both
defence
and
attack
on
the
third
day
they
crossed
the
chesnut
ridge
and
encamped
that
night
between
it
and
the
laurel
hill
in
what
is
now
called
ligonier
valley
as
they
were
about
continuing
their
journey
the
next
morning
they
were
unexpectedly
attacked
by
a
small
party
of
otawas
whom
the
french
had
despatched
to
scour
the
country
in
pursuit
of
peter
and
the
doctor
the
savages
however
had
given
their
fire
at
too
great
a
distance
to
do
any
serious
mischief
two
of
their
shots
feebly
pierced
through
a
package
of
paddy
s
furs
and
another
slightly
wounded
one
of
the
horses
the
rest
fell
altogether
harmless
each
of
our
travellers
immediately
took
to
a
tree
and
kept
up
such
a
well
directed
fire
upon
their
enemies
when
any
of
them
dared
to
appear
in
sight
that
the
latter
thought
proper
about
mid
day
to
withdraw
after
having
lost
five
or
six
of
their
number
who
were
killed
on
the
spot
our
party
then
cautiously
proceeded
onwards
keeping
on
all
directions
a
good
look
out
which
obliged
them
to
travel
so
slowly
that
they
only
reached
the
top
of
the
laurel
a
vacant
stare
some
few
years
afterward
during
the
late
war
i
saw
the
same
man
approaching
again
and
i
resolved
to
check
his
career
accordingly
i
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
road
and
stretched
wide
both
my
arms
and
cried
stop
sir
on
your
peril
at
this
the
man
said
now
lightfoot
confound
the
robber
at
the
same
time
he
gave
the
whip
liberally
to
the
flank
of
his
horse
which
bounded
off
with
such
force
that
it
appeared
to
me
two
such
horses
give
them
a
place
to
stand
would
overcome
any
check
man
could
devise
an
ammunition
wagon
which
had
just
passed
on
to
baltimore
had
dropped
an
eighteen
pounder
in
the
road
this
unlucky
ball
lay
in
the
way
of
the
horse
s
heels
and
the
beast
with
the
sagacity
of
a
demon
clinched
it
with
of
his
heels
and
hurled
it
behind
him
i
feel
dizzy
in
relating
the
fact
but
so
nearly
did
the
ball
pass
my
head
that
the
wind
thereof
blew
off
my
hat
and
the
ball
embedded
itself
in
that
gate
post
as
you
may
see
if
you
will
cast
your
eye
on
the
post
i
have
permitted
it
to
remain
there
in
memory
of
the
occurrence
as
the
people
of
boston
i
am
told
preserve
the
eighteen
pounder
which
is
now
to
be
seen
half
embedded
in
brattle
street
church
i
then
took
leave
of
the
toll
gatherer
and
promised
him
if
i
saw
or
heard
of
his
gate
i
would
send
him
notice
a
strong
inclination
had
possessed
me
to
arrest
rugg
and
search
his
pockets
thinking
great
discoveries
might
be
made
in
the
examination
but
what
i
saw
and
heard
that
day
convinced
me
that
no
human
force
could
detain
peter
rugg
against
his
consent
i
therefore
determined
if
i
ever
saw
rugg
again
to
treat
him
in
the
gentlest
manner
in
pursuing
my
way
to
new
york
i
entered
on
the
turnpike
in
trenton
and
when
i
arrived
at
new
brunswick
i
perceived
the
road
was
newly
macadamized
the
small
stones
had
just
been
laid
thereon
as
i
passed
this
piece
of
road
i
observed
that
at
regular
distances
of
about
eight
feet
the
stones
were
entirely
displaced
from
spots
as
large
as
the
circumference
of
a
half
bushel
measure
this
singular
appearance
induced
me
to
inquire
the
cause
of
it
at
the
turnpike
gate
sir
said
the
toll
gatherer
i
wonder
not
at
the
question
but
i
am
unable
to
give
you
a
satisfactory
answer
indeed
sir
i
believe
i
am
bewitched
and
that
the
turnpike
is
under
a
spell
of
enchantment
for
what
appeared
to
me
last
night
cannot
be
a
real
transaction
otherwise
a
turnpike
is
a
useless
thing
i
do
not
believe
in
witchcraft
or
enchantment
said
i
and
if
you
will
relate
circumstantially
what
happened
last
night
i
will
endeavour
to
account
for
it
by
natural
means
you
may
recollect
the
night
was
uncommonly
dark
well
sir
just
after
i
had
closed
the
gate
for
the
night
down
the
turnpike
as
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
i
beheld
what
at
first
appeared
to
be
two
armies
engaged
the
report
of
the
musketry
and
the
flashes
of
their
firelocks
were
incessant
and
continuous
as
this
strange
spectacle
approached
me
with
the
fury
of
a
tornado
the
noise
increased
and
the
appearance
rolled
on
in
one
compact
body
over
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
most
splendid
fireworks
rose
out
of
the
earth
and
encircled
this
moving
spectacle
the
divers
tints
of
the
rainbow
the
most
brilliant
dyes
that
the
sun
lays
in
the
lap
of
spring
added
to
the
whole
family
of
gems
could
not
display
a
more
beautiful
radiant
and
dazzling
spectacle
than
accompanied
the
black
horse
you
would
have
thought
all
the
stars
of
heaven
had
met
in
merriment
on
the
turnpike
in
the
midst
of
this
luminous
configuration
sat
a
man
distinctly
to
be
seen
in
a
miserable
looking
chair
drawn
by
a
black
horse
the
turnpike
gate
ought
by
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
laws
of
the
state
to
have
made
a
wreck
of
the
whole
and
have
dissolved
the
enchantment
but
no
the
horse
without
an
effort
passed
over
the
gate
and
drew
the
man
and
chair
horizontally
after
him
without
touching
the
bar
this
was
what
i
call
enchantment
what
think
you
sir
my
friend
said
i
you
have
grossly
magnified
a
natural
occurrence
the
man
was
peter
rugg
on
his
way
to
boston
it
is
true
his
horse
travelled
with
unequalled
speed
but
as
he
reared
high
his
forefeet
he
could
not
help
displacing
the
thousand
small
stones
on
which
he
trod
which
flying
in
all
directions
struck
one
another
and
resounded
and
scintillated
the
top
bar
of
your
gate
is
not
more
than
two
feet
from
the
ground
and
rugg
s
horse
at
every
vault
could
easily
lift
the
carriage
over
that
gate
this
satisfied
mr
mcdoubt
and
i
was
pleased
at
that
occurrence
for
otherwise
mr
mcdoubt
who
is
a
worthy
man
late
from
the
highlands
might
have
added
to
his
calendar
of
superstitions
having
thus
disenchanted
the
macadamized
road
and
the
turnpike
gate
and
also
mr
mcdoubt
i
pursued
my
journey
homeward
to
new
york
little
did
i
expect
to
see
or
hear
anything
further
of
mr
rugg
for
he
was
now
more
than
twelve
hours
in
advance
of
me
i
could
hear
nothing
of
him
on
my
way
to
elizabethtown
and
therefore
concluded
that
during
the
past
night
he
had
turned
off
from
the
turnpike
and
pursued
a
westerly
direction
but
just
before
i
arrived
at
powles
s
hook
i
observed
a
considerable
collection
of
passengers
in
the
ferry
boat
all
standing
motionless
and
steadily
looking
at
the
same
object
one
of
the
ferry
men
mr
hardy
who
knew
me
well
observing
my
approach
delayed
a
minute
in
order
to
afford
me
a
passage
and
coming
up
said
mr
dunwell
we
have
a
curiosity
on
board
that
would
puzzle
sword
against
the
french
and
indians
in
this
land
of
promise
he
referred
to
the
scriptural
account
of
the
march
of
the
israelites
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
house
of
bondage
and
applied
it
literally
as
did
many
others
to
the
emigration
of
the
puritans
and
he
derived
his
authority
for
much
of
his
own
conduct
from
the
fighting
part
of
the
character
of
joshua
the
onondagas
the
tuscaroras
the
wampagoes
and
the
potawatamies
were
with
him
but
the
other
names
for
the
hittites
perezites
jebuzites
and
gergushites
all
whom
were
to
be
exterminated
indeed
if
father
raal
in
his
way
from
penobscot
to
his
catholic
friends
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
miles
standish
he
would
have
considered
the
fate
of
agag
as
his
sufficient
warrant
he
possessed
vigorous
strength
was
patient
of
fatigue
and
fixed
in
his
purpose
a
man
as
southey
says
firm
to
resolve
and
stubborn
to
endure
he
sat
reading
pilgrim
s
progress
which
he
allegorized
beyond
the
spirit
of
bunyan
himself
letter
xi
after
hearing
du
quesne
without
interruption
are
you
said
he
true
men
and
no
spies
is
it
not
to
spy
out
the
nakedness
of
the
land
ye
are
come
you
sir
must
be
a
frenchman
and
surely
if
ever
i
saw
one
this
is
an
indian
know
you
not
that
it
is
against
such
that
i
have
come
to
fight
i
have
the
authority
of
scripture
history
it
is
in
vain
for
the
keemites
to
attempt
deceiving
me
with
their
old
shoes
and
clouted
tattered
garments
and
moldy
bread
and
broken
bottles
the
dialogue
between
them
lasted
some
time
the
engaging
manners
and
conversation
of
du
quesne
interested
the
chieftain
though
it
was
apparent
he
doubted
the
truth
of
the
story
and
looked
on
the
disinterested
heroism
of
weshop
particularly
as
apocryphal
but
aside
from
his
incredulity
and
some
strong
suspicions
of
design
he
resolved
not
to
cross
the
jake
but
to
keep
his
provincials
within
the
boundary
of
new
england
he
cared
as
little
for
the
dutch
as
for
the
french
let
them
said
he
to
himself
fight
it
out
between
themselves
and
if
the
indians
take
sides
so
much
the
better
great
was
the
joy
of
du
quesne
when
he
heard
that
dudley
his
long
lost
and
as
he
supposed
far
distant
friend
was
on
the
spot
and
the
second
in
command
he
hastened
to
his
quarters
where
he
found
dubourg
and
his
daughter
standish
was
present
at
this
cordial
interview
and
listened
once
more
but
with
greater
confidence
and
interest
to
the
story
and
request
the
anxiety
of
dudley
was
extreme
he
saw
the
emaciated
form
of
du
quesne
worn
down
by
famine
fatigue
and
suffering
represented
to
himself
the
exposure
of
van
tromp
to
a
fate
from
which
it
might
even
now
be
too
late
to
save
him
and
made
up
his
mind
i
will
go
and
that
immediately
if
i
go
alone
major
standish
said
he
this
is
no
matter
of
political
or
provincial
interest
it
is
my
private
business
and
of
great
emergency
providence
gives
me
this
opportunity
perhaps
the
only
one
of
redeeming
a
sacred
pledge
my
sworn
my
bosom
friend
is
in
peril
see
said
he
pointing
to
weshop
what
an
example
even
this
man
has
set
me
ah
he
s
a
keenite
said
standish
wringing
weshop
s
hand
worthy
to
be
ranked
with
squantum
himself
in
a
case
like
this
i
will
not
be
outdone
by
the
best
heathen
that
ever
lived
weshop
but
come
there
s
no
time
to
lose
beat
to
arms
i
wish
added
he
in
a
lower
tone
to
dudley
that
weshop
was
a
christian
he
would
make
a
better
one
than
some
white
men
i
know
of
but
now
have
the
boats
ready
i
ll
show
you
how
to
deal
with
indians
when
you
catch
them
on
fair
ground
in
a
body
weshop
you
must
lead
us
captain
dudley
we
march
indian
file
without
music
three
ferriages
will
carry
over
as
many
as
we
want
let
the
ladies
stay
with
those
who
keep
guard
at
the
camp
if
i
do
nt
return
i
ll
send
for
them
during
the
bustle
of
a
slight
and
rapid
preparation
the
young
lady
found
means
to
set
her
large
dark
eyes
on
du
quesne
and
beckon
him
towards
her
this
sir
said
she
is
no
time
for
ceremony
or
affected
delicacy
i
feel
interested
for
the
safety
of
your
friend
i
shall
wait
here
oh
with
how
much
anxiety
to
hear
of
your
arrival
in
time
to
save
him
and
beg
that
as
soon
as
it
is
safe
i
may
be
immediately
sent
for
to
join
you
and
mr
dudley
at
the
blasted
tree
i
know
from
your
zeal
you
will
save
him
i
know
you
will
but
you
have
eaten
nothing
these
hasty
men
have
forgotten
to
ask
you
and
you
have
forgotten
to
call
here
i
will
set
a
table
for
you
and
wait
upon
you
myself
i
must
not
eat
without
my
friend
who
the
indian
warrior
that
brought
me
here
oh
weshop
i
know
him
let
me
call
him
myself
weshop
came
back
but
the
honest
fellow
could
not
stay
for
a
regular
meal
he
took
a
quantity
of
provision
in
his
hand
to
eat
as
he
went
onward
to
the
place
of
embarkation
saying
as
he
left
the
shore
make
haste
make
haste
the
party
in
fine
order
and
under
strict
discipline
were
soon
paraded
marched
and
wheeled
to
the
landing
the
lake
at
a
narrow
place
was
ferried
over
again
and
again
till
all
but
a
guard
for
the
defence
of
the
women
and
the
few
effects
that
were
left
behind
had
quit
the
shore
miles
standish
directed
the
embarkation
himself
and
brought
up
the
rear
in
the
last
boat
with
his
drummer
trumpeter
and
bugleman
and
as
he
had
an
ear
for
music
and
a
strong
taste
for
sublime
scenery
he
directed
them
to
play
old
hundred
and
accompanied
them
with
his
more
daring
in
the
declaration
of
his
belief
but
it
was
not
until
the
sabbath
after
ordination
that
he
publicly
evinced
his
adherence
to
the
rites
of
the
episcopal
church
a
meeting
was
held
in
a
vacant
building
which
had
been
erected
as
a
common
house
until
more
convenient
dwellings
could
be
procured
here
a
considerable
number
were
collected
and
the
english
ritual
was
read
and
the
sacrament
administered
by
mr
blackstone
in
his
full
canonical
robes
according
to
the
ceremonies
prescribed
by
james
and
his
bishops
at
the
council
of
hampton
house
this
was
a
thing
not
to
be
passed
over
mr
blackstone
living
alone
in
his
solitary
hut
at
tri
mountain
was
out
of
their
jurisdiction
but
brown
and
his
brother
were
the
next
morning
ordered
to
appear
before
an
assembly
of
the
elders
to
answer
the
charges
brought
against
them
at
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
inhabitants
of
salem
were
seen
again
collecting
at
their
meetinghouse
to
hear
what
could
be
said
in
defence
of
the
culprits
after
a
suitable
pause
the
governor
arose
as
he
said
you
mr
charles
and
samuel
brown
are
accused
of
fomenting
disturbance
among
the
people
forasmuch
as
you
have
taught
them
that
under
the
shadow
of
the
mitre
is
the
only
place
where
men
ought
to
worship
do
you
plead
guilty
thereto
that
i
bow
with
reverence
before
the
holy
mitre
is
most
true
governor
endicott
but
in
no
respect
whatever
have
i
bred
disturbance
among
the
people
have
you
not
interrupted
mr
conant
have
you
not
made
them
drink
of
the
wine
of
babylon
yea
have
you
not
made
them
drunk
with
her
fornication
have
you
not
like
the
red
dragon
pursued
the
church
into
the
wilderness
and
poured
out
a
flood
after
her
that
you
might
cause
her
to
be
destroyed
my
answers
are
to
governor
endicott
and
the
elders
of
what
you
term
the
church
replied
brown
with
respectful
coldness
mr
conant
said
the
governor
these
things
should
be
done
decently
and
in
order
it
is
the
business
of
men
in
authority
to
inquire
into
this
matter
have
you
young
man
upheld
the
ritual
of
the
firstborn
daughter
of
the
church
of
rome
and
maintained
that
the
arm
of
royal
authority
ought
to
enforce
obedience
thereto
i
have
said
replied
brown
that
religio
docenda
est
non
coercenda
was
a
bad
maxim
of
state
policy
and
that
hresis
dedocenda
est
non
permittenda
was
a
far
better
if
by
the
first
born
daughter
of
rome
you
mean
that
church
descended
in
a
direct
line
from
jesus
christ
and
his
apostles
a
church
at
the
feet
of
which
the
most
sacred
and
virtuous
elizabeth
bowed
down
her
majestic
head
and
beneath
the
shelter
of
whose
mighty
arm
the
learned
king
james
and
our
liege
prince
charles
have
reposed
their
triple
diadem
if
you
mean
this
church
i
do
say
her
sublime
ritual
should
be
enforced
till
every
fibre
of
the
king
s
dominions
yields
a
response
thereto
saints
have
worn
her
white
robe
and
her
mitre
has
rested
on
holy
men
the
sacred
water
hath
been
on
my
unworthy
head
and
therewithal
have
their
hands
signed
the
mystic
symbol
of
redemption
and
i
would
rather
continued
he
raising
the
tones
of
his
fine
manly
voice
i
would
rather
give
my
limbs
to
the
wolves
of
your
desert
than
see
her
sceptre
broken
by
men
like
yourselves
think
you
said
governor
endicott
smiling
that
king
james
cared
aught
for
the
church
save
that
he
considered
it
the
basis
of
the
throne
you
forget
his
open
declaration
in
the
assembly
at
edinburgh
the
church
of
geneva
saith
he
keepeth
pasche
and
yule
what
have
they
for
them
they
have
no
institution
as
for
our
neighbour
kirk
of
england
their
service
is
an
evil
said
mass
in
english
they
want
none
of
the
mass
but
the
liftings
king
james
had
not
then
come
to
the
english
throne
answered
brown
he
found
cause
to
alter
his
opinion
after
he
had
felt
the
blessed
influence
of
that
church
and
seen
many
of
her
corner
stones
elect
and
precious
nay
mr
brown
rejoined
the
governor
there
is
enow
wherewithal
to
convince
your
reason
for
you
are
not
wanting
in
the
light
which
leadeth
astray
that
it
was
king
craft
which
made
james
turn
his
back
upon
a
church
whereunto
he
had
given
the
name
of
the
sincerest
kirk
in
the
whole
world
and
with
all
reverence
to
his
royal
memory
i
cannot
but
think
that
his
love
of
forms
and
ceremonies
was
but
a
taint
of
hereditary
evil
from
his
moabitish
mother
forasmuch
as
i
am
a
loyal
subject
of
king
charles
it
is
neither
wise
nor
safe
for
me
to
find
specks
and
blemishes
in
his
government
but
to
my
thinking
there
is
but
a
fine
spun
thread
between
the
crosier
and
the
liturgy
the
embroidered
mantle
and
the
bishop
s
gown
and
who
does
not
know
that
the
heart
of
the
king
is
fastened
to
the
rosary
of
henrietta
maria
and
that
the
mummeries
of
rome
are
at
her
instigation
heard
within
the
palace
of
st
james
but
after
all
mr
brown
there
is
one
higher
than
princes
it
was
a
cardinal
truth
which
cardinal
pole
spake
unto
henry
the
eighth
penes
reges
inferre
bellum
penes
autem
deum
terminare
and
i
marvel
that
men
of
sense
like
yourself
governor
endicott
can
expect
the
sword
of
the
lord
to
be
quiet
in
its
scabbard
when
the
robe
of
religion
is
torn
and
her
altars
overturned
replied
brown
and
that
too
by
men
unto
whom
you
give
your
countenance
a
parcel
of
separatists
and
anabaptists
covering
their
sins
with
the
cloak
of
religion
and
concealing
their
own
factious
and
turbulent
spirit
therewith
upon
this
mr
higginson
and
mr
skelton
arose
and
made
answer
neither
as
factious
men
affecting
a
popular
parity
in
the
church
nor
as
schismatics
aiming
at
the
dissolution
of
the
church
ecclesiastical
but
as
faithful
ministers
of
christ
and
liege
subjects

towards
the
close
of
a
sultry
day
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eventful
summer
of
a
small
detachment
of
american
troops
halted
for
the
night
on
the
northern
bank
of
james
river
not
many
miles
above
williamsburg
in
virginia
it
was
one
of
those
numerous
bodies
which
issuing
from
the
main
army
under
general
la
fayette
daily
scoured
the
country
for
many
miles
in
the
vicinity
of
yorktown
where
lord
cornwallis
had
taken
post
for
the
purpose
of
intercepting
the
various
foraging
parties
of
the
enemy
this
gallant
little
band
whose
whole
force
did
not
exceed
a
hundred
and
fifty
was
led
by
a
young
french
officer
ardent
and
chivalrous
as
the
dauntless
chief
he
served
and
whose
generous
example
first
stimulated
him
as
it
had
done
thousands
of
his
countrymen
beside
to
quit
the
lilied
fields
of
france
and
lend
his
aid
to
free
oppressed
america
from
the
bonds
of
her
enslavers
their
enterprise
on
this
day
had
proved
successful
they
had
encountered
a
superior
force
and
after
a
short
but
resolute
contest
the
foe
had
seen
fit
to
retire
in
haste
and
leave
the
assailants
masters
of
the
field
the
weary
step
of
the
soldiers
evinced
how
dearly
their
laurels
had
been
won
but
every
eye
brightened
when
they
reached
the
long
wished
for
resting
place
and
the
superior
officer
gave
the
word
to
halt
in
a
few
minutes
the
bustle
of
a
camp
chased
away
the
silence
which
evening
was
gently
shedding
over
the
sequestered
spot
tents
were
pitched
arms
stacked
and
fires
kindled
with
the
haste
of
men
anxious
for
repose
some
eagerly
ran
for
water
to
the
river
some
busied
themselves
in
preparations
for
their
evening
meal
while
others
yielding
to
the
effect
of
overpowering
weariness
lay
stretched
supinely
on
the
grass
already
locked
in
sleep
or
gazing
with
listless
indolence
upon
the
movements
of
their
more
active
comrades
small
knots
of
officers
stood
here
and
there
discussing
the
events
of
the
day
though
they
gradually
dispersed
to
seek
the
luxury
of
a
bath
in
the
cool
stream
on
the
banks
of
which
they
had
encamped
for
an
hour
the
shores
of
the
james
resounded
with
gay
voices
and
bursts
of
cheerful
merriment
and
its
waters
dimpled
and
curled
left
an
undulating
track
far
behind
the
course
of
the
practised
swimmers
who
tried
their
fleetness
in
this
favourite
art
but
presently
group
after
group
retired
and
two
persons
only
remained
standing
on
the
now
silent
shore
the
elder
of
these
was
the
leader
of
the
force
which
we
have
introduced
to
the
notice
of
the
reader
he
was
just
at
that
period
of
life
when
youth
is
deepening
into
manhood
ahd
the
fine
proportions
of
his
noble
figure
the
foreign
grace
of
his
air
the
depth
of
feeling
and
of
thought
which
softened
the
eagle
brightness
of
his
eye
were
all
singularly
marked
and
attractive
his
dress
though
exhibiting
the
form
and
colours
of
the
american
uniform
was
distinguished
by
its
superior
richness
his
bearing
was
somewhat
lofty
and
when
silent
his
countenance
might
have
been
thought
to
ind
icate
a
stern
and
haughty
temper
but
when
in
conversation
or
otherwise
animated
it
was
irradiated
by
the
finest
and
most
captivating
expression
and
in
his
beaming
smile
there
was
a
magic
which
few
hearts
could
resist
at
the
moment
of
which
we
write
he
stood
with
folded
arms
and
an
air
of
deep
abstraction
upon
the
very
brink
of
the
river
watching
the
tranquil
flow
of
its
waters
tinged
vflth
the
beautiful
hues
of
twilight
and
reflecting
on
their
waveless
surface
the
glowing
heavens
and
the
verdant
banks
with
all
their
graceful
drapery
of
trees
and
overhanging
vines
a
few
paces
apart
stood
his
companion
a
gallant
boy
on
whose
cheek
health
bloomed
and
whose
ruddy
lip
was
not
yet
shaded
with
the
down
of
manhood
he
too
was
in
a
meditative
posture
but
his
attention
was
bent
upon
a
different
object
and
as
he
gazed
long
and
earnestly
upon
the
white
chimnies
of
a
large
mansion
which
appeared
at
no
great
distance
rising
from
the
midst
of
imbosoming
groves
the
brightness
of
his
eye
saddened
and
a
half
murmured
exclamation
burst
forth
with
art
impassioned
sigh
which
seemed
to
rend
his
heart
major
st
olmar
was
startled
from
his
reverie
by
the
melancholy
sound
and
bending
his
anxious
eye
upon
the
youth
how
now
my
young
lieutenant
he
exclaimed
drooping
like
yonder
water
lily
after
the
glory
of
such
a
day
a
day
which
has
wreathed
fresh
laurels
for
your
brows
and
sealed
your
right
to
be
numbered
with
the
brave
the
youth
dashed
away
a
starting
tear
and
said
as
he
turned
with
a
smile
of
affection
towards
his
friend
and
even
the
bravest
of
the
brave
may
not
deem
those
laurels
decreed
me
by
his
friendship
tarnished
though
their
leaves
sometimes
glisten
with
the
tear
unmanly
as
it
seems
which
the
remembrance
of
former
days
awakens
but
why
these
sad
remembrances
now
my
dear
edward
asked
st
olmar
one
would
think
the
events
of
this
day
of
a
nature
to
produce
only
pleasurable
emotions
and
awaken
bright
hopes
for
the
future
in
a
heart
like
yours
instead
of
calling
up
a
train
of
vain
regrets
which
have
transformed
my
gallant
soldier
to
a
tearful
girl
nay
do
not
reproach
me
said
the
youth
i
cannot
if
i
would
school
my
heart
to
forgetfuluess
yonder
pointing
to
the
mansion
which
had
excited
his
emotion
yonder
is
the
residence
of
colonel
walstein
the
abode
of
my
sister
the
scene
of
many
many
days
of
happiness
forgive
me
my
dear
leslie
said
st
olmar
grieved
that
he
should
have
treated
with
levity
his
my
master
s
theory
at
last
however
he
cut
me
short
by
d
g
his
eyes
if
he
believed
there
was
any
way
to
make
a
man
perfect
except
by
making
a
perfect
sailor
of
him
there
was
however
a
fellow
passenger
on
board
who
i
found
to
be
more
reasonable
and
less
under
the
dominion
of
the
counteracting
principles
we
had
frequent
discussions
on
the
subject
and
i
opened
to
him
all
my
plans
without
reserve
not
omitting
the
sum
of
money
i
had
with
me
to
invest
in
the
perfect
community
he
became
a
complete
convert
to
the
new
view
of
society
and
we
agreed
to
co
operate
zealously
in
the
great
work
of
perfectibility
we
went
to
live
at
the
same
lodgings
where
we
digested
a
plan
of
operations
for
the
future
the
second
day
after
landing
he
came
to
me
to
say
that
by
a
great
piece
of
ill
luck
the
merchant
on
whom
he
had
a
credit
for
a
large
sum
was
out
of
town
and
could
not
supply
him
with
funds
but
i
should
not
have
minded
that
so
much
said
he
except
that
another
merchant
to
whom
i
am
indebted
in
part
of
this
money
insists
on
my
paying
him
immediately
now
all
i
want
is
for
you
to
advance
me
the
sum
till
the
day
after
to
morrow
when
the
person
on
whom
my
bills
are
drawn
will
be
in
town
he
offered
to
show
me
the
bills
but
on
second
thoughts
had
left
them
with
the
merchant
s
clerk
the
sum
he
wanted
was
nearly
all
i
was
worth
in
the
world
but
i
lent
it
with
as
little
hesitation
as
my
friend
borrowed
it
he
then
left
me
to
go
and
pay
the
debt
he
spoke
of
desiring
me
to
have
dinner
ready
at
four
o
clock
when
he
would
certainly
be
back
but
four
came
without
my
friend
and
hour
after
hour
passed
without
his
appearing
the
dinner
grew
cold
for
i
had
no
inclination
to
eat
not
that
i
was
uneasy
about
my
money
but
my
friend
i
was
afraid
that
his
simplicity
had
been
imposed
on
or
that
like
me
he
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
mad
man
and
put
in
a
lunatic
asylum
a
week
passed
away
without
my
seeing
him
during
which
time
the
remainder
of
my
money
had
disappeared
also
i
began
to
grow
uneasy
and
one
day
took
a
solitary
walk
in
the
envrions
of
the
city
to
reflect
on
my
situation
and
ponder
on
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
my
friend
what
was
my
joy
on
turning
round
a
short
corner
to
meet
him
face
to
face
when
i
least
expected
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
but
i
cannot
say
that
he
appeared
to
share
my
raptures
my
dear
man
machine
cried
i
i
am
so
delighted
to
meet
you
again
i
was
afraid
they
had
put
you
in
a
mad
house
for
believing
in
perfectibility
by
the
way
i
have
spent
every
farthing
of
my
money
and
will
thank
you
to
let
me
have
what
i
lent
you
what
in
a
community
where
all
things
are
to
be
in
common
you
forget
the
new
view
of
society
said
he
with
a
sort
of
sneer
i
did
not
like
yes
but
the
system
you
know
is
not
yet
in
operation
no
matter
the
principles
on
which
it
is
founded
are
eternal
and
immutable
sir
if
a
community
of
goods
is
right
in
one
case
it
is
right
in
another
your
money
is
gone
you
do
nt
say
so
said
i
in
great
dismay
gone
sir
i
have
considered
myself
as
acting
up
to
the
sublime
principles
of
the
new
system
by
distributing
it
among
the
community
upon
the
just
basis
of
mutual
wants
and
mutual
conveniences
the
tailor
has
some
of
it
the
jeweller
the
hatter
the
tavern
keeper
has
each
his
share
but
the
last
guineas
went
for
a
couple
of
dozen
bingham
wine
which
would
do
your
heart
good
even
to
smell
at
you
shall
come
this
blessed
day
and
help
crack
a
bottle
hey
my
fine
piece
of
perfectibility
so
then
you
have
spent
all
my
money
your
money
my
dear
friend
you
again
forget
the
sublime
doctrines
of
the
new
system
of
society
you
have
only
to
consider
each
of
these
persons
who
have
received
a
share
of
your
money
as
members
of
our
community
and
you
will
acknowledge
that
it
could
not
possibly
belong
to
you
i
believe
you
are
a
great
rascal
my
dear
friend
how
can
you
make
that
out
you
have
cheated
me
of
my
money
my
good
friend
you
are
certainly
under
the
dominion
of
the
counteracting
principles
if
ever
a
man
was
in
this
world
but
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
had
defrauded
you
of
your
money
what
then
am
i
to
blame
who
else
in
the
name
of
common
sense
do
nt
mention
common
sense
i
beseech
you
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
new
system
of
society
we
must
try
the
question
by
our
great
master
s
first
principles
agreed
well
then
can
you
deny
that
all
the
errors
inconsistencies
and
crimes
of
the
man
machine
for
the
last
six
thousand
years
may
be
traced
in
a
direct
line
to
the
absurd
and
mischievous
system
of
education
which
has
prevailed
all
that
time
no
very
well
and
can
you
deny
the
immortal
and
immutable
truth
of
the
great
principle
of
perfectibility
that
no
man
can
be
justly
held
responsible
for
his
opinions
or
his
actions
i
do
not
deny
it
very
well
then
answer
me
thou
ricketty
addle
pated
imperfect
machine
whether
even
supposing
i
had
actually
defrauded
you
of
your
money
i
am
to
be
blamed
for
it
you
must
blame
the
erroneous
system
of
society
and
if
you
punish
any
body
it
must
be
my
parents
who
did
not
take
sufficient
care
to
put
down
the
rascally
counteracting
principles
and
you
think
yourself
to

stopped
a
few
paces
from
the
spot
which
lucie
had
just
quitted
and
leaning
against
a
tree
appeared
so
entirely
absorbed
by
his
own
reflections
that
de
valette
for
some
moments
hesitated
to
address
him
the
rapid
mutations
of
his
countenance
still
betrayed
a
powerful
mental
struggle
and
de
valette
felt
his
curiosity
and
interest
strongly
awakened
by
the
sudden
and
uncontrollable
excitement
of
one
whose
usually
cold
and
abstracted
air
shewed
little
sympathy
with
the
concerns
of
humanity
gradually
however
his
features
resumed
their
accustomed
calmness
but
on
raising
his
eyes
and
meeting
the
inquiring
gaze
of
de
valette
he
drooped
his
head
as
if
ashamed
to
have
betrayed
emotions
so
inconsistent
with
the
vow
which
professed
to
raise
him
above
the
influence
of
all
worldly
passions
i
fear
you
are
ill
father
said
de
valette
approaching
him
with
kindness
can
i
do
anything
to
assist
or
relieve
you
i
was
ill
my
son
he
replied
but
it
is
over
now
passed
away
like
a
troubled
phantasy
which
visits
the
weary
and
restless
slumberer
and
flies
at
the
approach
of
returning
reason
your
language
is
figurative
returned
de
valette
and
implies
the
sufferance
of
mental
rather
than
bodily
pain
if
such
is
your
unhappy
state
i
know
full
well
that
human
skill
is
unavailing
what
know
you
of
pain
asked
the
priest
with
startling
energy
you
who
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
fortune
s
smile
whose
days
are
one
ceaseless
round
of
careless
gaiety
whose
repose
is
yet
unbroken
by
the
gnawing
worm
of
never
dying
repentance
such
too
i
was
in
the
spring
time
of
my
life
i
drained
the
cup
of
pleasure
but
misery
and
disappointment
were
in
its
dregs
i
yielded
to
the
follies
and
passions
of
my
youthful
heart
and
the
sting
of
remorse
and
ceaseless
regret
have
entered
my
inmost
soul
pardon
me
father
said
de
valette
if
i
have
unconsciously
awakened
thoughts
which
time
perchance
had
well
nigh
soothed
into
forgetfulness
awakened
thoughts
the
priest
repeated
in
a
melancholy
voice
they
can
never
never
sleep
repentance
cannot
obliterate
them
years
of
penance
fastings
and
vigils
and
wanderings
cannot
wear
them
from
my
remembrance
look
at
me
my
son
and
may
this
decaying
frame
which
time
might
yet
have
spared
teach
thee
the
vanity
of
human
hopes
and
lead
thee
to
resist
the
impulses
of
passion
and
to
mistrust
and
regulate
even
the
virtuous
inclinations
of
thy
heart
your
words
will
be
long
remembered
father
said
de
valette
touched
by
the
sorrow
of
the
venerable
man
and
may
the
good
saints
restore
peace
and
hope
to
your
wounded
spirit
and
may
heaven
bless
you
my
son
and
preserve
you
from
those
fatal
errors
which
have
wrecked
my
peace
and
withered
the
fairest
hopes
that
ever
blossomed
on
the
tree
of
earthly
happiness
go
now
he
added
in
a
firmer
tone
forget
this
interview
if
possible
and
when
we
meet
again
think
not
of
what
you
have
now
heard
and
witnessed
but
see
in
me
only
the
humble
missionary
of
the
church
who
till
this
day
his
voice
again
trembled
till
she
crossed
my
path
she
interrupted
de
valette
do
you
mean
mademoiselle
de
courcy
de
courcy
repeated
the
priest
grasping
the
arm
of
eustace
while
the
paleness
of
death
overspread
his
features
who
bears
that
most
unhappy
name
the
niece
of
mad
de
la
tour
returned
de
valette
and
however
unfortunate
the
name
it
has
as
yet
entailed
no
evil
on
its
present
possessor
was
it
she
whom
i
just
now
saw
with
you
asked
the
priest
with
increasing
agitation
it
was
and
pardon
me
father
your
vehemence
has
already
greatly
alarmed
her
i
meant
it
not
he
replied
but
i
will
not
meet
her
again
no
i
dare
not
look
again
upon
that
face
has
she
parents
young
man
he
continued
after
a
brief
pause
she
has
been
an
orphan
from
infancy
replied
de
valette
and
mad
de
la
tour
is
almost
the
only
relative
whom
she
claims
on
earth
she
is
a
protestant
said
father
gilbert
inquiringly
she
is
said
de
valette
though
her
parents
i
have
heard
were
catholics
and
lucie
has
herself
told
me
that
in
her
early
childhood
she
was
instructed
in
that
faith
lucie
muttered
the
priest
to
himself
as
if
unconscious
of
another
s
presence
and
that
name
too
but
no
she
was
not
left
among
the
enemies
of
our
faith
it
is
a
strange
an
idle
dream
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
remained
several
moments
apparently
in
deep
musing
and
when
he
again
looked
up
every
trace
of
emotion
was
gone
though
a
shade
of
melancholy
deeper
even
than
usual
had
settled
on
his
features
go
he
said
to
de
valette
and
betray
not
the
weakness
you
have
witnessed
go
in
peace
and
forget
even
to
pity
me
father
gilbert
s
manner
was
too
imposing
to
be
disputed
and
de
valette
left
him
with
silent
reverence
perplexed
by
the
mystery
of
his
words
and
the
singularity
of
his
conduct
before
he
reached
the
house
however
he
had
convinced
himself
that
the
priest
was
not
perfectly
sane
and
that
some
fancied
resemblance
had
touched
the
chords
of
memory
and
revived
the
fading
images
of
early
and
perhaps
unhappy
days
this
appeared
to
him
the
only
rational
way
to
account
for
his
eccentricity
and
under
this
impression
as
well
as
from
the
priest
s
injunction
he
resolved
not
to
mention
the
interview
and
conversation
to
any
person
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
conceal
it
from
lucie
whose
apprehensions
might
be
increased
by
the
account
and
in
a
short
time
indeed
with
the
lightness
of
an
unreflecting
disposition
a
circumstance
which
had
at
the
the
lamp
that
hugh
crombie
held
but
dimly
enlightened
them
and
the
number
and
contiguity
of
the
doors
caused
dr
melmoth
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
wrong
one
not
there
not
there
doctor
it
is
dame
crombie
s
bedchamber
shouted
hugh
most
energetically
now
beelzebub
defend
me
he
muttered
to
himself
perceiving
that
his
exclamation
had
been
a
moment
too
late
heavens
what
do
i
see
ejaculated
dr
melmoth
lifting
his
hands
and
starting
back
from
the
entrance
of
the
room
the
three
students
pressed
forward
mrs
crombie
and
the
servant
girl
had
been
drawn
to
the
spot
by
the
sound
of
hugh
s
voice
and
all
their
wondering
eyes
were
fixed
on
poor
ellen
langton
the
apartment
in
the
midst
of
which
she
stood
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
solitary
candle
at
the
farther
extremity
but
ellen
was
exposed
to
the
glare
of
the
three
lamps
held
by
hugh
his
wife
and
the
servant
girl
their
combined
rays
seemed
to
form
a
focus
exactly
at
the
point
where
they
reached
her
and
the
beholders
had
any
been
sufficiently
calm
might
have
watched
her
features
in
their
agitated
workings
and
frequent
change
of
expression
as
perfectly
as
by
the
broad
light
of
day
terror
had
at
first
blanched
her
as
white
as
a
lily
or
as
a
marble
statue
which
for
a
moment
she
resembled
as
she
stood
motionless
in
the
centre
of
the
room
shame
next
bore
sway
and
her
blushing
countenance
covered
by
her
slender
white
fingers
might
fantastically
be
compared
to
a
variegated
rose
with
its
alternate
stripes
of
white
and
red
the
next
instant
a
sense
of
her
pure
and
innocent
intentions
gave
her
strength
and
courage
and
her
attitude
and
look
had
now
something
of
pride
and
dignity
these
however
in
their
turn
gave
way
for
edward
walcott
pressed
forward
and
attempted
to
address
her
ellen
ellen
he
said
in
an
agitated
and
quivering
whisper
but
what
was
to
follow
cannot
be
known
for
his
emotion
checked
his
utterance
his
tone
and
look
however
again
overcame
ellen
langton
and
she
burst
into
tears
fanshawe
advanced
and
took
edward
s
arm
she
has
been
deceived
he
whispered
she
is
innocent
you
are
unworthy
of
her
if
you
doubt
it
why
do
you
interfere
sir
demanded
edward
whose
passions
thoroughly
excited
would
willingly
have
wreaked
themselves
on
any
one
what
right
have
you
to
speak
of
her
innocence
perhaps
he
continued
an
undefined
and
ridiculous
suspicion
arising
in
his
mind
perhaps
you
are
acquainted
with
her
intentions
perhaps
you
are
the
deceiver
fanshawe
s
temper
was
not
naturally
of
the
meekest
character
and
having
had
a
thousand
bitter
feelings
of
his
own
to
overcome
before
he
could
attempt
to
console
edward
this
rude
repulse
had
almost
aroused
him
to
fierceness
but
his
pride
of
which
a
more
moderate
degree
would
have
had
a
less
peaceable
effect
came
to
his
assistance
and
he
turned
calmly
and
contemptuously
away
ellen
in
the
mean
time
had
been
restored
to
some
degree
of
composure
to
this
effect
a
feeling
of
pique
against
edward
walcott
had
contributed
she
had
distinguished
his
voice
in
the
neighboring
apartment
had
heard
his
mirth
and
wild
laughter
without
being
aware
of
the
state
of
feeling
that
produced
them
she
had
supposed
that
the
terms
on
which
they
parted
in
the
morning
which
had
been
very
grievous
to
herself
would
have
produced
a
corresponding
sadness
in
him
but
while
she
sat
in
loneliness
and
in
tears
her
bosom
distracted
by
a
thousand
anxieties
and
sorrows
of
many
of
which
edward
was
the
object
his
reckless
gayety
had
seemed
to
prove
the
slight
regard
in
which
he
held
her
after
the
first
outbreak
of
emotion
therefore
she
called
up
her
pride
of
which
on
proper
occasions
she
had
a
reasonable
share
and
sustained
his
upbraiding
glance
with
a
passive
composure
which
women
have
more
readily
at
command
than
men
dr
melmoth
s
surprise
had
during
this
time
kept
him
silent
and
inactive
he
gazed
alternately
from
one
to
another
of
those
who
stood
around
him
as
if
to
seek
some
explanation
of
so
strange
an
event
but
the
faces
of
all
were
as
perplexed
as
his
own
even
hugh
crombie
had
assumed
a
look
of
speechless
wonder
speechless
because
his
imagination
prolific
as
it
was
could
not
supply
a
plausible
falsehood
ellen
dearest
child
at
length
said
the
doctor
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
ellen
endeavored
to
reply
but
as
her
composure
was
merely
external
she
was
unable
to
render
her
words
audible
fanshawe
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
dr
melmoth
who
appeared
grateful
for
his
advice
true
it
will
be
the
better
way
he
replied
my
wits
are
utterly
confounded
or
i
should
not
have
remained
thus
long
come
my
dear
child
he
continued
advancing
to
ellen
and
taking
her
hand
let
us
return
home
and
defer
the
explanation
till
the
morrow
there
there
only
dry
your
eyes
and
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
and
that
will
be
your
wisest
way
old
gentleman
muttered
hugh
crombie
ellen
at
first
exhibited
but
little
desire
or
rather
an
evident
reluctance
to
accompany
her
guardian
she
hung
back
while
her
glance
passed
almost
imperceptibly
over
the
faces
that
gazed
so
eagerly
at
her
but
the
one
she
sought
was
not
visible
among
them
she
had
no
alternative
and
suffered
herself
to
be
led
from
the
inn
edward
walcott
alone
remained
behind
the
most
wretched
being
at
least
such
was
his
own
opinion
that
breathed
the
vital
air
he
felt
a
sinking
and
sickness
of
the
heart
and
alternately
a
feverish
frenzy
neither
of
which
his
short
and
cloudless
existence
had
heretofore
occasioned
him
to
experience
he
was
jealous
of
he
knew
not
whom
and
he
knew
not
what
he
was
ungenerous
enough
to
believe
that
ellen
his
pure
and
lovely
ellen
had
degraded
herself
though
from
what
motive
or
by
whose
agency
he
could
not
conjecture
when
dr
melmoth
had
taken
her
in
charge
edward
for
a
moment
to
pass
over
the
brow
of
mrs
mason
a
paleness
as
of
death
and
a
burst
of
tears
from
the
daughter
showed
the
light
in
which
she
considered
the
most
distant
prospect
of
getting
rid
of
their
difficulties
in
that
way
it
was
settled
that
they
would
deliberate
no
further
upon
the
subject
until
future
difficulties
called
upon
them
to
act
chapter
v
despise
not
the
poor
because
he
is
poor
whenever
the
question
of
the
future
course
of
the
family
was
in
discussion
and
whenever
the
investigation
was
followed
by
gloom
and
despondency
george
never
failed
to
ply
his
father
s
motto
and
to
dwell
upon
his
last
declaration
that
god
never
forsakes
them
who
do
not
forsake
themselves
they
were
in
health
he
said
and
in
a
country
where
sustenance
was
easy
to
be
procured
and
if
they
could
only
hit
upon
the
right
way
some
one
might
surely
be
devised
in
which
they
might
become
independent
of
hercules
pindall
and
every
body
and
take
care
of
themselves
the
grand
burden
of
their
conversations
was
to
search
for
this
way
the
inquirer
after
the
secret
of
perpetual
motion
the
chemist
inquiring
after
the
transmuting
secret
that
will
turn
lead
to
gold
the
student
whipping
up
his
powers
to
put
the
finish
to
an
invention
that
will
bring
him
fame
and
fortune
know
but
little
of
the
heart
wearing
study
of
this
family
to
start
in
some
track
by
which
they
might
obtain
sufficient
money
to
clothe
the
family
and
pay
the
doctor
s
bill
and
the
taxes
destitute
as
they
were
these
bills
were
presented
and
payment
pressed
with
persevering
importunity
in
discoursing
every
evening
upon
this
theme
madam
mason
george
and
eliza
were
of
course
the
chief
speakers
though
henry
thomas
and
william
often
made
their
speech
and
threw
their
light
upon
the
subject
these
discussions
were
pursued
with
the
more
earnestness
and
interest
inasmuch
as
the
speakers
considered
themselves
urged
to
these
inquiries
by
the
mournful
consideration
that
in
so
doing
they
were
fulfilling
the
last
wish
and
charge
of
their
deceased
head
his
spirit
was
considered
as
one
of
the
number
still
pressing
the
grand
maxim
of
his
life
never
to
despond
and
urging
them
to
task
their
inventive
powers
to
the
utmost
to
find
some
branch
of
industry
in
pursuing
which
they
might
obtain
a
decent
livelihood
if
the
reader
would
not
have
felt
a
smile
out
of
place
in
this
family
he
could
not
have
restrained
a
smile
at
hearing
some
of
the
propositions
of
the
junior
members
of
this
singular
debating
society
henry
proposed
the
mystery
of
bird
catching
and
sending
cages
of
mocking
birds
red
birds
parroquets
and
turtle
doves
to
new
orleans
for
sale
thomas
was
for
applying
their
exertions
to
the
gathering
reed
canes
and
sending
them
to
the
northern
manufacturers
for
weavers
sleys
george
had
high
hopes
from
a
chemical
composition
for
ink
and
blacking
which
he
expected
to
complete
from
the
vegetables
of
the
country
mrs
mason
and
eliza
limited
their
projects
to
the
tried
and
simple
experiment
of
raising
cotton
and
spinning
night
and
day
to
clothe
themselves
and
manufacture
a
little
surplus
for
sale
a
thousand
inconveniences
attended
every
experiment
as
preliminary
difficulties
the
proposer
was
generally
overwhelmed
by
the
objections
of
the
next
speaker
one
project
was
abandoned
to
find
difficulties
equally
insuperable
appended
to
another
night
after
night
and
week
after
week
wore
away
in
the
unprofitable
speculations
of
theory
the
debating
society
generally
retired
from
the
evening
fire
to
their
beds
their
brain
dry
and
exhausted
by
useless
reaching
for
some
practicable
project
and
their
hearts
sunk
with
the
discouraging
impression
that
nothing
was
before
them
but
the
same
hopeless
poverty
but
when
their
supper
of
milk
corn
bread
and
sweet
potatoes
was
finished
and
they
were
again
assembled
about
the
evening
fire
the
repetition
of
the
ancient
maxim
never
despair
like
a
voice
from
heaven
renewed
their
courage
and
strength
for
a
new
discussion
success
as
it
ought
ultimately
attended
these
counsels
the
post
master
on
the
bank
of
the
river
had
noticed
george
and
had
inquired
into
the
circumstances
and
character
of
the
family
he
was
a
man
who
had
both
understanding
and
a
heart
he
never
it
is
true
had
proposed
to
himself
to
be
a
mecnas
or
to
establish
a
manufacturing
village
but
if
we
could
know
all
the
good
thoughts
that
pass
in
the
minds
of
humble
and
undistinguished
people
who
expect
neither
notoriety
nor
advantage
from
those
thoughts
we
could
not
but
think
better
of
the
species
and
human
nature
while
this
family
was
wearying
itself
in
fruitless
attempts
to
invent
some
kind
of
pursuit
in
which
to
employ
their
industry
he
had
more
than
once
been
occupied
in
the
benevolent
desire
to
be
useful
to
them
as
a
foretaste
of
good
will
to
them
he
was
in
the
habit
of
sending
george
the
newspapers
and
pamphlets
that
came
to
his
office
after
he
had
perused
them
these
were
beneficial
to
them
in
a
hundred
ways
they
taught
the
children
to
read
in
an
imperfect
degree
they
supplied
the
want
of
books
they
learned
from
them
the
events
passions
and
employments
of
the
great
world
the
thousand
projects
and
discoveries
of
manufacturing
inventiveness
were
brought
to
their
view
they
could
thus
trace
the
range
of
other
minds
in
the
same
inquiries
which
themselves
were
pursuing
with
so
much
interest
among
other
inventions
in
manufactures
they
noted
with
keen
interest
that
the
town
from
which
they
had
emigrated
had
become
famous
for
the
manufacture
of
a
new
kind
of
grass
bonners
in
imitation
of
leghorn
straw
a
premium
of
fifty
dollars
had
been
obtained
by
a
school
mate
of
eliza
s
for
a
bonnet
of
this
kind
which
had
sold
for
thirty
dollars
beside
eighty
dollars
for
a
single
bonnet
and
that
made
by
a
girl
neither
older
nor
more
ingenious
than
herself
in
fact
the
whole
family
from
constantly
seeing
the
manufacture
going
were
exceedingly
imprudent
to
make
such
engagements
do
not
however
delay
any
longer
the
explanation
of
this
mystery
you
know
then
mother
continued
lucy
with
a
slight
embarrassment
in
her
manner
jane
s
home
is
situated
so
far
out
of
the
village
that
the
path
through
the
woods
is
almost
as
direct
as
this
i
have
always
chosen
it
because
it
is
far
more
quiet
and
pleasant
i
mean
always
till
of
late
and
why
have
you
abandoned
it
of
late
said
her
mother
because
i
had
reason
to
believe
it
was
a
favorite
place
of
resort
to
the
gentleman
we
were
speaking
of
i
had
twice
met
him
there
as
i
supposed
by
accident
but
jane
grant
soon
after
found
in
our
little
bower
a
copy
of
french
verses
which
i
knew
he
must
have
dropped
and
i
cannot
think
it
was
entirely
accidental
for
my
own
name
was
upon
them
and
what
were
they
said
mrs
everett
hastily
could
you
read
them
lucy
i
could
and
i
rejoiced
for
once
that
jane
knew
nothing
of
the
language
in
which
they
were
written
the
words
were
beautiful
but
they
were
not
true
for
they
spoke
of
a
being
as
sinless
and
lovely
as
the
angels
of
heaven
and
gave
to
it
the
name
of
a
frail
and
erring
mortal
until
last
evening
i
have
never
since
walked
through
the
woods
and
why
did
you
then
jane
was
to
accompany
me
part
of
the
way
and
she
insisted
upon
taking
the
forest
path
i
dared
not
tell
her
my
scruples
neither
did
i
think
it
at
all
probable
that
at
this
hour
i
should
again
meet
the
stranger
jane
parted
with
me
on
the
chestnut
knoll
and
just
as
she
was
quite
hidden
from
sight
among
the
trees
on
turning
my
head
to
the
little
arbor
we
had
fitted
up
for
our
own
accommodation
i
beheld
the
stranger
himself
he
was
standing
just
in
the
edge
of
it
it
was
the
third
time
we
had
met
precisely
in
the
same
place
i
would
have
turned
but
i
saw
that
his
eye
was
upon
me
and
knew
myself
to
be
just
in
the
center
of
the
woods
so
i
moved
on
with
a
quickened
pace
without
once
averting
my
eye
from
the
path
until
i
had
nearly
reached
the
edge
of
the
thicket
being
exceedingly
fatigued
i
now
began
to
move
slower
and
it
was
well
that
i
did
for
some
time
i
had
perceived
before
me
a
singular
object
lying
a
little
on
one
side
of
the
path
as
i
drew
near
my
curiosity
increased
and
i
was
turning
aside
a
moment
to
satisfy
it
when
a
slight
movement
in
the
adjoining
bushes
arrested
my
steps
do
you
wonder
dear
mother
that
my
blood
ran
cold
with
horror
when
i
found
myself
standing
within
a
few
feet
of
a
sleeping
indian
a
warrior
too
and
armed
with
tomahawk
and
arrows
mrs
everett
threw
her
arm
around
her
child
as
if
seeking
to
protect
her
from
the
threatened
danger
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
we
must
go
home
lucy
she
coutinued
it
is
no
time
to
be
walking
now
and
she
drew
her
daughter
s
arm
in
her
s
as
they
moved
hastily
towards
the
gate
of
the
cottage
it
was
quite
dark
when
they
had
reached
the
porch
and
it
was
not
until
mrs
everett
had
closely
locked
and
barred
the
outer
door
that
lucy
found
opportunity
to
renew
her
narrative
i
was
just
hesitating
what
to
do
she
continued
in
reply
to
her
mother
s
inquiries
when
the
sound
of
distant
voices
met
my
ear
they
seemed
rapidly
approaching
retreat
was
impossible
if
they
were
foes
my
only
security
lay
in
concealment
mother
have
you
ever
noticed
the
hollow
oak
that
stands
to
the
right
of
the
path
just
as
you
enter
the
valley
of
wild
flowers
yes
yes
go
on
said
mrs
everett
with
impatience
it
was
only
a
few
rods
behind
me
continued
lucy
and
i
was
soon
concealed
within
it
the
voices
had
all
the
time
been
approaching
and
were
now
so
near
that
i
could
distinctly
distinguish
their
words
i
was
surprised
too
to
perceive
that
they
spoke
in
french
and
who
were
they
lucy
and
what
did
they
say
inquired
mrs
everett
whose
interest
in
the
narrative
had
every
moment
increased
who
they
were
mother
i
do
not
know
replied
lucy
but
as
to
their
words
i
remember
them
as
distinctly
as
though
i
had
but
this
moment
heard
them
hertel
de
rouville
said
the
first
voice
he
is
a
noble
and
gallant
youth
we
should
be
well
convinced
that
he
is
a
traitor
ere
we
come
to
such
desperate
measures
and
what
do
you
call
noble
and
gallant
exclaimed
the
other
and
rougher
tone
if
to
betray
to
the
enemy
the
counsels
of
his
party
is
noble
i
grant
you
that
he
is
so
if
to
fold
up
his
arms
and
sit
down
in
the
camp
of
the
foe
is
gallant
i
grant
you
he
is
a
gallant
youth
but
de
rouville
continued
the
first
voice
what
proof
have
you
that
he
has
betrayed
our
counsels
i
thought
that
vandreuil
himself
despatched
him
to
the
enemy
as
a
spy
not
as
a
traitor
replied
the
other
his
orders
were
to
go
from
one
end
of
new
england
to
the
other
to
seek
its
weak
and
defenceless
points
of
attack
to
reconnoitre
its
strong
places
and
see
where
the
ambushed
foe
might
best
hide
themselves
and
vandreuil
is
informed
that
he
lingers
here
to
obtain
an
opportunity
of
opening
our
plans
to
the
governor
at
all
events
he
continued
in
a
lower
tone
vandreuil
assures
me
that
a
little
of
this
same
gallant
s
blood
will
contribute
materially
to
the
betterment
of
our
cause
that
is
if
secretly
drawn
and
hertel
de
rouville
is
not
the
man
who
hesitates
at
his
bidding
but
if
you
have
any
scruples
beaumont
he
added
let
it
not
if
it
lives
curse
the
mother
for
the
boon
of
a
life
which
its
fellows
must
despise
and
speak
of
with
scorn
and
ignominy
i
stood
even
this
appeal
my
heart
was
steeled
within
me
and
though
i
spoke
to
her
less
harshly
i
spoke
as
hypocritically
as
ever
she
saw
through
the
thin
veil
which
i
had
deemed
it
necessary
to
throw
over
my
dishonesty
and
a
new
expression
took
the
place
of
tenderness
in
her
features
it
is
all
true
then
as
they
have
said
she
exclaimed
passionately
now
o
god
do
i
feel
my
infirmity
now
do
i
know
my
sin
and
this
is
the
creature
i
have
loved
this
is
the
thing
wanting
in
the
heart
to
feel
and
mean
enough
in
soul
to
utter
falsehood
and
prevaricate
this
is
the
creature
for
whom
i
have
sacrificed
my
heart
for
whom
i
have
given
up
hopelessly
and
haplessly
my
own
soul
oh
wretched
fool
oh
miserable
most
miserable
folly
yet
think
not
and
as
she
turned
upon
me
she
looked
like
the
priestess
upon
the
tripod
influenced
with
inspiration
think
not
mean
traitor
as
thou
art
think
not
to
triumph
in
thy
farther
seduction
me
thou
hast
destroyed
i
am
thy
victim
and
i
feel
the
doom
already
but
thou
shalt
go
no
farther
in
thy
way
i
will
seek
out
this
lady
for
whose
more
attractive
person
mine
and
my
honor
and
affections
alike
are
to
be
sacrificed
she
shall
hear
from
me
all
the
truth
she
shall
know
whether
it
be
compatible
with
her
honor
and
happiness
or
the
dignity
of
her
character
to
unite
herself
in
such
bonds
with
a
man
who
has
proved
so
deadly
so
dishonorable
to
her
sex
and
oh
god
she
exclaimed
sinking
fervently
on
her
knee
if
it
shall
so
happen
that
i
save
one
such
as
i
from
such
a
folly
as
mine
may
it
not
expiate
in
thy
sight
some
portion
of
the
sad
offence
of
which
i
have
been
guilty
she
rose
firmly
and
without
a
tear
her
eyes
were
red
her
cheeks
were
burning
with
the
fever
of
her
whole
frame
and
she
seemed
in
all
respects
the
embodiment
of
a
divine
a
glorious
inspiration
i
was
awed
i
was
alarmed
i
had
never
before
seen
her
exhibit
any
thing
like
daring
or
firmness
of
purpose
she
was
now
the
striking
personification
of
both
she
approached
and
sought
to
pass
by
me
i
seized
her
hand
she
withdrew
it
quickly
and
indignantly
begone
she
exclaimed
i
scorn
i
despise
you
think
not
to
keep
me
back
you
have
brought
death
and
shame
among
my
people
in
devoting
me
to
both
you
shall
pollute
me
no
more
nay
speak
not
no
more
falsehood
no
more
falsehood
for
your
own
soul
s
sake
i
would
not
that
you
should
seem
meaner
in
my
sight
than
you
already
are
i
seized
her
hand
and
retained
it
by
a
fierce
grasp
emily
i
exclaimed
what
would
you
do
why
is
this
i
ask
but
for
delay
give
me
but
a
month
and
all
will
be
well
you
shall
then
have
what
you
ask
you
shall
then
be
satisfied
false
false
these
assurances
sir
deceive
me
not
now
they
deceive
me
no
more
my
hope
is
gone
forever
gone
that
you
will
do
me
justice
i
see
through
your
hypocrisy
i
know
all
your
villainy
and
constance
claiborne
shall
know
it
too
ha
do
you
start
when
her
name
is
but
mentioned
think
you
i
know
it
not
all
know
i
not
that
you
have
been
bought
with
money
that
vile
and
mercenary
as
you
are
you
have
not
only
sold
me
and
this
unborn
pledge
of
your
dishonesty
and
my
dishonor
but
you
have
sold
yourself
seek
not
to
keep
me
back
she
shall
hear
it
all
from
these
lips
that
thenceafter
shall
forever
more
be
silent
she
struggled
to
free
herself
from
my
grasp
and
endeavored
to
pass
by
me
with
a
desperate
effort
her
strength
was
opposed
to
mine
and
in
the
heat
of
the
struggle
i
forgot
that
victory
in
such
a
contest
would
be
the
heaviest
shame
yet
i
only
sought
at
first
to
arrest
her
progress
as
i
live
i
had
then
no
other
object
beyond
i
certainly
did
not
intend
violence
far
less
further
crime
but
the
fate
was
upon
me
she
persisted
in
her
design
and
in
the
effort
to
prevent
her
passage
i
hurled
her
to
the
ground
i
paused
in
a
deadly
stupor
after
this
i
was
no
longer
a
reasoning
a
conscious
being
she
looked
up
to
me
imploringly
the
desperate
feeling
which
heretofore
had
nerved
and
strengthened
her
seemed
utterly
to
have
departed
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
at
that
moment
she
would
have
obeyed
as
i
commanded
she
would
have
yielded
to
all
my
requisitions
she
would
have
been
my
slave
she
met
no
answering
gentleness
in
my
eyes
and
with
a
choking
and
vain
effort
at
speech
she
turned
her
face
despairingly
upon
the
still
dewy
grass
and
sobbed
as
if
the
strings
of
her
heart
were
breaking
in
unison
with
each
convulsion
of
her
breast
at
that
moment
i
know
not
what
demon
possessed
me
there
was
a
dead
a
more
than
customary
silence
in
all
things
around
me
i
felt
a
fury
within
me
a
clamorous
anxiety
about
my
heart
a
gnawing
something
that
would
not
sleep
and
could
not
be
silent
and
without
a
thought
of
what
i
was
to
do
or
what
had
been
done
i
knelt
down
beside
her
my
eyes
wandered
wildly
around
the
forest
but
at
length
invariably
settled
in
the
end
upon
her
there
was
an
instinct
in
all
this
she
had
the
look
of
an
enemy
to
the
secret
and
impelling
nature
within
me
and
without
uttering
a
single
word
my
fingers
with
an
infernal
gripe
were
upon
her
throat
she
could
not
now
doubt
the
desperate
character
of
my
design
the
house
of
skulls
was
indeed
menacing
that
enormous
pyramid
which
don
amador
had
surveyed
with
awe
in
the
gloom
of
evening
was
now
concealed
under
a
more
impressive
veil
it
was
invested
and
darkened
by
a
cloud
of
human
beings
which
surged
over
its
vast
summit
and
rolled
along
its
huge
sides
like
a
living
storm
the
great
court
that
surrounded
it
was
also
filled
with
barbarians
for
though
the
coatepantli
or
wall
of
serpents
with
its
monstrous
battlements
and
gloomy
towers
concealed
them
from
the
eye
there
came
such
a
hum
of
voices
from
behind
as
could
not
have
been
produced
alone
even
by
the
myriads
that
covered
the
temple
in
addition
to
these
the
great
square
itself
was
alive
with
mexicans
and
the
sudden
sight
of
them
brought
a
thrill
of
alarm
into
the
heart
of
the
bravest
cavalier
the
people
of
tenochtitlan
thus
as
it
were
hunted
by
their
invaders
even
to
their
sanctuaries
turned
upon
them
with
frowns
yet
parted
away
from
before
them
in
deep
silence
nevertheless
at
this
spectacle
the
christians
came
to
an
immediate
stand
in
doubt
whether
to
entangle
themselves
further
or
to
take
counsel
of
their
fears
and
retreat
without
delay
to
their
quarters
while
they
stood
yet
hesitating
and
in
some
confusion
suddenly
and
with
a
tone
that
pierced
to
their
inmost
souls
there
came
a
horrid
shriek
from
the
top
of
the
pyramid
and
fifty
castilian
voices
exclaimed
a
sacrifice
a
human
sacrifice
and
under
the
cross
of
christ
that
we
raised
on
the
temple
the
place
of
god
is
defiled
by
the
rites
of
hell
cried
cortes
furiously
his
apprehensions
vanishing
at
once
before
his
fanaticism
set
on
and
avenge
couch
your
lances
draw
your
swords
and
if
any
resist
call
on
god
and
slay
so
saying
he
drew
his
sword
spurred
his
dun
steed
and
rushed
towards
the
temple
the
half
naked
herds
fled
yelling
away
from
the
infuriated
christian
opening
him
a
free
path
to
the
walls
and
had
that
fearful
cry
been
repeated
there
is
no
doubt
he
would
have
led
his
followers
even
within
the
coatepantli
though
at
the
risk
of
irretrievable
and
universal
destruction
before
however
he
had
yet
reached
the
wall
he
had
time
for
reflection
and
though
greatly
excited
he
could
no
longer
conceal
from
himself
the
consequences
of
provoking
the
pagans
at
their
very
temple
and
during
the
worship
of
their
god
he
was
at
this
moment
well
befriended
and
numerously
indeed
but
at
a
distance
from
the
garrison
without
cannon
and
almost
without
musketry
surrounded
by
enemies
whom
the
eye
could
not
number
and
who
had
not
feared
to
assail
him
even
when
fortified
in
a
situation
almost
impregnable
and
assisted
by
three
times
his
present
force
as
well
as
several
thousand
bold
tlascalans
and
in
addition
to
all
these
disadvantages
there
came
neither
such
sound
of
trumpet
nor
such
distant
commotion
among
the
indians
as
might
admonish
him
of
the
approach
of
sandoval
he
checked
his
horse
and
waving
to
his
followers
to
halt
again
cast
his
eyes
around
on
the
multitude
as
if
to
determine
in
what
manner
to
begin
his
retreat
for
he
felt
that
this
measure
could
be
no
longer
delayed
the
mexicans
gazed
upon
him
with
angry
visages
but
still
in
silence
not
an
arm
was
yet
raised
and
they
seemed
prepared
to
give
him
passage
whichever
way
he
might
choose
to
direct
his
course
while
hesitating
an
instant
don
hernan
perceived
a
stir
among
the
crowds
close
under
the
wall
of
serpents
accompanied
by
a
low
but
general
murmur
of
voices
and
immediately
the
eyes
of
the
pagans
were
turned
from
him
towards
the
coatepantli
as
if
to
catch
a
view
of
some
sight
still
more
attractive
and
important
his
first
thought
was
that
these
movements
indicated
the
sudden
presence
of
sandoval
and
his
party
a
conceit
that
was
however
immediately
put
to
flight
by
the
events
which
ensued
the
murmurs
of
the
multitude
were
soon
stilled
and
the
pagans
that
covered
the
pyramid
were
seen
to
cast
their
eyes
earnestly
down
to
the
square
as
the
sound
of
many
flutes
and
other
soft
wind
instruments
rose
on
the
air
and
crept
not
unmusically
along
the
wall
of
serpents
and
thence
to
the
ears
of
the
spaniards
before
these
had
yet
time
to
express
their
wonder
at
the
presence
of
such
peaceful
music
amidst
a
scene
of
war
and
sacrifice
the
crowds
slowly
parted
asunder
and
they
plainly
beheld
for
the
mexicans
had
opened
a
wide
vista
to
the
principal
gate
a
procession
seemingly
of
little
children
clad
in
white
garments
waving
pots
of
incense
conducted
by
priests
in
gowns
of
black
and
flame
colour
and
headed
by
musicians
and
men
bearing
little
flags
issue
from
the
throng
and
bend
their
steps
towards
the
savage
portal
in
the
centre
of
the
train
on
a
sort
of
litter
very
rich
and
gorgeous
borne
on
men
s
shoulders
and
sheltered
by
a
royal
canopy
of
green
and
crimson
feathers
stood
a
figure
which
might
have
been
some
maiden
princess
arrayed
for
the
festival
or
as
she
seemed
to
one
or
two
of
the
more
superstitious
castilians
some
fiendish
goddess
conjured
up
by
the
diabolical
arts
of
the
priests
to
add
the
inspiration
of
her
presence
to
the
wild
fury
of
her
adorers
she
stood
erect
her
body
concealed
in
long
flowing
vestments
of
white
on
which
were
embroidered
serpents
of
some
green
material
in
her
hand
she
held
a
rod
imitative
of
the
same
reptile
and
on
her
forehead
was
a
coronet
of
feathers
surrounding
what
seemed
a
knot
of
little
snakes
writhing
round
a
star
or
sun
of
burnished
gold
as
this
fair
apparition
was
carried
through
their
ranks
between
the
great
wall
and
the
house
of
skulls
the
mexicans
were
seen
to
throw
themselves
reverently
on
the
earth
as
if
to
a
divinity
and
those
that
stood
most
remote
no
sooner
beheld
her
than
they
bowed
their
heads
with
the
deepest
humility
of
death
prevailed
throughout
the
chapel
respiration
and
reflection
itself
seemed
suspended
upon
the
awful
announcement
of
the
recluse
while
he
fell
back
upon
one
of
the
seats
of
the
aisle
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
in
unutterable
anguish
mrs
fairfax
had
been
visibly
agitated
from
the
first
moment
of
this
startling
interruption
by
some
more
dreadful
emotion
than
the
surprise
and
vague
alarm
of
those
about
her
but
now
desperation
itself
nerved
her
sinking
powers
as
she
stepped
a
pace
forward
and
uttered
in
a
distinct
voice
it
is
false
proceed
with
the
ceremony
harrison
and
dudley
instinctively
felt
for
their
arms
the
former
exclaiming
he
is
mad
staring
mad
be
it
our
business
to
prevent
this
irreverent
interruption
but
the
recluse
immediately
sprung
upon
his
feet
throwing
his
mask
upon
the
floor
as
he
stood
full
in
front
of
mrs
fairfax
and
exclaimed
pointing
with
his
index
finger
to
his
time
worn
countenance
look
thou
upon
these
long
forgotten
lineaments
and
then
upon
these
laying
his
hand
upon
bacon
s
head
and
testify
before
heaven
and
earth
whether
i
have
not
spoken
truth
a
fearful
truth
the
person
appealed
to
stood
for
some
moments
like
a
statue
her
eyes
protruding
from
their
sockets
as
if
a
tenant
of
the
grave
indeed
stood
before
her
her
hand
at
length
slowly
rose
from
her
side
and
wandered
through
the
vacant
air
as
if
she
would
have
submitted
the
spectre
to
the
test
of
feeling
imperfectly
measuring
the
distance
however
between
her
own
person
and
the
object
sought
it
fell
again
powerless
by
her
side
her
lips
moved
as
if
she
were
in
the
act
of
holding
a
conversation
with
the
being
who
had
addressed
her
but
no
sound
issued
from
them
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
were
painfully
distended
and
their
whole
expression
wild
and
bewildered
at
length
her
chest
began
to
heave
convulsively
when
she
made
a
wild
and
desperate
effort
to
rush
upon
the
object
of
her
gaze
but
fell
prostrate
on
the
floor
before
she
had
attained
half
the
distance
between
them
as
she
fell
she
cried
in
the
most
piteous
accents
charles
charles
and
then
swooned
away
charles
dudley
who
had
till
now
assisted
bacon
in
supporting
his
fainting
bride
resigned
his
charge
to
mr
harrison
and
ran
to
mrs
fairfax
supposing
himself
to
be
the
person
thus
piteously
apostrophized
he
took
the
fallen
lady
in
his
arms
and
raised
her
partly
from
the
floor
but
no
symptoms
of
returning
animation
were
visible
while
he
thus
supported
her
head
upon
one
knee
kneeling
upon
the
other
assisted
by
the
clergyman
and
friends
and
bacon
and
mr
harrison
supporting
virginia
who
was
in
little
better
condition
a
tumultuous
crowd
rushed
in
at
the
door
headed
by
sir
william
berkley
himself
exclaiming
to
his
minions
tear
him
from
the
altar
tear
the
upstart
from
the
altar
but
as
he
ran
with
his
drawn
sword
towards
the
pulpit
something
in
the
attitude
and
expression
of
the
various
parties
at
once
arrested
his
hand
and
voice
there
is
a
power
of
expression
in
deep
and
irremediable
sorrow
which
cannot
be
looked
upon
without
emotion
boisterous
and
outrageous
as
sir
william
berkley
had
entered
the
chapel
his
fierce
nature
was
instantly
subdued
by
the
appearance
of
his
sister
in
law
and
her
daughter
the
crowd
which
followed
were
instinctively
awed
into
silence
by
the
same
powerful
and
speaking
appeals
when
the
announcement
of
the
lawful
cause
which
prevented
the
consummation
of
the
union
first
fell
upon
bacon
s
ear
his
head
sank
upon
his
breast
and
although
he
mechanically
clasped
virginia
round
the
waist
as
he
felt
her
clinging
to
him
and
sinking
at
his
side
he
stood
stupefied
with
horror
holding
up
his
lifeless
burden
entirely
enable
to
think
or
act
his
habitual
and
superstitious
reverence
for
every
thing
uttered
by
the
recluse
induced
him
to
receive
the
first
impression
of
his
words
unchallenged
even
in
his
own
mind
by
the
time
that
sir
william
berkley
and
his
party
arrived
the
recluse
had
disappeared
every
one
was
so
much
absorbed
by
the
instant
and
pressing
calls
for
assistance
and
sympathy
from
the
suffering
females
that
the
time
of
his
departure
was
entirely
unnoticed
the
governor
had
no
sooner
recovered
from
his
first
shock
and
surprise
than
he
made
his
way
to
one
of
the
young
harrisons
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
present
appearance
of
the
parties
so
different
from
what
he
had
been
taught
to
expect
although
he
did
not
believe
that
there
was
one
word
of
truth
in
the
cause
assigned
for
the
interruption
of
the
ceremony
he
was
well
enough
satisfied
that
the
parties
themselves
and
mrs
fairfax
should
believe
it
no
matter
to
him
what
horrors
they
suffered
he
considered
it
all
but
a
just
punishment
for
their
attempted
mesalliance
as
for
bacon
and
his
horror
stricken
feelings
sir
william
did
not
deign
to
bestow
a
thought
or
word
upon
them
after
the
first
hasty
exclamation
with
which
he
had
entered
the
door
by
his
orders
the
female
sufferers
were
placed
in
a
carriage
and
removed
to
his
own
house
bacon
resigned
his
charge
with
a
listless
apathy
bordering
on
stupefaction
and
to
a
superficial
observer
such
would
doubtless
have
been
the
impression
but
his
was
the
deadly
deceitful
calm
which
precedes
the
coming
storm
the
most
horrible
of
all
human
sufferings
is
that
where
no
tear
is
or
can
be
shed
where
no
enemy
presents
himself
for
vengeance
no
hope
for
the
future
all
having
been
perilled
and
lost
upon
a
single
throw
bacon
felt
himself
thus
situated
the
cherished
hopes
of
a
lifetime
were
blasted
in
an
instant
not
only
for
the
present
but
under
such
circumstances
as
to
cut
off
all
hope
for
the
future
the
object
of
his
passion
could
not
henceforth
be
enshrined
in
a
holy
secret
worship
of
the
soul
such
as
is
sometimes
kept
up
through
a
long
life
of
celibacy
for
the
lost
one
no
mortified
indeed
error
there
be
would
even
in
its
fallacy
approach
the
benign
spirit
of
that
redeemer
who
looked
with
pity
upon
the
woes
of
earth
and
who
said
even
unto
the
most
abandoned
go
and
sin
no
more

midnight
scene
in
a
court
of
justice
hark
hush
be
still
they
come
one
moment
and
tis
o
er
it
is
a
mournful
thing
to
turn
from
the
last
clinging
hope
and
defence
of
the
accused
to
the
cold
severe
exaggerating
attacks
of
the
prosecution
perhaps
there
never
was
a
case
upon
a
capital
offence
where
the
eloquence
and
ingenuity
of
the
defendant
s
counsel
did
not
strike
out
upon
the
misery
of
the
accused
some
bright
sparks
of
hope
the
mass
of
evidence
cannot
be
borne
in
mind
at
once
a
perception
of
the
truth
often
requires
a
series
of
deliberate
and
abstruse
arguments
which
the
audience
never
discover
or
fail
to
retain
amid
the
confusion
of
evidence
and
the
instinct
of
mercy
the
sight
of
a
criminal
too
when
punishment
seems
certain
softens
the
heart
to
pity
and
prepares
it
to
magnify
and
dwell
upon
the
grounds
of
hope
an
ingenious
orator
in
an
artful
survey
of
the
case
lingers
with
disproportionate
force
upon
the
favourable
circumstances
and
leaves
the
more
unexplainable
and
condemnatory
parts
in
the
shade
for
a
moment
the
sky
of
the
accused
brightens
the
roaring
of
the
tempest
is
lulled
his
half
wrecked
mind
rests
as
the
surrounding
sea
of
doubt
and
despair
closes
its
yawning
abysses
and
he
beholds
again
the
green
and
sunny
shore
where
safety
and
bliss
await
his
weary
steps
ah
delusive
calm
ah
treacherous
hope
an
awful
pause
succeeds
the
words
of
mercy
and
hope
dreadful
the
task
of
him
who
has
to
dissolve
this
vision
the
prosecution
commenced
their
duty
as
their
skilful
batteries
were
opened
against
the
victim
the
brightness
passed
from
his
features
one
after
another
his
hopes
melted
away
the
relentless
tempest
darkened
over
his
head
the
mad
wind
began
to
roar
and
thunder
in
the
air
his
broken
hulk
once
more
hung
on
the
uplifted
and
giant
wave
the
distant
shore
receded
from
his
despairing
eyes
and
he
felt
that
ruin
and
death
again
yawned
beneath
his
feet
two
experienced
unfeeling
and
sagacious
lawyers
exhausted
their
powers
in
demonstrating
the
guilt
of
the
accused
in
which
they
both
fully
and
conscientiously
believed
germain
wove
around
him
the
meshes
of
sophistry
and
rendered
it
once
more
a
glaring
certainty
and
the
district
attorney
closed
with
a
startling
eloquence
the
orator
allowed
the
prisoner
s
apparent
good
character
allowed
the
horrid
spectacle
of
a
youth
so
formed
to
adorn
society
cut
off
and
crushed
beneath
a
fate
so
terrible
but
these
considerations
he
said
severely
were
not
for
the
jury
box
let
them
deepen
the
interest
of
a
poem
or
embellish
the
pages
of
a
novel
but
a
tribunal
of
justice
had
a
sterner
task
than
the
indulgence
of
feeling
however
amiable
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
every
circumstance
proclaimed
the
ride
the
disappearance
the
blood
stained
handkerchief
the
hat
floating
abandoned
on
the
stream
the
body
as
far
as
the
testimony
of
credible
witnesses
go
identified
as
that
of
rosalie
romain
the
confusion
of
the
assassin
his
conduct
on
the
arrest
the
evidence
of
the
female
domestic
respecting
the
demeanour
of
the
unfortunate
victim
her
clandestinely
meeting
the
prisoner
at
that
suspicious
hour
of
the
morning
every
thing
as
far
as
human
proof
could
proclaimed
the
dreadful
act
and
the
deep
cunning
of
the
prisoner
what
proof
can
you
demand
of
murder
it
is
a
deed
which
the
perpetrator
commits
alone
he
comes
not
in
the
broad
streets
where
positive
evidence
can
be
produced
against
him
he
steals
with
stealthy
pace
in
darkness
and
solitude
he
disguises
his
intention
under
smiles
and
the
mask
of
virtue
he
plants
the
dagger
in
a
moment
unseen
by
all
by
all
but
his
avenging
god
murder
rarely
admits
evidence
stronger
than
that
produced
against
this
man
if
you
acquit
him
upon
the
principle
of
doubt
future
assassins
have
only
to
stab
in
solitude
and
they
will
stab
in
safety
we
shall
behold
shameless
seducers
and
murderers
walking
among
us
unwhipped
of
justice
leave
crime
unpunished
and
you
open
the
flood
gates
through
which
devastation
and
despair
rush
in
upon
the
retreats
of
domestic
life
the
pity
which
makes
you
tremble
at
inflicting
a
necessary
penalty
which
causes
you
to
yield
to
the
pleadings
of
compassion
and
to
melt
at
the
sight
of
guilt
bound
on
the
altar
to
forget
law
society
the
claims
of
the
innocent
and
the
just
indignation
and
agony
of
the
bereaved
rather
than
speak
the
word
and
strike
the
blow
to
which
you
have
pledged
your
oaths
and
which
great
justice
demands
is
a
weak
an
idle
a
pernicious
feeling
full
of
danger
and
deceit
unworthy
of
fathers
citizens
men
you
are
the
guardians
of
the
community
to
your
hands
she
has
committed
her
safety
and
with
such
a
feeling
in
your
bosoms
will
you
betray
your
trust
she
has
placed
you
as
sentinels
on
her
walls
and
at
her
gates
do
not
kneel
and
admit
the
foe
which
you
are
sent
to
overcome
had
the
gaunt
form
of
murder
stalked
in
unabashed
and
unintimidated
amid
the
gayety
of
your
own
festive
board
had
your
startled
eyes
suddenly
beheld
him
vanish
and
lo
the
brightest
seat
at
the
banquet
is
left
vacant
had
you
beheld
the
demon
who
had
thus
bereaved
and
made
you
desolate
for
ever
stride
unfearing
and
unabashed
through
the
mid
day
streets
triumphing
in
his
deed
and
perhaps
grown
bold
by
experience
meditating
to
repeat
it
because
forsooth
the
shrinking
sensibilities
of
a
too
sentimental
jury
could
not
harden
their
hearts
to
arrest
his
career
you
would
feel
as
you
ought
to
feel
on
this
solemn
occasion
the
hospitality
of
friendship
the
rights
of
society
the
laws
of
man
and
of
god
have
been
grossly
violated
by
calling
loudly
for
relief
while
those
on
his
left
were
unemployed
terrible
was
the
cursing
and
clamour
and
twenty
voices
at
once
ordered
ned
out
of
the
line
ned
stepped
out
and
along
came
the
man
on
horseback
and
ordered
him
in
again
captain
said
ned
i
am
so
thirsty
that
i
can
do
nothing
until
i
get
some
water
and
they
will
not
let
me
drink
in
the
line
well
said
the
captain
step
in
and
i
ll
see
that
you
get
a
drink
ned
stepped
in
again
and
receiving
the
first
bucket
began
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
very
slowly
when
some
one
hallooed
to
him
to
pass
on
the
bucket
and
he
brought
it
down
again
and
handed
it
on
why
didnt
you
drink
said
the
captain
why
dont
you
see
they
wont
let
me
said
ned
dont
mind
what
they
say
drink
and
then
go
on
with
your
work
ned
took
the
next
bucket
and
commenced
raising
it
as
before
when
some
one
again
ordered
him
to
pass
on
the
bucket
there
said
ned
turning
to
the
captain
with
the
bucket
half
raised
you
hear
that
why
blast
your
eyes
said
the
captain

the

general

the

out

bucket

ned
left
the
ranks
and
went
to
his
lodgings
and
the
rising
sun
found
us
on
our
way
homeward
hall
the
fight
in
the
younger
days
of
the
republic
there
lived
in
the
county
of
two
men
who
were
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
the
very
best
men
in
the
county
which
in
the
georgia
vocabulary
means
they
could
flog
any
other
two
men
in
the
county
each
through
many
a
hard
fought
battle
had
acquired
the
mastery
of
his
own
battalion
but
they
lived
on
opposite
sides
of
the
courthouse
and
in
different
battalions
consequently
they
were
but
seldom
thrown
together
when
they
met
however
they
were
always
very
friendly
indeed
at
their
first
interview
they
seemed
to
conceive
a
wonderful
attachment
to
each
other
which
rather
increased
than
diminished
as
they
became
better
acquainted
so
that
but
for
the
circumstance
which
i
am
about
to
mention
the
question
which
had
been
a
thousand
times
asked
which
is
the
best
man
billy
stallions
stallings
or
bob
durham
would
probably
never
have
been
answered
billy
ruled
the
upper
battalion
and
bob
the
lower
the
former
measured
six
feet
and
an
inch
in
his
stockings
and
without
a
single
pound
of
cumbrous
flesh
about
him
weighed
a
hundred
and
eighty
the
latter
was
an
inch
shorter
than
his
rival
and
ten
pounds
lighter
but
he
was
much
the
most
active
of
the
two
in
running
and
jumping
he
had
but
few
equals
in
the
county
and
in
wrestling
not
one
in
other
respects
they
were
nearly
equal
both
were
admirable
specimens
of
human
nature
in
its
finest
form
billy
s
victories
had
generally
been
achieved
by
the
tremendous
power
of
his
blows
one
of
which
had
often
proved
decisive
of
his
battles
bob
s
by
his
adroitness
in
bringing
his
adversary
to
the
ground
this
advantage
he
had
never
failed
to
gain
at
the
onset
and
when
gained
he
never
failed
to
improve
it
to
the
defeat
of
his
adversary
these
points
of
difference
have
involved
the
reader
in
a
doubt
as
to
the
probable
issue
of
a
contest
between
them
it
was
not
so
however
with
the
two
battalions
neither
had
the
least
difficulty
in
determining
the
point
by
the
most
natural
and
irresistible
deductions
priori
and
though
by
the
same
course
of
reasoning
they
arrived
at
directly
opposite
conclusions
neither
felt
its
confidence
in
the
least
shaken
by
this
circumstance
the
upper
battalion
swore
that
billy
only
wanted
one
lick
at
him
to
knock
his
heart
liver
and
lights
out
of
him
and
if
he
got
two
at
him
he
d
knock
him
into
a
cocked
hat
the
lower
battalion
retorted
that
he
wouldnt
have
time
to
double
his
fist
before
bob
would
put
his
head
where
his
feet
ought
to
be
and
that
by
the
time
he
hit
the
ground
the
meat
would
fly
off
his
face
so
quick
that
people
would
think
it
was
shook
off
by
the
fall
these
disputes
often
led
to
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
but
with
such
equality
of
success
on
both
sides
as
to
leave
the
main
question
just
where
they
found
it
they
usually
ended
however
in
the
common
way
with
a
bet
and
many
a
quart
of
old
jamaica
whiskey
had
not
then
supplanted
rum
were
staked
upon
the
issue
still
greatly
to
the
annoyance
of
the
curious
billy
and
bob
continued
to
be
good
friends
now
there
happened
to
reside
in
the
county
just
alluded
to
a
little
fellow
by
the
name
of
ransy
sniffle
a
sprout
of
richmond
who
in
his
earlier
days
had
fed
copiously
upon
red
clay
and
blackberries
this
diet
had
given
to
ransy
a
complexion
that
a
corpse
would
have
disdained
to
own
and
an
abdominal
rotundity
that
was
quite
unprepossessing
long
spells
of
the
fever
and
ague
too
in
ransy
s
youth
had
conspired
with
clay
and
blackberries
to
throw
him
quite
out
of
the
order
of
nature
his
shoulders
were
fleshless
and
elevated
his
head
large
and
flat
his
neck
slim
and
translucent
and
his
arms
hands
fingers
and
feet
were
lengthened
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
rest
of
his
frame
his
joints
were
large
and
his
limbs
small
and
as
for
flesh
he
could
not
with
propriety
be
said
to
jenner
was
a
man
which
in
your
day
was
a
very
different
circumstance
i
verily
believe
if
it
had
been
a
woman
who
brought
that
happy
event
about
although
the
whole
world
would
have
availed
itself
of
the
discovery
her
name
would
scarcely
be
known
at
this
day
hastings
laughed
at
his
friend
s
angry
defence
of
women
s
rights
but
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
the
truth
of
what
was
said
there
was
always
a
great
unwillingness
in
men
to
admit
the
claims
of
women
but
it
was
not
a
time
nor
was
this
the
place
to
discuss
so
important
a
subject
he
intended
however
to
resume
it
the
first
leisure
moment
he
turned
his
eye
to
the
river
and
saw
vessels
innumerable
coming
and
going
and
on
the
arrival
of
one
a
little
larger
than
that
which
he
first
saw
the
crowd
pressed
forward
to
get
on
board
as
soon
as
she
should
land
where
is
that
vessel
from
said
hastings
she
looks
more
weather
beaten
than
the
rest
she
has
been
at
sea
yes
that
is
one
of
our
indiamen
let
us
go
to
her
i
see
a
friend
of
mine
on
board
he
went
out
as
supercargo
they
went
on
board
of
the
indiaman
and
although
it
had
encountered
several
storms
and
had
met
with
several
accidents
yet
the
crew
was
all
well
and
the
cargo
safe
the
vessel
was
propelled
by
the
same
machinery
there
was
neither
masts
nor
sails
how
many
months
have
they
been
on
their
return
said
hastings
hush
said
his
friend
edgar
do
not
let
any
one
hear
you
why
this
passage
has
been
a
very
tedious
one
and
yet
it
has
only
occupied
four
weeks
in
general
twenty
days
are
sufficient
well
said
hastings
after
this
i
shall
not
be
surprised
at
any
thing
why
in
my
time
we
considered
it
as
a
very
agreeable
thing
if
we
made
a
voyage
to
england
in
that
time
have
you
many
india
ships
yes
the
trade
has
been
opened
to
the
very
walls
of
china
the
number
of
our
vessels
has
greatly
increased
but
you
will
be
astonished
to
hear
that
the
emperor
of
china
gets
his
porcelain
from
france
no
i
am
not
now
that
i
hear
foreigners
have
access
to
that
mysterious
city
for
i
never
considered
the
indian
china
as
at
all
equal
to
the
french
either
in
texture
or
workmanship
but
i
presume
i
have
wonders
to
learn
about
the
chinese
yes
much
more
than
you
imagine
it
is
not
more
than
a
century
since
the
change
in
their
system
has
been
effected
before
that
no
foreigner
was
allowed
to
enter
their
gates
but
dissensions
among
themselves
effected
what
neither
external
violence
nor
manoeuvring
could
do
the
consequence
of
this
intercourse
with
foreign
nations
is
that
the
feet
of
their
women
are
allowed
to
grow
and
they
dress
now
in
the
european
style
they
import
their
fashions
from
france
and
i
see
by
the
papers
that
the
emperor
s
second
son
intends
to
pay
this
country
a
visit
they
have
english
and
french
as
well
as
german
and
spanish
schools
and
a
great
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
lower
classes
of
the
chinese
has
taken
place
but
it
was
first
by
humanizing
the
women
that
these
great
changes
were
effected
their
form
of
government
is
fast
approaching
that
of
ours
but
they
held
out
long
and
obstinately
their
climate
is
very
much
against
them
observed
hastings
mental
culture
must
proceed
slowly
where
the
heat
is
so
constant
and
excessive
yes
but
my
dear
sir
you
must
recollect
that
they
have
ice
in
abundance
now
we
carry
on
a
great
trade
in
that
article
in
fact
some
of
our
richest
men
owe
their
wealth
to
the
exportation
of
this
luxury
alone
boston
set
the
example
she
first
sent
cargoes
of
ice
to
china
but
it
was
not
until
our
fast
sailing
vessels
were
invented
that
the
thing
could
be
accomplished
i
should
think
it
almost
impossible
to
transport
ice
to
such
a
distance
even
were
the
time
lessened
to
a
month
or
six
weeks
as
it
now
is
you
must
recollect
that
half
of
this
difficulty
of
transporting
ice
was
lessened
by
the
knowledge
that
was
obtained
even
in
your
day
of
saving
ice
according
to
the
recorder
who
sneered
at
the
times
for
remaining
so
long
ignorant
of
the
fact
ice
houses
could
be
built
above
ground
with
the
certainty
that
they
would
preserve
ice
it
was
the
expense
of
building
those
deep
ice
houses
which
prevented
the
poor
from
enjoying
this
luxury
nay
necessary
article
now
every
landlord
builds
a
stack
of
ice
in
the
yard
and
thatches
it
well
with
oat
straw
and
the
corporation
have
an
immense
number
of
these
stacks
of
ice
distributed
about
the
several
wards
i
have
awakened
in
delightful
times
my
friend
oh
that
my
family
could
have
been
with
me
when
i
was
buried
under
the
mountain
young
hastings
seeing
the
melancholy
which
was
creeping
over
the
unfortunate
man
hurried
him
away
from
the
wharf
and
hastened
to
chestnut
street
our
hero
looked
anxiously
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
but
all
was
altered
all
was
strange
arcades
now
took
precedence
of
the
ancient
inconvenient
shops
there
being
one
between
every
square
extending
from
chestnut
to
market
on
one
side
and
to
walnut
on
the
other
intersecting
the
smaller
streets
and
alleys
in
their
way
here
alone
were
goods
sold
no
where
else
was
there
a
shop
seen
and
what
made
it
delightful
was
that
a
fine
stream
of
water
ran
through
pipes
under
the
centre
of
the
pavement
bursting
up
every
twenty
feet
in
little
jets
cooling
the
air
and
contributing
to
health
and
cleanliness
the
arcades
for
the
grocers
were
as
well
arranged
as
those
for
different
merchandize
and
the
fountains
of
water
which
flowed
perpetually
in
and
under
their
shops
dispersed
all
impure
smells
and
all
decayed
substances
all
this
is
beautiful
said
hastings
but
i
could
have
wished
to
find
in
arms
against
the
generous
master
who
so
well
deserved
his
grateful
devotion
i
speak
of
that
unfortunate
youth
whose
fault
i
must
not
use
a
harsher
term
nearly
twelve
months
ago
dishonored
our
common
name
and
parentage
your
excellency
will
appreciate
the
struggle
in
my
bosom
between
a
sense
of
duty
and
the
foolish
but
inextinguishable
relentings
of
nature
i
have
determined
to
put
an
end
to
this
painful
strife
and
to
take
security
against
my
own
weakness
by
sending
him
on
immediately
to
you
without
awaiting
the
result
of
the
meditated
sortie
in
the
morning
he
therefore
travels
in
custody
of
the
bearer
of
this
letter
under
guard
of
a
sergeant
and
four
men
having
returned
to
the
camp
this
night
after
tattoo
i
am
unprepared
to
give
any
account
of
our
loss
or
that
of
the
enemy
i
have
nothing
authentic
but
the
lamented
death
of
col
mason
who
fell
fighting
bravely
i
beg
leave
to
express
an
humble
hope
that
your
excellency
will
be
pleased
to
attribute
the
partial
failure
of
my
enterprise
to
the
unfortunate
wound
which
put
me
hors
du
combat
at
a
moment
up
to
which
we
had
successfully
driven
the
enemy
before
us
for
nearly
half
a
mile
and
across
the
river
i
remain
sir
with
the
most
profound
respect
your
excellency
s
most
humble
and
faithful
servant
owen
trevor
col
th
inf
a
worthy
gentleman
said
the
president
folding
up
the
letter
a
most
worthy
gentleman
let
any
man
doubt
henceforth
if
he
can
that
the
only
way
to
judge
in
advance
of
what
a
man
will
do
is
to
ascertain
his
interest
see
how
readily
it
settled
this
nice
point
of
casuistry
this
delicate
question
of
conflicting
duties
trust
yes
i
will
trust
but
not
as
fools
do
i
will
trust
no
man
s
honor
but
every
man
s
interest
the
experience
of
my
whole
life
has
taught
the
lesson
and
every
day
confirms
it
here
comes
a
new
example
added
he
as
the
door
bell
sounded
and
was
echoed
by
the
single
stroke
in
the
room
the
door
opened
and
the
honorable
mr
baker
appeared
his
figure
had
lost
nothing
of
its
deferential
bend
his
step
nothing
of
its
creeping
cautious
tread
his
countenance
nothing
of
its
abject
servility
but
there
was
more
of
anxiety
and
less
of
hope
with
a
slight
appearance
of
peevish
dissatisfaction
you
are
very
good
my
dear
sir
said
the
president
you
are
always
almost
present
to
my
wish
government
would
be
an
easy
task
ere
all
officers
like
you
i
humbly
thank
your
excellency
replied
the
judge
were
not
your
approbation
precious
to
me
i
might
be
tempted
perhaps
to
look
more
than
i
ought
to
public
opinion
perhaps
i
do
so
as
it
is
for
though
my
duties
are
clearly
necessary
to
the
good
of
the
state
i
find
it
hard
to
bear
the
loud
reproaches
of
a
misjudging
multitude
that
reach
me
through
a
factious
press
let
it
not
reach
you
my
dear
sir
the
storm
does
but
rage
without
why
need
you
hear
it
when
it
touches
you
not
shut
your
ears
and
sleep
soundly
or
open
them
only
to
the
more
pleasant
tones
that
issue
from
loyal
lips
i
take
care
not
to
know
what
is
said
of
me
by
malcontent
scribblers
but
i
hardly
flatter
myself
that
i
should
preserve
my
equanimity
if
i
read
all
that
is
written
it
is
sometimes
impossible
not
to
hear
said
the
judge
and
there
are
words
which
convey
reproach
which
though
uttered
in
a
single
breath
reach
the
heart
i
can
never
i
fear
make
myself
proof
against
such
a
phrase
as
judicial
murder
but
you
must
find
consolation
in
your
own
enlighted
conscience
my
dear
sir
some
feeling
must
be
expected
when
the
edge
of
the
law
falls
on
victims
whose
offences
demand
punishment
and
yet
are
such
as
those
the
world
calls
honorable
and
upright
are
most
likely
to
commit
the
misfortune
is
replied
the
other
that
it
is
only
for
such
offence
and
on
such
victims
that
my
office
seems
to
be
made
to
act
and
when
the
curse
rises
up
against
me
loud
as
well
as
deep
and
uttered
and
echoed
on
every
side
i
pray
your
excellency
to
pardon
me
when
i
say
that
i
find
its
honors
and
emoluments
a
poor
compensation
it
will
be
some
relief
to
you
then
replied
the
president
that
you
are
like
to
have
a
subject
of
a
different
sort
to
act
upon
one
whose
crimes
offend
against
the
laws
of
god
as
well
as
man
and
who
is
not
more
obnoxious
to
state
policy
than
to
the
detestation
of
all
good
men
and
of
none
more
than
yourself
of
whom
is
your
excellency
pleased
to
speak
asked
mr
baker
of
no
other
than
that
young
fellow
trevor
whose
ill
luck
snatched
him
away
from
our
hands
when
perhaps
he
was
not
quite
ripe
for
punishment
but
he
has
since
made
himself
perfect
in
crime
by
becoming
the
leader
of
a
desperate
banditti
in
short
he
is
no
other
than
the
famous
captain
douglas
and
is
now
in
my
power
i
think
you
will
find
in
his
case
a
fair
set
off
against
some
of
the
mortifications
of
which
you
complain
and
think
no
more
of
denying
your
services
to
the
public
at
least
until
he
has
fulfilled
his
destiny
the
effect
of
this
communication
on
the
mind
of
the
honorable
gentleman
was
such
as
the
president
had
anticipated
to
every
being
of
the
name
of
trevor
he
bore
a
mortal
antipathy
in
the
case
of
douglas
this
was
rendered
more
intense
by
the
sympathy
of
a
father
with
a
favorite
son
an
envious
malignity
was
a
striking
feature
in
the
characters
both
of
father
and
son
and
this
had
been
provoked
to
the
utmost
by
that
unfortunate
young
man
both
were
sensible
that
the
younger
baker
had
been
in
bad
odor
with
the
but
the
things
asserted
are
not
inventions
of
imagination
no
person
could
thus
delineate
scenes
which
he
had
not
beheld
and
therefore
maria
monk
witnessed
them
consequently
she
was
a
member
of
that
family
community
for
the
circumstances
which
she
narrates
nowhere
else
occurred
at
all
events
it
seems
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
an
individual
can
more
certainly
tell
what
had
been
his
own
course
of
life
than
persons
who
by
their
own
admission
know
nothing
of
the
subject
and
especially
when
her
statements
are
confirmed
by
such
unexceptionable
witnesses
there
are
however
two
collateral
points
of
evidence
which
strongly
confirm
maria
monk
s
direct
statements
one
is
derived
from
the
very
character
of
the
acknowledgments
which
she
made
and
the
period
when
they
were
first
disclosed
a
death
bed
says
the
poet
is
a
detector
of
the
heart
now
it
is
certain
that
the
appalling
facts
which
she
states
were
not
primarily
made
in
a
season
of
hilarity
or
with
any
design
to
make
money
by
them
or
with
any
expectation
that
they
would
be
known
to
any
other
person
than
mr
hilliker
mr
tappan
and
a
few
others
at
bellevue
but
when
there
was
no
anticipation
that
her
life
would
be
prolonged
and
when
agonized
with
the
most
dreadful
retrospection
and
prospects
it
is
not
possible
to
believe
that
any
woman
would
confess
those
facts
which
are
divulged
by
maria
monk
unless
from
dread
of
death
and
the
judgment
to
come
or
from
the
effect
of
profound
christian
penitence
feminine
repugnance
would
be
invincible
thus
the
alarm
of
eternity
her
entrance
upon
which
appeared
to
be
so
immediate
was
the
only
cause
of
those
communications
which
incontestably
prove
that
nunneries
are
the
very
nurseries
of
the
most
nefarious
crimes
and
the
most
abandoned
transgressors
the
other
consideration
is
this
that
admitting
the
statements
to
be
true
maria
monk
could
not
be
unconscious
of
the
malignity
of
roman
priests
and
of
her
own
danger
and
if
her
statements
were
fictitious
she
was
doubly
involving
herself
in
irreparable
disgrace
and
ruin
in
either
case
as
long
as
she
was
in
new
york
she
was
personally
safe
and
as
her
disclosures
had
been
restricted
to
very
few
persons
she
might
have
withdrawn
from
the
public
institution
and
in
privacy
have
passed
away
her
life
alike
unknowing
and
unknown
lunacy
itself
could
only
have
instigated
a
woman
situated
as
she
was
to
visit
montreal
and
there
defy
the
power
and
malice
and
fury
of
the
roman
priests
and
their
myrmidons
by
accumulating
upon
them
charges
of
rape
infanticide
the
affliction
of
the
tortures
of
the
inquisition
and
murders
of
cold
blooded
ferocity
in
the
highest
degree
with
all
the
atrocious
concomitant
iniquities
which
those
prolific
sins
include
now
it
is
certain
that
she
was
not
deranged
and
she
was
not
forced
she
went
deliberately
and
of
her
own
accord
to
meet
the
popish
priests
upon
the
spot
where
their
crimes
are
perpetrated
and
the
stronghold
of
their
power
whether
that
measure
was
the
most
prudent
and
politic
for
herself
and
the
most
wise
and
efficient
for
the
acquisition
of
the
avowed
object
may
be
disputed
but
the
exemplary
openness
and
the
magnanimous
daring
of
that
act
cannot
be
controverted
the
narrative
pages
to
l
respecting
the
cholera
and
the
election
riots
at
montreal
both
which
scenes
happened
at
the
period
when
dr
robertson
says
maria
monk
was
at
william
henry
or
st
denis
or
st
ours
could
not
have
been
described
at
least
that
part
of
it
respecting
the
wax
candles
and
the
preparation
for
defence
except
by
a
resident
of
the
nunnery
it
is
a
public
notorious
fact
that
blessed
candles
were
made
and
sold
by
the
nuns
and
used
at
montreal
under
the
pretext
to
preserve
the
houses
from
the
cholera
and
to
drive
it
away
that
those
candles
were
directed
so
to
be
kept
burning
by
the
pretended
injunction
of
the
pope
and
that
large
quantities
of
the
nunnery
candles
were
dispersed
about
montreal
and
its
vicinity
which
were
fixed
at
a
high
price
and
whoever
suffered
by
the
cholera
the
nuns
and
their
masters
the
priests
could
truly
say
by
this
craft
we
have
our
wealth
acts
it
is
obvious
that
a
young
papist
woman
at
service
at
william
henry
could
know
no
more
of
those
matters
than
if
she
had
been
at
labrador
for
the
incidental
remark
with
which
that
part
of
the
narrative
commences
is
one
of
those
apparently
superfluous
intimations
which
it
is
evident
a
person
who
was
writing
a
fiction
would
not
introduce
and
yet
it
is
so
profoundly
characteristic
of
a
canadian
convent
that
its
very
simple
artlessness
at
once
obliterates
dr
robertson
s
affidavit
there
were
a
few
instances
and
only
a
few
in
which
we
knew
any
thing
that
was
happening
in
the
world
and
even
then
our
knowledge
did
not
extend
out
of
the
city
we
cannot
be
infallibly
certain
of
maria
monk
s
description
of
the
interior
of
the
nunnery
but
that
unpremeditated
remark
so
minutely
descriptive
of
the
predominating
ignorance
among
the
nuns
of
all
terrestrial
concerns
exterior
of
the
convent
is
satisfactory
proof
that
the
narrator
was
not
sketching
from
fancy
but
depicting
from
actual
life
from
those
testimonies
direct
and
unintentional
it
is
fully
evident
that
maria
monk
was
a
long
resident
and
is
profoundly
acquainted
with
the
doings
in
the
hotel
dieu
convent
at
montreal
ii
what
collateral
evidence
can
be
adduced
of
the
truth
of
the
awful
disclosures
by
maria
monk
one
corroborative
testimony
is
derived
from
the
silence
of
the
roman
priests
and
their
avowed
partisans
months
have
passed
away
since
the
first
statements
of
those
matters
were
made
and
also
the
defence
of
the
priests
with
the
affidavits
and
other
connected
circumstances
were
presented
to
the
public
in
the
protestant
vindicator
one
of
the
persons
in
montreal
who
was
in
favour
of
the
jesuits
mr
doucet
stated
that
the
priests
never
take
up
such
things
they
allow
their
character
to
defend
the
mind
of
the
spectator
some
glimmering
of
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
the
vision
before
his
eyes
a
degree
of
hope
however
feeble
that
he
is
the
victim
of
chicanery
and
that
the
apparition
is
not
actually
a
visitant
from
the
old
world
of
shadows
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
such
remnants
of
doubt
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
almost
every
such
visitation
and
that
the
appalling
horror
which
has
sometimes
been
brought
about
is
to
be
attributed
even
in
the
cases
most
in
point
and
where
most
suffering
has
been
experienced
more
to
a
kind
of
anticipative
horror
lest
the
apparition
might
possibly
be
real
than
to
an
unwavering
belief
in
its
reality
but
in
the
present
instance
it
will
be
seen
immediately
that
in
the
minds
of
the
mutineers
there
was
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
basis
upon
which
to
rest
a
doubt
that
the
apparition
of
rogers
was
indeed
a
revivification
of
his
disgusting
corpse
or
at
least
its
spiritual
image
the
isolated
situation
of
the
brig
with
its
entire
inaccessibility
on
account
of
the
gale
confined
the
apparently
possible
means
of
deception
within
such
narrow
and
definite
limits
that
they
must
have
thought
themselves
enabled
to
survey
them
all
at
a
glance
they
had
now
been
at
sea
twenty
four
days
without
holding
more
than
a
speaking
communication
with
any
vessel
whatever
the
whole
of
the
crew
too
at
least
all
whom
they
had
the
most
remote
reason
for
suspecting
to
be
on
board
were
assembled
in
the
cabin
with
the
exception
of
allen
the
watch
and
his
gigantic
stature
he
was
six
feet
six
inches
high
was
too
familiar
in
their
eyes
to
permit
the
notion
that
he
was
the
apparition
before
them
to
enter
their
minds
even
for
an
instant
add
to
these
considerations
the
awe
inspiring
nature
of
the
tempest
and
that
of
the
conversation
brought
about
by
peters
the
deep
impression
which
the
loathsomeness
of
the
actual
corpse
had
made
in
the
morning
upon
the
imaginations
of
the
men
the
excellence
of
the
imitation
in
my
person
and
the
uncertain
and
wavering
light
in
which
they
beheld
me
as
the
glare
of
the
cabin
lantern
swinging
violently
to
and
fro
fell
dubiously
and
fitfully
upon
my
figure
and
there
will
be
no
reason
to
wonder
that
the
deception
had
even
more
than
the
entire
effect
which
we
had
anticipated
the
mate
sprang
up
from
the
mattress
on
which
he
was
lying
and
without
uttering
a
syllable
fell
back
stone
dead
upon
the
cabin
floor
and
was
hurled
to
the
leeward
like
a
log
by
a
heavy
roll
of
the
brig
of
the
remaining
seven
there
were
but
three
who
had
at
first
any
degree
of
presence
of
mind
the
four
others
sat
for
some
time
rooted
apparently
to
the
floor
the
most
pitiable
objects
of
horror
and
utter
despair
my
eyes
ever
encountered
the
only
opposition
we
experienced
at
all
was
from
the
cook
john
hunt
and
richard
parker
but
they
made
but
a
feeble
and
irresolute
defence
the
two
former
were
shot
instantly
by
peters
and
i
felled
parker
with
a
blow
on
the
head
from
the
pump
handle
which
i
had
brought
with
me
in
the
meantime
augustus
seized
one
of
the
muskets
lying
on
the
floor
and
shot
another
mutineer
wilson
through
the
breast
there
were
now
but
three
remaining
but
by
this
time
they
had
become
aroused
from
their
lethargy
and
perhaps
began
to
see
that
a
deception
had
been
practised
upon
them
for
they
fought
with
great
resolution
and
fury
and
but
for
the
immense
muscular
strength
of
peters
might
have
ultimately
got
the
better
of
us
these
three
men
were
jones
greely
and
absolom
hicks
jones
had
thrown
augustus
to
the
floor
stabbed
him
in
several
places
along
the
right
arm
and
would
no
doubt
have
soon
dispatched
him
as
neither
peters
nor
myself
could
immediately
get
rid
of
our
own
antagonists
had
it
not
been
for
the
timely
aid
of
a
friend
upon
whose
assistance
we
surely
had
never
depended
this
friend
was
no
other
than
tiger
with
a
low
growl
he
bounded
into
the
cabin
at
a
most
critical
moment
for
augustus
and
throwing
himself
upon
jones
pinned
him
to
the
floor
in
an
instant
my
friend
however
was
now
too
much
injured
to
render
us
any
aid
whatever
and
i
was
so
encumbered
with
my
disguise
that
i
could
do
but
little
the
dog
would
not
leave
his
hold
upon
the
throat
of
jones
peters
nevertheless
was
far
more
than
a
match
for
the
two
men
who
remained
and
would
no
doubt
have
dispatched
them
sooner
had
it
not
been
for
the
narrow
space
in
which
he
had
to
act
and
the
tremendous
lurches
of
the
vessel
presently
he
was
enabled
to
get
hold
of
a
heavy
stool
several
of
which
lay
about
the
floor
with
this
he
beat
out
the
brains
of
greely
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
discharging
a
musket
at
me
and
immediately
afterward
a
roll
of
the
brig
throwing
him
in
contact
with
hicks
he
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
by
dint
of
sheer
strength
strangled
him
instantaneously
thus
in
far
less
time
than
i
have
taken
to
tell
it
we
found
ourselves
masters
of
the
brig
the
only
person
of
our
opponents
who
was
left
alive
was
richard
parker
this
man
it
will
be
remembered
i
had
knocked
down
with
a
blow
from
the
pump
handle
at
the
commencement
of
the
attack
he
now
lay
motionless
by
the
door
of
the
shattered
stateroom
but
upon
peters
touching
him
with
his
foot
he
spoke
and
entreated
for
mercy
his
head
was
only
slightly
cut
and
otherwise
he
had
received
no
injury
having
been
merely
stunned
by
the
blow
he
now
got
up
and
for
the
present
we
secured
his
hands
behind
his
back
the
dog
was
still
growling
over
jones
but
upon
examination
we
found
him
completely
dead
the
none
of
those
associations
that
usually
lend
a
fascination
to
the
mysteries
of
the
craft
no
cave
with
wild
and
repulsive
entrance
concealed
her
no
lofty
trees
whispered
and
sighed
as
she
delivered
her
oracles
not
a
wrinkle
was
stamped
on
her
brow
there
was
even
something
of
beauty
in
her
regular
profile
and
her
large
black
eyes
threw
forth
a
lustrous
ray
still
as
we
entered
her
small
apartment
where
one
candle
glanced
with
dim
and
yellow
light
on
the
individual
who
pretended
to
the
awful
power
of
knowing
those
secrets
which
belong
only
to
the
eternal
our
laugh
was
checked
and
anna
s
fair
cheek
was
paler
than
its
usual
delicate
hue
she
trembled
so
much
that
i
half
regretted
her
presence
i
advanced
first
the
woman
looked
at
me
with
her
penetrating
eyes
and
pouring
some
tea
into
a
cup
waved
it
gently
until
the
grounds
were
scattered
and
settled
then
pouring
off
the
liquid
she
examined
them
with
an
air
of
deceptive
earnestness
i
believe
my
whole
heart
was
in
my
face
as
i
bent
eagerly
forward
to
this
singular
dispenser
of
destiny
what
a
war
of
feeling
and
reason
here
said
she
peering
at
the
cup
is
a
young
man
on
horseback
and
there
do
you
see
something
shining
there
and
she
pointed
with
a
bodkin
to
the
centre
of
the
cup
looking
full
in
my
eyes
see
there
is
a
ring
and
i
was
silly
enough
to
forget
that
a
young
man
and
a
ring
would
probably
be
the
very
first
things
that
a
fortuneteller
would
speak
of
to
a
girl
of
my
age
and
putting
my
hands
to
my
ears
i
screamed
out
no
no
not
another
word
i
will
not
hear
another
word
while
lewis
clapped
his
hands
and
shouted
excellent
go
on
good
woman
go
on
but
i
was
resolute
i
felt
as
if
the
walls
had
ears
and
eyes
and
that
too
much
had
already
been
told
and
sheltered
my
burning
face
behind
anna
now
miss
anna
said
lewis
as
with
gentle
force
he
drew
her
towards
the
woman
how
beautiful
she
was
at
that
moment
in
the
struggle
to
conquer
her
reluctance
perhaps
the
contrast
of
the
tall
commonplace
figure
of
the
fortune
teller
made
her
spiritual
loveliness
more
striking
she
grasped
her
little
fan
almost
convulsively
her
eyes
shunned
the
dark
orbs
that
were
fixed
upon
her
and
as
the
lips
of
the
fortuneteller
uttered
a
sound
she
caught
lewis
s
hand
and
looked
up
to
him
beseechingly
while
tears
started
to
her
eyes
lewis
could
trifle
no
longer
he
retained
her
hand
throwing
at
the
same
time
a
double
douceur
to
the
woman
and
said
earnestly
god
forbid
that
my
boyish
whims
should
give
you
a
moment
s
pang
and
drawing
her
arm
in
his
he
whispered
as
we
descended
the
steps
let
me
read
your
fortune
sweet
trembler
and
its
first
and
last
oracle
shall
be
love
love
it
was
the
only
time
he
had
spoken
thus
anna
was
silent
through
our
ride
once
she
sighed
so
deeply
that
we
started
and
i
felt
a
warm
tear
drop
on
my
arm
we
reached
the
hall
and
were
separated
a
while
by
the
dance
the
next
time
i
saw
her
her
cheek
was
glowing
her
eye
sparkling
her
step
light
as
a
fay
s
on
a
moonbeam
and
her
smile
all
radiance
and
joy
while
lewis
stood
not
dancing
with
her
but
gazing
on
her
and
she
knew
that
it
was
so

guests
a
morning
walk
new
trials
show
not
to
the
poor
thy
pride
let
their
home
a
cottage
be
nor
the
country
dweller
hide
in
a
palace
fit
for
thee
better
far
his
humble
shed
humble
sheds
of
neighbours
by
and
the
old
and
scanty
bed
where
he
sleeps
and
hopes
to
die
crabbe
i
wish
your
likeness
had
been
taken
last
night
said
i
to
anna
as
walking
through
king
street
on
the
morning
after
the
ball
i
glanced
at
her
placid
face
you
will
never
look
again
as
you
did
then
with
that
shakspeare
expression
between
tragedy
and
comedy
how
could
you
fit
those
gloves
at
madame
s
store
so
quietly
with
lewis
at
your
side
if
my
heart
s
wishes
were
in
such
a
train
as
yours
i
should
have
jumped
over
the
counter
anna
looked
at
me
with
an
arch
expression
which
seemed
to
say
if
you
could
see
down
far
into
my
heart
you
would
not
find
any
trying
on
of
gloves
there
gentle
creature
why
was
she
not
spared
for
a
riper
friendship
how
rich
how
golden
would
have
been
her
maturity
but
heaven
calls
such
spirits
to
minister
at
its
eternal
altar
while
we
of
coarser
mould
are
left
to
struggle
with
the
world
when
we
returned
from
our
walk
the
servants
told
us
that
a
cracker
man
and
woman
were
in
the
drawing
room
waiting
for
papa
on
reaching
the
door
which
was
partly
open
i
perceived
a
tall
sallow
looking
countryman
wagoners
so
called
from
the
snapping
of
their
long
whips
to
stimulate
their
team
with
a
blue
homespun
dress
which
hung
loosely
about
him
standing
with
his
hat
on
his
arms
akimbo
speaking
to
a
young
girl
almost
equally
sallow
also
dressed
in
homespun
with
a
cracker
or
cape
bonnet
of
the
same
material
as
he
addressed
her
she
rose
and
they
stood
before
one
of
the
small
convex
mirrors
at
that
time
in
fashion
now
susy
said
he
just
see
what
a
smart
chance
smaller
it
makes
us
so
speaking
they
walked
backwards
gazing
at
their
diminishing
size
exclaiming
if
that
ant
despert
curous
well
anyhow
that
s
droll
until
they
nearly
fell
over
anna
and
me
as
we
entered
recovering
themselves
they
nodded
at
us
the
man
keeping
his
hat
on
still
i
should
have
been
embarrassed
had
not
papa
entered
and
instantly
recognising
his
visiter
cordially
shook
hands
with
him
and
who
is
this
said
he
turning
to
the
young
gentlemen
as
busily
employed
as
bees
in
a
hive
a
very
little
man
approached
us
from
the
further
end
of
the
store
jerking
his
little
arms
and
legs
with
the
precision
and
ease
of
an
automaton
his
dress
was
new
and
bright
and
neat
mr
lummucks
introduced
me
to
him
he
was
no
other
than
mr
smith
davis
himself
the
principal
of
the
firm
i
was
almost
struck
dumb
to
see
so
much
importance
confined
within
so
small
a
compass
he
shook
me
cordially
by
the
hand
and
asked
mr
lummucks
if
he
knew
me
know
him
like
a
book
replied
mr
lummucks
mr
smith
davis
shook
me
by
the
hand
again
and
said
he
was
very
happy
to
see
me
he
asked
me
how
the
times
were
and
offered
me
a
cigar
which
i
took
for
fear
of
giving
offence
but
the
first
opportunity
i
got
i
threw
it
away
buy
for
cash
or
time
he
asked
i
was
a
little
startled
at
the
abruptness
of
the
question
but
i
replied
for
cash
would
you
like
to
look
at
some
prints
major
he
asked
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
replied
i
am
very
fond
of
seeing
prints
with
that
mr
smith
davis
commenced
turning
over
one
piece
of
calico
after
another
with
amazing
rapidity
there
major
very
desirable
article
splendid
style
only
two
and
six
we
done
a
first
rate
business
in
that
article
last
season
cheapest
goods
in
the
street
before
i
could
make
any
reply
or
even
guess
at
the
meaning
of
mr
davis
s
remarks
he
was
called
away
and
mr
lummucks
stepped
up
and
supplied
his
place
you
had
better
buy
em
colonel
said
mr
lummucks
they
will
sell
like
hot
cakes
but
did
you
say
you
bought
for
cash
of
course
i
said
if
i
buy
at
all
he
took
a
memorandum
book
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
in
it
for
a
moment
let
me
see
he
said
franco
franco
franco
what
did
you
say
your
firm
was
something
and
franco
or
franco
and
somebody
i
have
no
firm

replied

have
got
your
first
name

in
my
tickler

mr
lummucks
making
a
memorandum
and
your
references
colonel
who
did
you
say
were
your
references
i
have
no
references
i
replied
indeed
i
know
of
no
one
to
whom
i
could
refer
unless
to
my
father
what
the
old
boy
in
the
country
my
father
is
in
the
country
i
answered
seriously
not
very
well
pleased
to
hear
my
parent
called
the
old
boy
then
you
have
no
city
references
hey
none
at
all
sir
i
have
no
friends
here
except
yourself
me
exclaimed
mr
lummucks
apparently
in
great
amazement
oh
ah
but
how
much
of
a
bill
do
you
mean
to
make
with
us
colonel
perhaps
i
may
buy
a
vest
pattern
i
replied
if
you
have
got
some
genteel
patterns
a
vest
pattern
cried
mr
lummucks
what
hav
nt
you
come
down
for
the
purpose
of
buying
goods
no
sir
i
replied
i
came
to
new
york
to
seek
for
employment
and
as
you
had
shown
me
so
many
kind
attentions
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
assist
me
in
finding
a
situation
mr
lummucks
countenance
underwent
a
very
singular
change
when
i
announced
my
reasons
for
calling
on
him
do
you
see
any
thing
that
looks
green
in
there
he
said
pulling
down
his
eyelid
with
his
forefinger
no
sir
i
do
not
i
replied
looking
very
earnestly
into
his
eye
nor
in
there
either
he
said
pulling
open
his
other
eye
nothing
at
all
sir
i
replied
i
guess
not
said
mr
lummucks
and
without
making
me
any
other
answer
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
me
reg
larly
sucked
jack
asked
a
young
man
who
had
been
listening
to
our
conversation
do
nt
mention
it
said
mr
lummucks
no
you
do
nt
said
the
other
mr
lummucks
walked
up
to
mr
smith
davis
and
whispered
in
his
ear
a
few
words
upon
which
that
little
gentleman
turned
round
and
frowned
upon
me
most
awfully
i
was
about
to
demand
an
explanation
of
this
strange
conduct
when
mr
smith
davis
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
he
was
not
a
retailer
but
a
jobber
and
advised
me
if
i
wanted
to
negotiate
for
a
vest
pattern
to
go
into
chatham
street
my
first
impulse
was
to
take
mr
smith
davis
up
in
my
arms
and
give
him
a
good
smart
cuff
on
his
ears
but
i
restrained
my
indignation
and
merely
remarked
to
him
that
if
he
was
not
a
retailer
he
was
in
a
remarkably
small
way
leave
my
store
sir
said
mr
smith
davis
turning
very
pale
do
nt
be
frightened
i
said
i
would
not
stay
in
it
upon
any
account
and
without
more
ado
i
did
leave
it
but
with
feelings
very
different
from
those
with
which
i
had
entered
it
to
meet
with
such
a
rebuff
upon
my
first
application
for
assistance
was
a
cruel
disappointment
to
me
and
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
tears
i
thought
of
my
poor
mother
and
sister
and
above
all
of
my
cousin
s
prophecy
and
my
heart
sunk
within
me
it
was
not
until
i
had
gone
to
my
chamber
and
given
vent
to
my
feelings
in
a
flood
of
tears
that
i
could
regain
my
self
possession
and
revolve
in
my
mind
some
other
plan
of
operations
i
sat
opposite
to
mr
lummucks
again
at
dinner
but
he
did
not
even
give
me
a
look
of
recognition
i
thought
it
was
well
perhaps
that
i
had
met
at
the
very
outset
of
life
with
such
an
instance
of
hollow
heartedness
and
deceit
as
it
would
learn
me
forever
after
to
be
on
my
guard
in
my
intercourse
we
rode
here
that
if
she
were
of
my
sex
i
should
say
most
decidedly
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
you
did
she
v
replied
miss
grattan
tremulously
and
with
a
blush
that
might
have
been
detected
by
the
moonbeam
indeed
i
know
no
one
whose
good
opinion
i
would
rather
have
but
rejoined
she
with
confusion
you
are
jesting
with
me
jesting
with
you
you
do
me
great
injustice
i
suppose
you
have
plenty
of
tjgie
to
grow
romantic
here
and
really
notwithstanding
miss
fitzhurst
s
allegations
against
me
i
should
be
surprised
if
you
did
not
what
a
beautiful
sweep
those
hills
have
and
look
at
the
graceful
windings
of
that
silvery
stream
stealing
away
like
a
great
and
happy
life
to
be
lost
in
the
great
ocean
yes
you
might
fall
in
love
here
have
some
one
who
should
be
the
ocean
to
the
river
of
your
thoughts
ah
exclaimed
fanny
fitzhufst
who
had
overheard
the
latter
part
of
this
remark
remember
mr
pinckney
that
you
are
quoting
from
a
dream
a
most
powerful
poet
s
dream
yes
miss
fitzhurst
you
have
me
fairly
for
that
dream
tells
of
two
beings
the
life
of
one
of
whom
ended
in
madness
and
both
in
misery
remember
that
dream
was
shaped
out
like
a
reality
and
from
a
reality
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
here
the
party
had
approached
so
near
the
huskers
as
to
be
seen
distinctly
by
them
this
was
apparent
from
the
increased
and
ambitious
alacrity
with
which
they
worked
and
the
evident
effect
which
they
tried
to
throw
into
their
song
when
nat
the
singer
saw
them
coming
he
did
not
join
the
chorus
of
the
last
verse
but
paused
longer
than
usual
before
he
commenced
again
he
was
taxing
his
powers
to
produce
something
extemporaneous
in
honor
of
the
ladies
his
gifts
as
an
improvisatore
were
proven
by
the
following
verse
which
he
gave
forth
in
his
best
manner
the
coon
likes
corn
and
we
like
he
wid
the
possum
fat
and
the
nominee
o
the
ladies
come
do
nt
you
see

their
lobely
eyes
shine
like
a
star

virginny
never
tire
there
s
poetry
and
romance
for
you
miss
fanny
pitzhurst
said
pinckney
with
a
hearty
laugh
in
intention
at
least
mr
howard
pinckney
rejoined
fanny
and
that
when
it
is
good
makes
the
humblest
offering
praiseworthy
true
true
and
truth
in
this
instance
is
poetry
s
handmaid
wo
have
the
authority
of
the
poets
of
all
time
for
comparing
the
ladies
eyes
to
stars
they
are
not
only
brilliant
like
the
stars
but
like
them
they
control
our
destiny
at
the
foot
of
an
oak
near
the
west
end
of
the
corn
heap
not
at
all
satisfied
so
far
with
the
events
of
the
evening
sat
pompey
he
had
mingled
with
the
huskers
but
for
a
short
time
after
nat
commenced
his
song
when
complaining
that
he
could
not
keep
time
with
such
a
grunter
as
the
singer
he
withdrew
from
among
them
he
sat
wrapped
in
an
old
coat
with
his
back
against
the
tree
to
keep
the
cold
off
and
with
his
feet
and
part
of
his
person
entirely
covered
with
corn
husks
his
wool
was
amplified
into
the
dimensions
of
an
ancient
wig
and
his
hat
was
cocked
a
little
on
one
side
on
the
top
of
it
as
much
from
an
air
of
self
importance
as
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
the
conversation
of
his
companion
bobby
had
his
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
pantaloons
which
were
made
of
the
stuff
called
corduroy
and
considerably
worn
the
collar
of
his
jacket
was
turned
up
and
the
brim
of
his
hat
turned
down
so
as
to
meet
it
and
keep
him
as
he
said
as
snug
as
a
possum
in
a
gum
tree
it
was
not
at
all
cool
to
any
one
who
was
exercising
the
least
but
after
walking
and
husking
a
short
time
the
worthies
paused
from
their
labours
and
sat
down
when
feeling
slightly
chilled
they
had
resorted
to
the
mode
of
keeping
themselves
comfortable
which
we
have
described
at
bobby
s
feet
by
way
of
a
footstove
towzer
his
dog
was
crouching
every
now
and
then
when
the
huskers
sang
remarkably
loud
towzer
would
lift
his
head
lazily
from
his
master
s
feet
glance
carelessly
around
and
nestle
in
the
corn
husks
again
occasionally
bobby
would
pat
him
on
the
head
when
he
would
wag
his
tail
and
gather
himself
up
closer
to
his
master
s
person
ah
exclaimed
bobby
look
out
in
the
moonlight
pompey
there
s
miss
fanny
i
forgot
cousin
peggy
told
me
to
ask
miss
fanny
if
she
would
want
her
at
the
big
house
to
morrow
there
s
time
enough
said
pompey
f
master
bobby
aint
that
colonel
bentley
there
yes
said
bobby
i
believe
it
is
at
this
point
nat
ramsay
rolled
forth
his
compliment
to
the
ladies
pompey
jerked
his
hat
over
his
eyes
as
he
heard
it
and
exclaimed
mister
bobby
now
just
listen
to
that
nigger
he
s
in
liquor
now
he
s
in
liquor
nebriated
an
he
thinks
he
s
taking
the
shine
off
of
everything
to
give
you
a
hidear
mister
bobby
of
what
a
fool
nigger
that
nat
is
i
ll
tell
you
you
diskiver
and
observe
that
one
day
i
driv
my
young
mistress
miss
fanny
over
to
miss
bentleys
and
i
was
a
setting
on
my
coach
box
a
thinking
a
great
many
things
i
can
think
my
hardest
on
a
coach
box
in
the
midst
of
it
here
comes
nat
ramsey
black
as
the
driven
charcoal
toting
his
big
foot
right
by
miss
bentley
s
door
between
me
and
the
coach
and
the
house
but
i
tell
you
pompey
observed
bobby
nat
ca
nt
help
it
if
he
has
such
a
leg
it
aint
his
fault
he
saying
no
rosalia
again
pardon
me
i
have
but
one
word
more
and
will
no
longer
distress
you
think
no
more
of
this
rash
avowal
there
is
nothing
due
to
it
t
was
involuntary
and
one
believe
me
which
i
could
not
have
made
in
a
moment
of
reflection
for
without
hope
no
i
should
never
then
have
had
the
presumption
to
hope
forgive
it
then
and
if
you
can
forget
that
i
have
dared
to
make
so
ill
a
return
for
the
notice
with
which
you
have
but
too
much
honored
me
rosalia
attempted
to
speak
but
her
lips
moved
without
sound
i
ask
no
answer
continued
monaldi
mournfully
i
deserve
none
but
rather
and
let
that
be
my
atonement
that
i
leave
you
and
forever
no
no
said
rosalia
in
a
voice
hardly
audible
a
moment
of
breathless
silence
followed
while
she
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
as
if
it
could
impart
the
strength
which
she
needed
to
proceed
but
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
restored
her
to
herself
monaldi
your
frankness
can
you
forgive
it
i
will
do
more
monaldi
i
will
return
it
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
but
her
strength
failed
her
and
he
caught
her
on
his
bosom
chapter
ix
within
a
short
lover
s
age
monaldi
became
a
husband
and
his
happiness
would
now
have
been
complete
could
he
have
felt
assured
that
peace
was
again
restored
to
his
friend
but
maldura
had
long
since
disappeared
having
left
his
lodgings
the
day
after
monaldi
s
offer
nor
could
the
least
trace
of
him
be
discovered
monaldi
felt
the
disappointment
the
more
as
he
had
now
persuaded
himself
that
no
melancholy
however
wayward
could
long
withstand
the
sympathy
of
his
wife
maldura
s
absence
was
occasioned
by
a
letter
from
sienna
announcing
the
death
of
a
rich
relation
and
calling
him
there
to
take
possession
of
his
inheritance
a
few
years
back
this
accession
of
wealth
would
have
filled
him
with
joy
but
what
is
wealth
to
the
crumbled
hopes
of
intellectual
ambition
it
cannot
rebuild
them
maldura
received
the
intelligence
without
the
moving
a
muscle
though
it
gave
no
pain
it
could
give
no
pleasure
for
he
was
no
sensualist
he
had
never
had
but
one
vice
the
lust
of
praise
which
seated
in
his
brain
seemed
like
a
voracious
reptile
to
swallow
up
every
thought
as
soon
as
born
till
bloated
with
overgorging
it
had
left
no
room
for
the
growth
of
another
to
a
vice
like
this
money
was
useless
except
with
a
coxcomb
but
maldura
was
no
coxcomb
and
he
disdained
to
beg
or
bribe
even
for
praise
yet
he
notwithstanding
took
possession
of
his
fortune
there
was
no
one
on
earth
whom
he
loved
and
there
was
some
satisfaction
he
thought
in
possessing
that
which
many
wanted
he
was
content
to
be
rich
because
others
were
poor
having
arranged
his
affairs
he
now
began
to
consider
whither
to
direct
his
course
he
had
quitted
rome
as
he
believed
forever
and
florence
was
associated
with
too
many
bitter
recollections
to
be
thought
of
again
but
where
to
go
he
knew
not
for
having
no
longer
any
object
there
was
nothing
to
draw
him
to
one
place
more
than
another
in
this
state
of
indecision
having
one
evening
strolled
into
a
coffee
house
a
stranger
near
him
mentioned
the
name
of
monaldi
he
thought
he
had
schooled
himself
to
hear
it
with
indifference
yet
he
leaned
over
his
table
towards
the
speaker
the
stranger
was
giving
an
account
to
a
person
next
him
of
monaldi
s
marriage
maldura
listened
with
little
change
of
feeling
till
he
heard
the
name
of
rosalia
landi
he
could
hear
no
more
but
starting
up
rushed
out
of
the
house
i
go
to
rome
said
maldura
to
his
servant
as
soon
as
he
reached
home
to
night
sir
exclaimed
the
man
staring
yes
to
night
business
calls
me
why
t
is
almost
dark
sir
i
want
not
your
attendance
said
maldura
impatiently
i
go
alone
now
see
to
my
portmanteau
and
order
a
horse
to
the
door
the
servant
obeyed
and
maldura
was
soon
on
his
way
it
was
enough
he
thought
to
have
been
rejected
but
to
be
rejected
for
one
whom
of
all
others
he
most
envied
and
therefore
most
hated
to
know
that
the
woman
he
had
once
loved
and
the
man
he
had
once
almost
despised
were
now
as
one
that
they
were
prosperous
and
happy
that
without
title
rank
almost
without
family
they
were
yet
objects
of
the
public
gaze
of
public
admiration
and
that
go
where
he
would
talk
with
whom
he
would
he
must
hear
forever
of
the
painter
monaldi
and
his
beautiful
wife
to
know
all
this
whilst
himself
was
unknown
miserable
drove
him
to
madness
he
uttered
no
curse
he
did
not
weaken
by
words
the
deadly
purpose
which
lay
at
his
heart
what
that
was
he
had
not
yet
defined
in
any
of
its
particulars
even
to
himself
yet
he
only
waited
to
mature
it
till
he
should
find
a
proper
instrument
to
give
it
action
till
then
he
was
contented
with
brooding
over
its
general
form
and
steadily
looking
forward
to
its
birth
in
this
mood
maldura
pursued
his
journey
he
had
now
reached
radicofani
and
was
slowly
moving
up
the
mountain
the
reins
given
to
his
horse
his
eyes
closed
and
his
thoughts
busy
about
the
future
when
a
voice
before
him
suddenly
commanded
him
to
stop
he
raised
his
eyes
but
it
being
after
nightfall
he
could
only
discern
the
figure
of
a
horseman
standing
in
his
path
and
presenting
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
pistol
maldura
was
wholly
unprepared
for
defence
for
he
had
quitted
sienna
in
too
much
haste
and
was
too
intent
on
the
object
of
his
journey
to
think
of
providing
himself
with
arms
besides
it
is
doubtful
whether
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
would
have
taken
the
precaution
had
it
of
the
night
when
he
found
from
a
close
private
examination
which
he
had
given
me
before
my
admission
that
my
knowledge
of
the
law
was
quite
as
good
as
the
greater
number
of
those
who
apply
for
admission
he
was
pleased
to
express
his
astonishment
at
my
perseverance
and
delight
at
my
success
when
too
in
addition
to
this
he
discovered
upon
a
minute
inquiry
from
my
employers
and
others
that
i
was
abstemious
and
indulged
in
no
excesses
of
any
kind
his
interest
in
me
increased
as
i
thought
who
had
been
accustomed
to
nothing
of
the
sort
beyond
all
reasonable
measure
and
i
soon
had
occasion
to
perceive
that
it
was
no
idle
curiosity
that
prompted
his
consideration
and
inquiry
without
my
knowledge
he
paid
a
visit
to
my
uncle
this
gentleman
i
may
be
permitted
here
to
say
had
been
quite
as
much
surprised
as
anybody
else
at
my
determined
prosecution
of
my
studies
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
by
which
i
was
surrounded
that
i
was
pursuing
them
while
in
the
mercantile
establishment
to
which
i
had
gone
he
did
not
believe
and
very
frequently
when
i
was
at
his
house
for
i
visited
the
family
and
sometimes
though
unfrequently
dined
with
them
on
a
sabbath
he
jeered
me
on
my
progress
the
wonderful
progress
as
he
was
pleased
to
term
it
which
he
felt
sure
i
was
making
with
my
coke
and
blackstone
while
baling
blankets
or
bundling
up
plains
and
kerseys
this
i
bore
patiently
sustained
as
i
was
by
the
proud
indomitable
spirit
within
me
which
assured
me
of
the
ultimate
triumph
which
i
felt
positive
would
ensue
i
enjoyed
his
surprise
a
surprise
that
looked
something
like
consternation
when
the
very
day
of
my
admission
to
the
bar
and
after
that
event
i
encountered
him
in
the
street
and
in
answer
to
his
usual
sarcastic
inquiry
well
edward
how
does
the
law
come
on
how
is
sir
william
blackstone
sir
edward
coke
and
the
rest
of
the
white
heads
i
simply
put
the
parchment
into
his
hands
which
declared
my
formal
introduction
to
those
venerable
gentry
why
you
do
nt
mean
is
it
possible
so
you
really
are
admitted
a
lawyer
eh
you
see
sir
and
that
too
without
any
greek
well
and
what
good
is
it
to
do
you
to
have
a
profession
edward
is
one
thing
to
get
business
another
yes
sir
but
i
take
it
the
profession
must
be
had
first
one
step
is
gained
that
much
is
sure
the
other
i
trust
will
follow
in
due
season
true
but
i
still
think
that
the
bricklayer
would
make
the
more
money
were
money
making
sir
the
only
object
of
life
perhaps
then
that
would
be
the
most
desirable
business
but
oh
i
forgot
the
talents
the
talents
are
to
be
considered
and
after
the
utterance
of
this
sneer
our
dialogue
as
may
be
supposed
did
not
much
longer
continue
i
did
not
know
of
the
contemplated
visit
of
mr
edgerton
to
my
worthy
uncle
nor
of
its
purpose
or
i
should
most
assuredly
have
put
my
veto
upon
the
measure
with
all
the
tenacity
of
a
resentful
spirit
but
this
gentleman
who
was
a
man
of
nice
sensibility
as
well
as
strong
good
sense
readily
comprehended
a
portion
of
my
secret
history
from
what
was
known
to
him
he
easily
conceived
that
my
uncle
was
somewhat
of
a
niggard
from
the
manner
in
which
i
had
employed
myself
during
my
preparation
for
the
bar
he
thought
however
that
my
uncle
though
unwilling
to
expend
money
in
the
prosecution
of
a
scheme
which
he
did
not
approve
now
that
the
scheme
was
so
far
successful
as
to
afford
every
promise
of
a
reasonable
harvest
could
not
do
less
than
come
forward
to
the
assistance
of
one
who
had
shown
such
a
determined
disposition
to
assist
himself
he
was
mistaken
he
little
knew
the
man
his
interview
with
my
uncle
was
a
short
one
the
parties
were
already
acquainted
though
not
intimately
they
knew
each
other
as
persons
of
standing
in
the
same
community
and
this
made
the
opening
of
mr
edgerton
s
business
easy
i
state
the
tenor
of
the
interview
as
it
came
to
my
knowledge
afterward
mr
clifford
he
said
you
have
a
nephew
a
young
gentleman
who
has
been
recently
admitted
to
the
bar
mr
edward
clifford
the
reply
with
a
look
of
wonder
was
necessarily
affirmative
i
have
had
much
pleasure
continued
the
other
in
knowing
him
for
some
time
he
is
an
intimate
of
my
eldest
son
and
from
what
has
met
my
eyes
sir
i
should
say
you
are
fortunate
in
having
a
nephew
of
so
much
promise
why
yes
sir
i
believe
he
is
a
clever
youth
enough
was
the
costive
answer
he
is
more
than
that
sir
i
regard
him
indeed
as
a
most
astonishing
young
man
the
very
manner
in
which
he
has
pursued
his
studies
while
engaged
in
the
harassing
labors
of
a
large
wholesale
business
house
of
this
city
alone
establishes
this
fact
the
cheeks
of
my
uncle
reddened
the
last
sentence
of
mr
edgerton
was
unfortunate
for
his
object
it
conveyed
a
tacit
reproof
which
the
niggardly
conscience
of
mr
clifford
readily
appropriated
and
perhaps
anticipated
he
dreaded
lest
mr
edgerton
knew
all
you
are
probably
aware
mr
edgcrton
he
replied
with
equal
hesitancy
and
haste
you
have
heard
that
edward
clifford
is
an
orphan
that
he
has
nothing
and
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
he
should
learn
to
employ
himself
though
it
was
against
my
wish
sir
that
he
went
into
a
mercantile
house
there
was
something
suppressed
in
this
a
mean
evasion
for
he
could
not
easily
have
told
mr
edgcrton
without
a
blush
that
instead
of
the
mercantile
establishment
he
would
have
made
me
a
bricklayer
s
hodman
but
this
it
seems
edgerton
had
found
out
for
himself
his
reply
however
was
calculated
to
soothe
the
jealous
apprehensions
of
mr
clifford
he
had
an
the
way
in
front
could
nt
escape
me
unless
she
undertook
to
dress
up
all
her
male
acquaintance
in
ruffles
and
false
bosoms
and
let
them
out
through
the
alley
that
might
do
but
i
guess
she
is
nt
up
to
it
since
she
lost
her
husband
she
s
gone
a
little
weak
in
the
head
and
pays
an
extra
cent
on
the
dollar
when
she
is
borrowing
from
mr
fyler
close
these
are
small
gains
and
slow
ones
said
mr
leycraft
you
might
sit
on
spiders
eggs
like
these
for
a
century
and
not
hatch
out
a
fortune
let
s
have
something
bold
and
dashing
something
where
you
put
in
no
capital
and
double
it
to
boot
in
less
than
a
week
something
modelled
on
the
farm
house
affair
eh
said
fyler
close
leering
on
his
companion
significantly
will
you
let
that
subject
alone
if
you
please
mr
fyler
close
cried
mr
leycraft
whose
countenance
darkened
and
lowered
on
his
companion
as
he
spake
we
have
had
talks
enough
about
that
cursed
house
and
one
too
many
i
wish
the
title
deed
was
in
the
right
owner
s
hands
you
do
do
you
urged
mr
close
pleasantly
shall
i
ask
mrs
hetty
lettuce
the
market
woman
when
she
comes
here
next
to
pay
the
rent
or
renew
her
mortgage
if
she
ca
nt
find
him
for
us
perhaps
if
we
paid
her
well
she
might
relieve
us
of
the
property
and
provide
a
very
gentlemanly
owner
in
our
place
shall
we
advertise
offer
rewards
post
placards
i
ve
no
doubt
if
the
purlieus
of
the
city
were
well
dragged
that
an
heir
would
turn
up
stuff
fyler
close
you
know
well
enough
that
an
heir
could
nt
be
brought
alive
off
either
one
of
the
five
continents
that
could
make
good
his
claim
and
that
makes
you
chuckle
so
like
a
fiend
mrs
lettuce
has
lost
trace
of
him
for
more
than
twenty
years
has
grown
fat
and
lazy
borrows
money
on
bond
and
mortgage
and
do
nt
care
a
straw
about
the
subject
where
s
your
grand
project
all
this
time
interposed
fyler
close
shall
we
have
something
new
to
practice
our
wits
on
or
shall
we
rake
among
our
dead
schemes
for
wherewithal
to
warm
our
brains
with
now
that
you
are
on
that
said
mr
leycraft
rapidly
surveying
the
nooks
and
privacies
of
the
apartment
and
bestowing
a
broad
glare
on
the
door
and
windows
i
say
freely
and
without
the
lest
reserve
that
my
head
s
a
nine
pin
if
i
do
nt
lay
a
plan
before
you
will
make
you
thrill
down
to
your
pocket
ends
with
rapture
it
s
a
neat
scheme
very
neat
but
at
the
same
time
mighty
magnificent
saying
this
leycraft
drew
close
up
to
the
side
of
the
broker
laid
their
heads
close
together
and
bending
over
the
stand
he
moved
his
finger
slowly
in
a
sort
of
hieroglyphic
over
it
and
tapping
his
forehead
complacently
was
about
to
detail
his
notable
plan
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
which
cut
short
any
further
communication
for
the
present
the
knock
was
repeated
a
little
louder
fyler
close
motioned
to
his
companion
who
vanished
expeditiously
down
a
pair
of
back
stairs
into
the
yard
looking
anxiously
back
all
the
time
as
if
under
pursuit
and
so
through
the
baker
s
and
close
snatching
from
his
pocket
a
well
worn
hymn
book
began
reciting
a
most
excellent
passage
of
psalmody
in
a
deep
and
nasal
intonation
the
knock
was
repeated
three
or
four
times
before
an
invitation
was
given
to
enter
and
although
the
broker
glanced
over
the
top
of
his
book
as
the
door
opened
and
discovered
his
visitor
he
assumed
not
to
be
conscious
of
the
presence
of
any
person
whatever
but
proceeded
steadily
in
fact
with
rather
increased
energy
in
his
capital
divertisement
please
sir
said
the
visitor
a
stout
built
lady
curtsying
and
advancing
timidly
a
step
or
two
please
sir
what
s
to
be
done
about
the
little
mor
gage
on
my
grounds
sir
this
question
fyler
close
seemed
at
first
altogether
unable
to
apprehend
but
when
it
was
repeated
accompanied
by
a
slight
jingle
of
silver
in
the
visitor
s
pocket
he
started
deposited
his
book
open
upon
the
stand
as
if
he
wished
to
resume
it
at
the
very
earliest
convenience
looked
about
him
and
pensively
remarked
twitching
his
whiskers
of
which
there
was
a
dry
tuft
on
either
cheek
violently
poor
old
man
there
s
no
comfort
left
for
you
now
but
psalm
singing
and
class
meetings
every
other
evening
in
the
week
these
are
old
chairs
madam
they
certainly
are
mr
close
very
old
there
s
no
denying
facts
answered
the
huckster
this
is
a
dreadful
dreary
room
for
an
old
man
to
live
in
again
groaned
the
broker
sartain
responded
the
unwary
market
woman
i
think
in
that
point
to
do
you
justice
it
s
but
next
better
than
a
family
vault
saving
the
death
s
heads
and
the
smell
and
now
you
ask
me
a
poor
lonesome
man
living
like
death
himself
as
you
admit
and
that
can
afford
to
keep
no
better
company
than
three
poor
crazy
chairs
to
renew
your
mortgage
at
seven
per
cent
why
a
cannibal
with
good
cannibal
feelings
would
nt
ask
it
mr
close
on
delivery
of
this
speech
fell
silent
and
dropped
into
a
profound
meditation
during
which
he
from
time
to
time
looked
up
and
eyed
the
stout
person
of
the
huckster
as
if
he
thought
it
would
furnish
a
most
delicate
morsel
for
a
carribee
but
his
own
method
of
devouring
a
victim
differed
essentially
from
that
adopted
by
the
benighted
heathen

wore
the
look
of

but
there
was
a
freezing
calmness
in
his

sighed
deeply
and
then

in
a
tone
of
still
greater
menace

farewell
a
heart
rending
shriek
rang
in
the
sleeper
s
ears
a
mighty
flash
dazzled
his
eyes
and
with
a
grim
smile
upon
his
pallid
countenance
villefort
vanished
monte
cristo
awoke
with
a
quick
start
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
if
dazed
then
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
glanced
breathlessly
about
him
danglars
and
villefort
had
been
only
the
idle
coinage
of
his
brain
but
the
heart
rending
shriek
the
mighty
flash
they
were
indeed
stern
realities
the
shriek
was
haydee
s
and
the
flash
was
fire

god
cried
monte

standing
for
an
instant
rooted
to
the
spot
can
it
be
possible
that
this
dream
is
the
truth
after
all
and
that
i
am
even
now
to
feel
the
vengeance
of
those
two
men
he
sprang
into
the
spacious
hall
that
was
as
light
as
day
and
as
he
did
so
the
figure
of
a
man
rushed
by
him
it
was
benedetto
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
long
knife
dripping
with
blood
the
count
turned
and
pursued
him
snatching
a
dagger
from
a
table
as
he
ran
at
the
door
leading
to
the
lawn
he
grasped
him
firmly
by
the
shoulder
and
held
him

he
shouted
whose
blood
is
that
upon
your
knife
the
blood
of

the
greek
slave
hissed
benedetto
with
a
glare
of
ferocious
triumph
the
blood
of

your
wife
edmond
dantes
i
am
even
with
you
monte

struck
at
the
assassin
with
his
dagger
but
benedetto
eluded
the
blow
and
raising
his
own
weapon
inflicted
a
frightful
gash
upon
the
count
s
cheek
a
terrible
struggle
ensued
monte
cristo
was
possessed
of
wonderful
strength
and
activity
but
in
both
these
respects
the
two
desperate
antagonists
seemed
fairly
matched
three
times
did
the
count
bury
his
dagger
in
benedetto
s
body
but
though
the
assassin
s
blood
gushed
copiously
from
his
wounds
he
continued
to
fight
with
the
utmost
determination
at
length
the
men
grappled
in
a
supreme
deadly
effort
but
monte
cristo
making
a
false
step
slipped
on
the
blood
spattered
marble
floor
and
benedetto
with
the
quickness
of
thought
hurling
him
backward
freed
himself
and
bounding
through
the
open
doorway
vanished
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
count
uttered
a
groan
of
despair
as
he
saw
haydee
s
self
confessed
murderer
escape
him
and
staggered
to
his
feet
the
fierce
conflict
with
benedetto
had
exhausted
him
and
he
stood
for
an
instant
panting
and
breathless
the
shrieks
had
now
grown
fainter
and
the
hall
was
full
of
smoke
during
all
this
time
neither
ali
nor
any
of
the
servants
under
him
had
appeared
a
circumstance
that
to
monte
cristo
seemed
inexplicable
he
however
did
not
pause
to
give
it
thought
but
dashed
up
the
stairway
and
strove
to
reach
his
wife
s
apartment
blinding
stifling
clouds
of
smoke
through
which
penetrated
the
glare
of
the
conflagration
drove
him
back
again
and
again
but
he
renewed
his
attempts
to
force
a
passage
with
undaunted
energy
and
courage
finally
compressing
his
lips
and
holding
his
nostrils
with
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
he
gave
a
headlong
plunge
and
succeeded
in
reaching
haydee
s
door
it
was
open
displaying
a
scene
that
caused
the
count
s
heart
to
sink
within
him
the
whole
chamber
was
one
sea
of
flame
fiery
tongues
like
so
many
writhing
and
hissing
serpents
were
licking
and
consuming
the
costly
tapestry
the
richly
carved
furniture
and
the
magnificent
objects
of
art
the
curtains
of
the
bed
were
blazing
and
upon
the
couch
lay
the
senseless
form
of
the
wife
of
monte
cristo
the
pallor
of
her
faultless
countenance
contrasting
painfully
with
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
devouring
element
in
haydee
s
breast
was
a
gaping
wound
from
which
her
life
blood
was
slowly
oozing
in
ruby
drops
rendered
utterly
reckless
by
the
terrible
sight
the
count
madly
rushed
to
the
couch
tore
his
beloved
haydee
from
it
and
clasping
her
tightly
against
his
bosom
staggered
into
the
corridor
with
his
precious
burden
there
the
smoke
had
increased
in
volume
and
density
but
summoning
all
his
resolution
and
endurance
to
his
aid
he
plunged
through
it
and
finally
was
successful
in
reaching
the
library
then
with
the
swiftness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
the
husband
was
replaced
by
the
father
and
monte
cristo
for
the
first
time
since
haydee
s
shrieks
had
awakened
him
from
his
dream
thought
of
his
children
where
were
they
and
what
had
happened
to
them
the
count
felt
a
cold
perspiration
break
out
upon
his
forehead
and
a
feeling
of
unspeakable
dread
took
entire
possession
of
him
haydee
demanded
immediate
attention
but
esperance
and
zuleika
must
instantly
be
found
and
rescued
at
the
top
of
his
voice
monte
cristo
shouted
for
ali
but
no
reply
was
returned
fearing
to
leave
haydee
for
even
a
moment
the
count
allow
it
after
you
have
proved
first
that
she
is
your
daughter
and
then
that
she
is
not
of
an
age
when
she
is
privileged
to
be
her
own
mistress
that
would
cause
delay
undoubtedly
but
i
think
it
will
be
enough
for
me
to
assure
her
that
you
have
the
legal
power
of
compulsion
and
for
you
to
threaten
its
employment
unless
she
will
go
with
you
at
once
rather
than
submit
to
an
indignity
when
she
finds
that
resistance
is
useless
she
will
consent
to
accompany
you
peaceably
we
will
see
if
you
are
right
but
tell
me
augusta
what
are
your
future
plans
in
regard
to
this
girl
if
she
marries
she
shall
marry
a
man
who
is
not
ashamed
to
take
her
old
mother
by
the
hand
if
she
remains
single
i
mean
to
make
an
actress
of
her
she
has
a
fine
person
and
a
good
voice
i
think
she
would
succeed
on
the
stage
admirably
exclaimed
glenham
his
features
brightening
with
obvious
satisfaction
the
girl
has
talents
and
would
unquestionably
make
a
hit
on
the
stage
she
might
attain
a
more
advantageous
position
than
any
matrimonial
alliance
could
give
her
besides
if
she
married
fleetwood
after
the
effervescence
of
passion
began
to
subside
he
would
reflect
with
dismay
and
regret
upon
the
step
he
had
taken
in
uniting
himself
with
your
family
he
would
begin
by
ill
treating
you
and
end
by
ill
treating
his
wife
then
he
shall
not
have
my
daughter
i
am
resolved
on
that
and
now
let
us
see
if
we
can
induce
adelaide
to
return
with
me
quietly
to
the
city
she
rang
the
bell
and
directed
the
servant
to
inform
miss
adelaide
that
her
mother
wished
to
see
her
in
the
parlor
immediately
chapter
ix
good
night
ah
no
the
hour
is
ill
which
severs
those
it
should
unite
let
us
remain
together
still
then
it
will
be
good
night
shelley
the
second
morning
after
the
party
at
mr
dryman
s
fleetwood
sat
in
the
parlor
of
his
hotel
over
a
cup
of
coffee
and
an
omelette
scanning
the
newspapers
which
had
been
brought
in
withhis
breakfast
as
he
glanced
carelessly
along
the
columns
for
some
paragraph
of
interest
his
attention
was
slightly
awakened
by
one
promising
to
give
some
account
of
recent
movements
in
the
fashionable
world
after
listlessly
perusing
a
few
lines
he
found
that
it
contained
a
sketch
of
the
party
of
the
night
before
he
read
on
and
remarked
his
name
conspicuous
among
those
of
others
who
were
present
the
following
was
the
passage
in
which
it
occurred
the
entrance
of
mr
fleetwood
of
fleetwood
was
the
signal
for
a
general
levelling
of
quizzing
glasses
on
the
part
of
the
ladies
this
young
man
by
the
death
of
both
his
parents
without
other
issue
was
left
at
an
early
age
the
inheritor
of
a
large
and
princely
estate
including
the
noble
place
on
the
banks
of
the
hudson
well
known
by
the
family
name
he
is
good
looking
but
said
to
be
eccentric
and
peculiar
in
his
habits
and
notions
of
life
he
was
no
proof
however
against
the
charms
of
miss
emily
g
who
in
spite
of
the
frowns
and
evident
anger
of
count
la
salle
received
her
new
admirer
with
unequivocal
marks
of
favor
was
it
merely
to
encourage
another
moth
to
singe
its
wings
in
the
candle
flame
one
would
think
that
the
young
lady
had
numbered
victims
enough
both
in
europe
and
in
this
country
she
has
received
offers
without
number
from
the
most
eligible
men
in
society
fleet
wood
is
certainly
a
formidable
competitor
but
he
had
better
look
out
pshaw
muttered
fleetwood
throwing
aside
the
newspaper
with
disdain
and
sipping
his
coffee
as
if
to
take
out
the
taste
of
the
paragraph
what
license
these
pickers
up
of
unconsidered
trifles
for
the
public
maw
assume
with
a
man
s
name
and
character
should
this
impertinent
tittle
tattle
fall
under
adelaide
s
eye
i
am
sure
she
will
prize
it
at
its
worth
re
assured
by
this
conviction
fleetwood
attacked
the
omelette
until
there
was
little
left
of
its
fair
proportions
he
suddenly
paused
and
set
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
next
saturday
soliloquized
he
i
shall
be
a
married
man
have
i
been
hasty
in
taking
this
step
have
i
been
inconsiderate
ah
no
adelaide
is
purity
itself
and
did
i
need
an
excuse
for
our
immediate
union
surely
the
circumstance
of
her
present
position
would
be
enough
but
is
it
pity
that
has
any
weight
in
urging
me
to
this
consummation
tell
me
my
heart
is
it
pity
no
no
is
not
adelaide
my
equal
perhaps
my
superior
in
every
respect
save
those
of
birth
and
fortune
it
is
love
and
love
only
that
impels
me
yes
adelaide
thou
art
the
first
and
shalt
be
the
last
for
whose
sake
that
passion
has
been
awakened
in
my
soul
nor
time
nor
accident
shall
dim
its
ever
full
and
radiant
flame
it
is
something
of
a
bathos
to
descend
from
a
rhapsody
like
this
to
bread
and
butter
but
as
a
candid
chronicler
i
must
confess
that
fleetwood
having
uttered
it
did
take
up
a
piece
of
toast
and
finish
his
breakfast
like
a
man
with
a
good
appetite
he
had
hardly
done
this
when
a
servant
threw
open
the
door
and
announced
mr
gordon
show
him
up
said
fleetwood
the
individual
who
entered
was
a
fine
specimen
of
a
well
preserved
gentleman
about
town
his
features
though
a
little
sunken
about
the
cheeks
were
still
handsome
his
hair
was
slightly
grizzled
about
the
ears
and
a
keen
pair
of
gray
eyes
lent
animation
to
his
face
his
figure
was
erect
and
tall
he
was
dressed
in
unexceptionable
taste
and
there
was
an
air
of
elegance
about
him
which
gave
the
assurance
that
there
was
no
circle
of
gentlemen
in
which
he
would
not
have
been
perfectly
at
his
ease
he
entered
the
room
with
a
free
am
no
apparition
sir
exclaimed
the
stranger
in
a
voice
so
finely
modulated
that
it
might
have
been
easily
taken
for
a
woman
s
but
a
substantial
specimen
of
vigorous
life
who
kindly
bids
you
welcome
to
the
pirates
palace
and
who
then
are
you
exclaimed
the
undaunted
earl
altering
his
voice
to
a
deep
rough
tone
the
stranger
smiled
sardonically
upon
the
group
before
him
as
he
answered
i
am
blackbeard
the
far
famed
pirate
of
the
roanoke
upon
hearing
these
dread
words
sweet
ellen
armstrong
was
obliged
to
lean
tremblingly
for
support
upon
the
arm
of
arthur
huntington
whilst
the
stout
hearted
earl
again
addressed
the
stranger
as
follows
if
you
are
indeed
the
person
whom
you
have
represented
yourself
to
be
learn
that
i
have
often
heard
of
your
murderous
exploits
before
and
i
now
call
upon
you
in
the
name
of
england
s
king
to
surrender
yourself
immediately
to
me
as
my
prisoner
after
giving
utterance
to
a
loud
derisive
laugh
whose
echo
as
it
reverberated
amongst
the
rocky
cliffs
sounded
like
the
fitful
mirth
of
numerous
invisible
demons
the
pirate
thus
answered
the
bold
summons
of
the
earl
you
talk
boldly
for
one
whose
brains
i
might
instantly
scatter
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
know
you
not
that
you
and
your
companions
are
in
my
power
i
know
replied
the
earl
that
i
and
my
companions
by
making
an
easy
signal
can
soon
be
supported
by
an
hundred
stout
hearts
from
yonder
ship
whose
ha
sayst
thou
so
interrupted
the
stranger
i
think
that
they
will
soon
have
other
business
upon
their
hands

our

in
a

manner
it
becomes
necessary
for
us
here
to
briefly
explain
some
important
particulars
relating
to
the
history
of
the
earl
of
derwentwater
and
his
companions
previous
to
their
landing
upon
the
remote
island
of
trinidad
as
related
in
the
course
of
our
first
chapter
the
intelligent
reader
of
history
will
undoubtedly
recollect
that
the
year
two
years
before
the
time
chosen
for
the
commencement
of
our
romance
was
rendered
famous
by
the
important
insurrection
which
then
took
place
throughout
england
and
scotland
in
favor
of
the
chevalier
de
st
george
or
james
the
third
a
proud
and
haughty
scion
of
the
roman
catholic
house
of
stuart
this
singular
and
renowned
rebellion
although
premature
in
its
beginning
and
short
in
its
duration
caused
during
its
continuence
the
hanoverian
incumbent
of
the
english
sceptre
to
tremble
for
the
permanence
of
his
seat
on
the
throne
and
though
he
at
first
pretended
to
despise
both
it
and
its
authors
he
was
finally
compelled
to
use
vigorous
and
extraordinary
means
to
bring
it
to
a
summary
and
fatal
conclusion
through
the
instrumentality
of
foreign
troops
and
the
numerous
cabels
which
sprang
up
in
the
rebel
camp
king
george
was
soon
enabled
to
quell
this
jacobitical
insurrection
which
otherwise
might
have
proved
formidable
enough
to
have
overturned
the
protestant
dynasty
of
the
british
realm
and
established
in
its
place
the
despotic
hierarchy
of
the
church
of
rome
so
well
aware
was
the
reigning
monarch
and
his
ministers
of
the
truth
of
the
above
important
fact
that
they
deemed
it
imperatively
incumbent
upon
them
in
order
to
deal
a
death
blow
to
all
future
attempts
of
the
same
nature
to
punish
all
the
noblemen
and
other
leading
characters
connected
with
it
in
the
most
severe
and
exemplary
manner
acting
upon
the
above
principle
the
privy
council
caused
immediately
to
be
arrested
about
thirty
of
the
scotch
and
english
nobility
the
majority
of
whom
fell
by
the
bloody
axe
of
the
executioner
whilst
the
remainder
were
sentenced
to
perpetual
banishment
amongst
this
latter
class
of
insurgents
was
george
armstrong
earl
of
derwentwater
who
succeeded
to
his
father
s
rank
and
title
immediately
after
his
decease
which
happened
somewhere
about
the
year
some
time
previous
to
his
death
however
the
old
earl
through
his
influence
with
the
crown
had
obtained
the
grant
of
a
large
tract
of
land
in
the
province
of
south
carolina
near
the
mouth
of
the
roanoke
river
which
was
soon
after
settled
by
these
minor
and
remote
branches
of
his
own
extensive
family
whose
fortunes
had
become
sadly
dilapidated
by
the
frequent
intestine
revolutions
which
happened
in
great
britain
during
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
upon
the
accession
of
queen
anne
to
the
english
throne
the
old
earl
fell
into
disgrace
with
the
ministry
and
with
his
family
retired
soon
after
that
event
to
his
plantations
in
america
shortly
after
his
arrival
however
the
change
of
climate
proved
fatal
to
his
advanced
age
and
brought
on
an
intermittent
fever
which
ended
his
life
and
caused
his
only
son
george
armstrong
to
succeed
to
his
grand
title
and
extensive
estates
although
the
character
of
the
young
earl
differed
in
many
important
respects
from
that
of
his
father
still
in
one
great
feature
there
was
an
exact
resemblance
between
them
the
disposition
of
the
old
earl
was
stubborn
artful
and
avaricious
whilst
that
of
his
son
was
frank
open
and
generous
in
temper
the
former
was
cunning
revengeful
and
unforgiving
whilst
that
of
the
latter
though
hasty
and
violent
in
its
outbreaks
would
a
moment
afterwards
pass
away
leaving
no
lingering
trace
of
its
harsh
and
cruel
effect
upon
the
young
earl
s
strong
and
vigorous
mind
here
the
wide
contrast
between
the
characters
of
the
father
and
son
ended
for
the
same
vaulting
ambition
which
had
animated
the
father
through
a
long
and
eventful
life
descended
upon
the
son
in
its
full
and
unstinted
measure
whilst
in
blind
and
extravagant
adherence
to
the
house
of
stuart
and
the
roman
catholic
religion
the
son
greatly
outstripped
the
father
who
had
been
moderate
enough
in
emerged
from
the
house
followed
by
the
family
who
now
gathered
round
the
carriage
to
witness
the
departure
of
those
who
seemed
to
have
succeeded
in
two
brief
hours
in
awakening
an
interest
which
is
usually
created
only
by
a
long
and
intimate
acquaintance
now
mr
amsden
said
the
stranger
turning
to
his
host
after
placing
his
daughter
in
her
seat
now
i
will
settle
with
you
for
the
shoeing
of
the
horse
our
dinners
and
all
other
trouble
to
say
nothing
of
the
hospitable
kindness
with
which
you
all
have
made
us
feel
so
much
at
home
what
sir
will
be
your
bill
ben
what
did
mr
dighton
say
he
should
charge
asked
the
other
turning
to
his
boy
forty
cents
sir
was
the
prompt
reply
well
forty
cents
then
is
the
bill
resumed
the
farmer
yes
but
the
rest
of
your
charges
we
will
trust
you
for
that
i
should
prefer
to
pay
sir
you
may
if
you
will
allow
me
to
direct
the
manner
of
payment
very
well
sir
speak
on
why
when
you
get
settled
down
in
life
again
give
some
other
traveller
a
dinner
if
he
is
as
good
company
as
you
have
been
and
that
shall
square
the
account
between
us
i
will
however
make
your
boys
a
present
better
see
whether
they
will
take
any
thing
first
sir
o
no
no
sir
quickly
interposed
locke
as
the
gentlemen
was
opening
his
purse
not
a
cent
for
me
mister
that
aint
the
way
i
get
my
living
chimed
in
the
spirited
and
proud
little
ben
ah
i
see
you
are
all
determined
to
have
your
way
at
this
time
smilingly
remarked
the
stranger
however
all
may
come
right
hereafter
perhaps
but
as
the
matter
now
stands
i
have
only
to
express
my
sense
of
obligation
to
each
and
all
of
you
and
one
thing
more
before
we
part
mr
amsden
let
me
repeat
to
you
my
advice
to
give
this
elder
son
of
yours
the
chance
for
a
good
education
do
you
think
he
has
capacities
which
would
warrant
such
a
step
sir
asked
the
gratified
mother
of
the
boy
indeed
i
certainly
do
madam
even
to
sending
him
to
a
college
replied
the
other
that
would
be
impossible
in
my
circumstances
provided
i
thought
as
you
do
on
the
subject
remarked
mr
amsden
let
him
go
to
a
good
academy
then
rejoined
the
stranger
well
now
i
do
nt
exactly
know
about
that
replied
the
other
he
may
go
winters
to
our
district
schools
as
long
as
he
pleases
and
i
think
for
the
present
at
least
that
he
should
and
will
be
quite
satisfied
with
that
is
it
not
so
locke
why
answered
the
boy
diffidently
i
should
be
satisfied
to
go
to
our
district
masters
if
they
could
tell
me
the
reasons
of
things
which
i
always
wish
to
know
that
is
right
master
locke
responded
the
stranger
you
have
expressed
in
almost
a
word
the
great
aim
and
essence
of
all
true
knowledge
and
philosophy
to
know
the
reason
of
things
yes
my
young
friend
let
that
still
be
your
ambition
and
if
your
father
will
give
you
the
opportunity
i
doubt
not
you
will
do
honor
to
the
motto
you
have
chosen
well
i
would
be
a
scholar
locke
if
i
was
you
added
mary
with
charming
navet
and
if
you
will
and
come
and
keep
school
where
i
live
i
will
go
to
school
to
you
and
become
a
great
scholar
too
if
i
can
the
travellers
now
took
their
leave
of
the
family
and
drove
from
the
yard
attended
by
the
repeatedly
expressed
good
wishes
of
the
good
hearted
farmer
and
his
equally
kind
and
more
high
minded
companion
and
in
these
wishes
they
were
joined
by
another
who
though
he
had
uttered
less
yet
felt
more
than
they
had
expressed
that
was
our
young
hero
who
as
the
rest
of
the
family
returned
into
the
house
stood
mutely
gazing
after
the
receding
carriage
till
its
last
traces
were
lost
to
his
sight
when
he
slowly
turned
away
the
big
drops
of
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
and
his
lip
quivering
with
emotions
which
had
been
awakened
by
this
brief
but
to
him
as
will
appear
in
the
sequel
important
visit
of
these
interesting
strangers
chapter
ii
the
dream
the
thirst
the
wild
desire
delirious
yet
divine
to
know
bulwer
the
accidental
call
of
the
travellers
at
the
house
of
the
farmer
as
narrated
in
our
opening
chapter
formed
an
era
in
the
life
of
locke
amsden
by
that
call
new
thoughts
had
been
suggested
to
his
mind
new
feelings
and
hopes
awakened
in
his
bosom
and
as
the
slumbering
energies
of
his
intellectual
and
moral
nature
became
thus
aroused
young
ambition
began
to
point
him
upward
to
the
temple
of
science
over
whose
distanced
hallowed
pinnacles
floated
the
mystic
banner
of
fame
at
first
every
word
of
the
revered
stranger
was
recalled
every
position
revolved
over
and
over
in
mind
and
every
argument
carefully
weighed
and
the
result
of
the
process
was
faith
and
conviction
then
came
the
inspiriting
words
of
the
beautiful
little
being
who
in
angel
shape
had
thus
appeared
in
his
path
to
incite
him
onward
and
i
would
be
a
scholar
locke
continued
to
ring
in
his
ears
ay
and
i
will
be
a
scholar
he
at
length
mentally
ejaculated
and
then
i
will
go
where
she
lives
and
she
shall
know
that
i
have
worthily
done
her
bidding
and
justified
the
good
opinion
of
her
father
but
where
does
she
live
yes
where
for
he
now
recollected
that
he
had
not
learned
from
her
or
her
father
the
place
of
their
residence
and
under
the
proud
and
joyous
impulse
which
his
reverie
had
imparted
he
flew
to
his
parents
with
the
inquiry
but
neither
of
them
could
answer
it
they
had
not
ascertained
even
the
family
name
of
their
visiters
mr
amsden
had
thought
of
asking
the
man
these
particulars
but
had
entirely
obscured
the
light
of
the
moon
as
a
caleche
and
four
with
an
extra
postilion
dashed
off
from
the
borg
ognisanti
on
the
mountain
road
towards
bologna
the
inmates
of
the
vehicle
exchanged
not
a
word
the
female
seemed
to
be
affrighted
at
the
headlong
speed
with
which
the
double
team
drew
the
light
caleche
up
the
mountain
s
side
while
a
postilion
sat
so
near
and
the
attendant
at
the
lady
s
side
together
seemed
an
excuse
for
the
silence
even
if
they
were
that
which
any
one
would
have
pronounced
them
a
runaway
couple
anon
the
gentleman
would
offer
some
polite
attention
to
his
companion
but
without
the
exchange
of
a
syllable
and
indeed
words
could
hardly
have
been
heard
at
the
rate
they
were
driving
through
the
dark
on
account
of
the
loud
noise
of
the
wheels
and
horses
feet
among
the
stones
and
uneven
soil
of
the
rising
ground
on
rolled
the
vehicle
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
every
one
knows
how
florentine
horses
can
go
when
they
have
a
mind
to
until
at
length
it
pulled
up
at
a
highland
roadside
inn
of
most
uninviting
character
the
lady
was
immediately
assisted
in
silence
from
the
vehicle
and
scarcely
had
they
entered
the
low
dark
parlor
of
the
inn
before
the
gentleman
whispered
to
her
the
priest
is
here
and
will
unite
us
immediately
but
why
this
haste
dear
carlton
said
florinda
for
it
was
her
there
is
no
time
to
lose
was
the
whispered
response
but
should
not
hush
florinda
but
carlton
he
is
here
was
the
whispered
interruption
and
in
a
moment
more
a
priest
made
his
appearance
and
without
giving
either
time
to
unrobe
themselves
had
they
been
so
inclined
commenced
the
marriage
service
the
ring
was
given
in
that
dark
room
so
dark
that
the
features
even
of
the
minister
of
the
church
could
not
be
discerned
the
prayer
was
made
and
the
two
were
solemnly
declared
to
be
husband
and
wife
the
lady
had
essayed
several
times
to
speak
aloud
as
we
have
seen
to
express
some
feeling
or
wish
and
she
seemed
as
if
anticipating
some
encouragement
from
him
she
was
about
to
wed
but
she
was
each
time
hushed
by
the
speed
with
which
everything
was
done
or
by
a
gentle
whisper
from
her
companion
the
ceremony
completed
the
signora
drew
back
to
a
chair
overcome
by
her
swift
ride
and
the
emotions
that
crowded
themselves
upon
her
throbbing
and
trembling
heart
at
this
moment
there
entered
the
apartment
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
apparently
advanced
is
years
who
turning
his
back
upon
florinda
conversed
for
a
moment
with
the
bridegroom
then
both
turning
towards
florinda
at
the
moment
a
couple
of
lamps
were
introduced
into
the
room
when
lo
she
beheld
before
her
signor
latrezzi
her
uncle
and
her
husband
petro
giampetti
with
a
scream
of
horror
and
affright
she
fell
fainting
upon
the
floor
the
uncle
and
nephew
were
both
filled
with
horror
for
both
believed
that
they
had
killed
her
as
they
gazed
upon
her
pale
and
lifeless
form
either
would
lave
sacrificed
everything
to
have
taken
all
back
again
and
restored
her
to
life
and
happiness
can
this
be
thee
petro
giampetti
trembling
like
a
child
nay
a
tear
actually
wetting
that
swarthy
check
as
you
chafe
the
pulse
and
bathe
the
temples
of
that
insensible
girl
and
hast
thou
really
so
tender
a
heart
and
yet
couldst
enter
into
so
hard
hearted
a
conspiracy
and
thou
signor
latrezzi
well
mayst
thou
hide
thy
face
in
thy
hands
for
thou
art
the
greatest
sinner
here
thine
has
been
the
hand
that
hath
done
this
that
hath
triumphed
over
this
poor
girl
whom
thou
shouldst
have
protected
holy
virgin
cried
petro
she
s
dead
say
not
so
eagerly
exclaimed
her
uncle
god
forgive
us
answered
petro
ay
we
have
need
of
forgiveness
if
we
have
brought
on
such
extremity
said
the
uncle
trying
to
raise
the
lifeless
head
of
their
inanimate
victim
leaving
the
guilty
nephew
and
uncle
for
a
while
we
will
take
the
reader
back
for
a
moment
in
the
thread
of
our
story
chapter
xi
the
intercepted
letter
any
man
that
can
write
may
answer
a
letter
romeo
and
juliet
in
such
a
tale
as
we
now
tell
you
gentle
reader
and
when
written
within
such
limits
it
is
impossible
to
keep
each
portion
of
the
plot
equally
advanced
or
rather
not
to
anticipate
certain
results
there
is
also
an
advantage
in
this
mode
of
arrangement
which
perhaps
is
in
itself
sufficient
excuse
for
the
author
it
heightens
the
plot
and
renders
it
more
absorbing
to
the
reader
by
suddenly
laying
before
him
some
startling
tableau
and
seeming
inconsistency
but
which
the
sequel
of
the
story
renders
plain
and
reconcilable
with
other
portions
of
the
story
having
said
thus
much
for
the
scene
we
have
presented
to
the
reader
at
the
roadside
inn
on
the
apennines
we
must
now
go
back
with
him
to
the
night
on
which
carlton
delivered
his
letter
of
arrangement
to
florinda
and
thus
render
our
tale
plain
to
the
comprehension
of
all
carlton
as
we
have
said
perfected
his
plan
for
the
proposed
elopement
and
in
another
letter
to
florinda
he
communicated
the
particulars
delivering
the
missive
with
his
own
hands
as
heretofore
there
was
a
certain
hour
agreed
upon
between
them
in
which
signora
florinda
was
to
be
at
the
balcony
of
her
apartment
every
evening
and
thus
although
carlton
might
not
be
able
to
hold
much
conversation
with
her
yet
he
could
deliver
any
written
paper
he
might
desire
without
the
fear
of
interruption
or
detection
it
was
necessary
to
accomplish
all
with
the
utmost
secrecy
in
order
to
ensure
success
now
petro
had
been
led
to
suspect
by
some
circumstances
that
the
meetings
between
carlton
and
his
cousin
had
been
renewed
he
determined
to
ascertain
if
this
was
the
case
through
his
own
personal
observation
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
the
cup
of
joy
was
raised
to
my
eager
lips
and
i
was
about
to
quaff
its
bewildering
contents
to
be
balked
by
the
unexpected
entrance
of
that
accused
chevalier
confusion
i
shall
go
mad
with
vexation
well
tis
of
no
use
to
grumble
about
what
ca
nt
be
helped
let
me
rather
turn
my
attention
to
future
joys
concerning
which
there
can
be
no
disappointment
my
plans
are
all
arranged
in
a
few
days
my
pretty
fanny
aubrey
will
be
an
inmate
of
the
luxurious
chambers
of
love
ha
ha
that
thought
almost
reconciles
me
to
the
loss
of
the
duchess
though
egad
she
is
a
luscious
piece
all
fire
all
sentiment
all
enthusiasm
but
oh
five
thousand
dollars
five
thousand
dollars
but
let
me
see
where
is
the
infernal
trap
of
that
scoundrel
jew
mike
whom
sow
nance
recommended
as
a
fellow
well
qualified
to
abduct
my
pretty
fanny
and
convey
her
to
the
chambers
ah
good
his
address
is
in
my
memorandum
book
inquire
for
the
pig
pen
no
ann
street
any
night
after
midnight
ugh
i
do
nt
like
this
venturing
among
cut
throats
and
thieves
at
such
untimely
hours
but
nothing
risk
nothing
have
and
anything
for
love
the
reader
s
attention
is
now
summoned
to
the
scene
which
transpired
between
the
chevalier
and
the
duchess
immediately
after
the
departure
of
mr
tickels
from
the
house
the
duchess
who
had
been
sitting
upon
the
sofa
bathed
in
tears
and
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
jumped
up
bounded
across
the
carpet
in
a
series
of
graceful
pirouettes
and
then
throwing
herself
upon
the
floor
indulged
in
a
peal
of
silvery
laughter
that
made
the
room
fairly
echo
exclaiming
what
a
d
d
old
fool
that
man
is
oh
i
shall
die
i
shall
positively
suffocate
with
mirth
the
chevalier
throwing
aside
every
appearance
of
indignation
and
dignity
placed
himself
in
that
humorous
and
rather
vulgar
position
sometimes
adopted
by
jocose
youths
who
wish
to
intimate
to
their
friends
the
fact
that
any
individual
has
been
most
egregiously
sucked
in
fearing
that
the
uninitiated
may
not
readily
comprehend
this
pantomimic
witticism
we
may
as
well
state
for
their
enlightenment
that
it
is
accomplished
by
applying
the
thumb
to
the
tip
of
the
nose
and
executing
a
series
of
gyrations
with
the
open
hand
the
whole
affair
being
a
very
playful
and
ingenious
invention
much
practised
by
newsboys
cabmen
second

dealers
and
sporting
gentlemen
a
cool
five
thousand
shouted
the
chevalier
abandoning
this
comic
picture
and
squaring
off
at
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
in
the
most
approved
style
of
the
pugilistic
art
as
if
he
were
about
to
give
himself
a
punch
in
the
head
for
being
such
a
funny
clever
dog
bravo
i
ll
go
and
get
the
cheque
cashed
at
once
and
then
hurrah
for
a
brilliant
season
of
glorious
dissipation
but
my
duchess
how
the
devil
did
you
mange
to
get
the
old
fool
so
infatuated
so
crazy
with
passion
for
i
stood
over
ten
minutes
looking
at
both
of
you
through
the
key
hole
before
i
entered
the
room
and
i
never
before
saw
a
man
act
so
extravagantly
ludicrous
it
was
only
with
extreme
difficulty
that
i
could
keep
myself
from
laughing
outright
and
you
witch
that
you
are
looked
as
if
you
were
panting
and
dying
with
amorous
desires
by
my
soul
twas
admirably
done
the
duchess
smiled
with
gratification
at
the
praise
and
arising
from
the
carpet
on
which
she
had
been
literally
rolling
in
the
excess
of
her
mirth
threw
herself
upon
the
sofa
in
an
attitude
of
voluptuous
abandonment
and
while
complacently
viewing
her
matchless
leg
she
said
for
your
especial
entertainment
my
chevalier
i
will
relate
all
that
transpired
between
me
and
the
old
goat
after
your
departure
at
first
he
assailed
me
with
a
profusion
of
silly
sickening
compliments
on
my
beauty
i
blushed
you
know
how
well
i
can
blush
when
i
try
and
assured
him
that
his
praises
were
divine
so
eloquent
so
elegantly
conveyed
and
yet
i
thought
them
intolerably
stupid
then
i
gave
him
my
hand
to
kiss
and
its
contact
with
his
lips
made
him
as
amorous
as
i
could
possibly
desire
he
knelt
at
my
feet
then
arose
apologizing
for
his
rudeness
i
threw
all
my
powers
of
fascination
into
my
looks
and
permitted
him
to
take
a
seat
by
my
side
on
the
sofa
at
first
he
sat
apart
from
me
but
at
last
gaining
courage
he
moved
close
to
me
and
gently
placed
his
arm
around
my
waist
of
course
i
did
not
repulse
him
with
secret
joy
i
observed
the
eagerness
with
which
he
regarded
such
parts
of
my
person
as
were
exposed
and
i
took
good
care
to
reveal
it
liberally
how
the
odious
old
wretch
gloated
upon
this
bust
which
you
my
chevalier
pronounce
so
charming
at
last
he
kissed
me
ugh
how
horribly
the
old
creature
s
breath
smelt
but
i
pretended
to
be
more
pleased
than
angry
and
from
my
lips
his
nauseous
mouth
wandered
to
my
neck
my
shoulders
my
bosom
i
fairly
shuddered
as
he
besmeared
me
with
his
disgusting
kisses
and
thinking
that
he
had
gone
far
enough
for
that
time
i
burst
from
his
embrace
and
reproached
him
but
not
too
severely
for
his
rude
behavior
taking
good
care
however
to
fan
his
passions
into
a
still
fiercer
flame
by
telling
him
that
my
reason
for
particularly
dreading
such
familiarities
was
that
they
had
a
tendency
to
excite
my
own
desires
to
a
degree
that
was
dangerous
to
my
honor
as
i
foresaw
this
artful
assurance
was
received
by
him
with
ill
concealed
delight
he
begged
my
pardon
it
is
needless
to
say
i
forgave
him
and
suffered
him
to
resume
his
seat
at
my
side
on
condition
that
he
would
take
no
further
liberties
knowing
very
well
that
he
could
not
long
keep
his
promise
then
came
more
compliments
i
sang
and
played
for
and
hailing
the
pequod
to
give
notice
of
his
intentions
at
once
proceeded
to
reap
the
fruit
of
his
unrighteous
cunning
seizing
his
sharp
boat
spade
he
commenced
an
excavation
in
the
body
a
little
behind
the
side
fin
you
would
almost
have
thought
he
was
digging
a
cellar
there
in
the
sea
and
when
at
length
his
spade
struck
against
the
gaunt
ribs
it
was
like
turning
up
old
roman
tiles
and
pottery
buried
in
fat
english
loam
his
boat
s
crew
were
all
in
high
excitement
eagerly
helping
their
chief
and
looking
as
anxious
as
gold
hunters
and
all
the
time
numberless
fowls
were
diving
and
ducking
and
screaming
and
yelling
and
fighting
around
them
stubb
was
beginning
to
look
disappointed
especially
as
the
horrible
nosegay
increased
when
suddenly
from
out
the
very
heart
of
this
plague
there
stole
a
faint
stream
of
perfume
which
flowed
through
the
tide
of
bad
smells
without
being
absorbed
by
it
as
one
river
will
flow
into
and
then
along
with
another
without
at
all
blending
with
it
for
a
time
i
have
it
i
have
it
cried
stubb
with
delight
striking
something
in
the
subterranean
regions
a
purse
a
purse
dropping
his
spade
he
thrust
both
hands
in
and
drew
out
handfuls
of
something
that
looked
like
ripe
windsor
soap
or
rich
mottled
old
cheese
very
unctuous
and
savory
withal
you
might
easily
dent
it
with
your
thumb
it
is
of
a
hue
between
yellow
and
ash
colour
and
this
good
friends
is
ambergris
worth
a
gold
guinea
an
ounce
to
any
druggist
some
six
handfuls
were
obtained
but
more
was
unavoidably
lost
in
the
sea
and
still
more
perhaps
might
have
been
secured
were
it
not
for
impatient
ahab
s
loud
command
to
stubb
to
desist
and
come
on
board
else
the
ship
would
bid
them
good
bye
chapter
ambergris
now
this
ambergris
is
a
very
curious
substance
and
so
important
as
an
article
of
commerce
that
in
a
certain
nantucket
born
captain
coffin
was
examined
at
the
bar
of
the
english
house
of
commons
on
that
subject
for
at
that
time
and
indeed
until
a
comparatively
late
day
the
precise
origin
of
ambergris
remained
like
amber
itself
a
problem
to
the
learned
though
the
word
ambergris
is
but
the
french
compound
for
grey
amber
yet
the
two
substances
are
quite
distinct
for
amber
though
at
times
found
on
the
sea
coast
is
also
dug
up
in
some
far
inland
soils
whereas
ambergris
is
never
found
except
upon
the
sea
besides
amber
is
a
hard
transparent
brittle
odorless
substance
used
for
mouth
pieces
to
pipes
for
beads
and
ornaments
but
ambergris
is
soft
waxy
and
so
highly
fragrant
and
spicy
that
it
is
largely
used
in
perfumery
in
pastiles
precious
candles
hair
powders
and
pomatum
the
turks
use
it
in
cooking
and
also
carry
it
to
mecca
for
the
same
purpose
that
frankincense
is
carried
to
st
peter
s
in
rome
some
wine
merchants
drop
a
few
grains
into
claret
to
flavor
it
who
would
think
then
that
such
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
should
regale
themselves
with
an
essence
found
in
the
inglorious
bowels
of
a
sick
whale
yet
so
it
is
by
some
ambergris
is
supposed
to
be
the
cause
and
by
others
the
effect
of
the
dyspepsia
in
the
whale
how
to
cure
such
a
dyspepsia
it
were
hard
to
say
unless
by
administering
three
or
four
boat
loads
of
brandreth
s
pills
and
then
running
out
of
harm
s
way
as
laborers
do
in
blasting
rocks
i
have
forgotten
to
say
that
there
were
found
in
this
ambergris
certain
hard
round
bony
plates
which
at
first
stubb
thought
might
be
sailors
trowsers
buttons
but
it
afterwards
turned
out
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
pieces
of
small
squid
bones
embalmed
in
that
manner
now
that
the
incorruption
of
this
most
fragrant
ambergris
should
be
found
in
the
heart
of
such
decay
is
this
nothing
bethink
thee
of
that
saying
of
st
paul
in
corinthians
about
corruption
and
incorruption
how
that
we
are
sown
in
dishonour
but
raised
in
glory
and
likewise
call
to
mind
that
saying
of
paracelsus
about
what
it
is
that
maketh
the
best
musk
also
forget
not
the
strange
fact
that
of
all
things
of
ill
savor
cologne
water
in
its
rudimental
manufacturing
stages
is
the
worst
i
should
like
to
conclude
the
chapter
with
the
above
appeal
but
cannot
owing
to
my
anxiety
to
repel
a
charge
often
made
against
whalemen
and
which
in
the
estimation
of
some
already
biased
minds
might
be
considered
as
indirectly
substantiated
by
what
has
been
said
of
the
frenchman
s
two
whales
elsewhere
in
this
volume
the
slanderous
aspersion
has
been
disproved
that
the
vocation
of
whaling
is
throughout
a
slatternly
untidy
business
but
there
is
another
thing
to
rebut
they
hint
that
all
whales
always
smell
bad
now
how
did
this
odious
stigma
originate
i
opine
that
it
is
plainly
traceable
to
the
first
arrival
of
the
greenland
whaling
ships
in
london
more
than
two
centuries
ago
because
those
whalemen
did
not
then
and
do
not
now
try
out
their
oil
at
sea
as
the
southern
ships
have
always
done
but
cutting
up
the
fresh
blubber
in
small
bits
thrust
it
through
the
bung
holes
of
large
casks
and
carry
it
home
in
that
manner
the
shortness
of
the
season
in
those
icy
seas
and
the
sudden
and
violent
storms
to
which
they
are
exposed
forbidding
any
other
course
the
consequence
is
that
upon
breaking
into
the
hold
and
unloading
one
of
these
whale
cemeteries
in
the
greenland
dock
a
savor
is
given
forth
somewhat
similar
to
that
arising
from
excavating
an
old
city
grave
yard
for
the
foundations
of
a
lying
in
hospital
i
partly
surmise
also
that
this
wicked
charge
against
whalers
may
be
likewise
imputed
to
the
existence
on
the
coast
of
greenland
in
former
times
of
a
dutch
village
called
schmerenburgh
or
smeerenberg
which
latter
name
is
the
one
used
by
the
