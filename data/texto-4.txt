for
ever
tears
precious
tears
though
you
scald
my
eyelids
with
your
bitterness
yet
do
you
show
that
guilt
has
not
placed
an
eternal
barrier
between
me
and
penitence
but
away
deceptive
cheat
shall
i
plunge
into
the
dark
abyss
with
the
accents
of
false
hope
lingering
on
my
lips
rather
let
my
thoughts
return
to
thee
glenthorne
for
thee
i
die
content
and
though
all
the
world
condemn
thee
yet
doth
my
heart
cling
to
thee
with
greater
fondness
i
know
not
i
care
not
that
i
love
thee
whatever
thou
art
how
often
have
i
sung
thee
this
ditty
but
how
little
did
i
anticipate
the
aptness
of
the
allusion
but
see
the
index
points
to
the
hour
of
twelve
and
dear
dear
glenthorne
i
come
i
come
the
vial
is
in
my
hand
as
it
is
in
thine
poor
poor
child
who
will
guard
thee
come
what
will
thou
canst
not
be
more
miserable
than
thou
wouldst
have
been
with
thy
wretched
protectors
the
deed
is
done
oh
mercy
mercy
mercy
thus
closed
this
record
of
the
last
throbs
of
a
broken
heart
in
which
conflicting
passions
struggled
so
fearfully
let
us
draw
a
veil
over
her
errors
and
leave
them
both
in
the
hands
of
their
creator
we
learn
that
the
deceased
had
resided
in
this
city
but
a
few
weeks
and
that
an
individual
named
maddox
on
whose
information
the
have
shed
light
on
their
former
history
but
strange
to
say
he
no
sooner
was
apprized
of
their
melancholy
end
than
he
removed
his
baggage
from
the
house
in
which
he
boarded
and
after
the
most
diligent
search
we
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
his
retreat
or
to
what
circumstance
to
attribute
his
sudden
disappearance
the
child
thus
left
an
orphan
among
strangers
is
a
beautiful
and
interesting
boy
of
about
three
years
of
age
and
we
are
pleased
to
learn
that
an
industrious
cartman
named
clifton
and
his
wife
who
occupied
apartments
under
the
same
roof
with
glenthorne
have
humanely
determined
to
take
charge
of
the
little
surviver
from
some
trinkets
found
in
a
bundle
by
the
side
of
the
child
it
is
conjectured
that
either
the
female
or
her
companion
or
both
are
of
a
wealthy
family
as
there
are
two
or
three
ornaments
of
great
value
which
would
scarcely
have
been
purchased
to
decorate
an
infant
unless
the
parents
were
at
some
period
in
the
possession
thus
change
the
forms
of
being
thus
arise
races
of
living
things
glorious
in
strength
and
perish
as
the
quickening
breath
of
god
fills
them
or
is
withdrawn
bryant
years
that
stamp
their
impress
on
individuals
and
communities
had
swept
along
since
the
events
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapters
causing
in
their
flight
more
than
the
ordinary
changes
incidental
to
the
monuments
of
human
enterprise
in
the
city
and
its
environs
commodious
warehouses
whose
dimensions
were
considered
sufficiently
ample
for
the
most
extensive
mercantile
transactions
had
given
place
to
erections
of
increased
magnitude
and
elegance
and
mansions
which
the
favourites
of
fortune
had
exhibited
as
the
ne
plus
ultra
of
fashion
and
splendour
were
eclipsed
by
ranges
of
princely
edifices
in
which
amplitude
and
magnificence
struggled
for
mastery
the
dense
population
whose
numbers
were
a
fruitful
theme
of
astonishment
to
visitants
from
more
circumscribed
neighbouring
cities
and
villages
had
become
swallowed
up
in
the
vortex
of
a
mightier
crowd
while
the
vicissitudes
attendant
on
commercial
pursuits
had
stricken
the
indigent
to
the
apex
of
wealth
and
luxury
in
that
portion
of
the
island
known
as
the
remote
suburbs
cultivated
fields
to
the
extent
of
thousands
of
acres
that
paid
the
husbandman
a
rich
harvest
for
their
tillage
now
served
for
the
foundation
of
squares
of
costly
dwellings
and
the
tillers
of
the
soil
were
fain
to
settle
down
into
the
character
of
citizens
or
secure
the
enjoyment
of
their
favourite
occupation
in
more
distant
localities
the
rapid
strides
that
fashion
and
luxury
had
made
among
the
wealthier
class
of
citizens
were
also
eminently
conspicuous
in
the
splendour
and
richness
of
their
equipages
in
the
beautiful
street
known
as
broadway
on
a
pleasant
morning
an
immense
number
of
dashing
vehicles
of
all
descriptions
rattled
over
the
pavement
their
exquisitely
polished
exteriors
flashing
back
the
sunbeams
or
with
mirror
like
fidelity
reflecting
the
forms
of
the
passers
by
the
high
mettled
steeds
curvetting
and
prancing
with
arched
necks
and
flowing
manes
the
postillions
and
outriders
decorated
with
gay
liveries
and
if
no
coronet
crested
the
armorial
bearings
that
blazoned
from
some
fair
occupant
might
serve
to
attest
at
least
her
regret
at
the
absence
of
the
courtly
emblem
over
every
avenue
of
literature
and
science
the
chariot
wheels
of
improvement
had
rolled
with
irresistible
velocity
overturning
ancient
landmarks
in
their
career
and
scattering
on
either
hand
new
guide
posts
to
immortality
the
antiquated
process
of
fathoming
the
depths
of
human
character
by
a
long
experience
of
its
practical
effects
on
the
life
and
morals
was
superseded
by
an
inspection
of
the
inequalities
that
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
cranium
while
arts
whose
labyrinths
the
student
had
heretofore
occupied
years
in
exploring
through
the
agency
of
newlight
instructors
were
rendered
obvious
even
to
common
intellects
in
the
space
of
as
many
hours
but
among
all
the
wonders
of
the
day
the
perfection
that
had
been
attained
in
the
healing
art
was
the
most
astounding
practitioners
had
arisen
and
were
established
in
every
street
whose
prescriptions
triumphed
over
the
covert
or
open
assaults
of
disease
in
whatever
form
it
exhibited
itself
and
if
death
thereafter
displayed
his
sanguinary
banner
over
and
obstinacy
of
the
victims
in
not
swallowing
the
pills
and
boluses
was
to
be
attributed
the
fatal
issue
of
their
distemper
if
such
transformations
were
visible
in
the
city
itself
it
is
difficult
to
mark
the
change
that
had
been
wrought
in
the
environs
without
subjecting
ourselves
to
the
charge
of
employing
the
language
of
hyperbole
overlooking
the
twin
rivers
that
with
their
islands
encircle
the
queen
her
fingers
lightly
on
the
paper
which
lay
in
the
window
to
please
me
very
well
be
it
so
who
could
have
believed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
that
i
should
have
had
to
coax
you
to
send
a
line
to
robert
lester
you
may
well
hide
your
telltale
face
kate
bent
her
head
over
the
gilded
to
make
characters
with
her
pencil
when
grace
impatient
at
her
slow
progress
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
exclaimed
why
what
are
you
writing
lester
robert
robert
lester
robert
lester
lester
rob
kate
glanced
at
what
she
had
written
hastily
run
her
pencil
through
it
and
said
with
a
mortified
laugh
i
had
forgotten
what
to
write
and
so
put
down
what
was
deepest
in
your
memory
said
grace
with
a
vexatious
air
now
take
this
fair
page
and
write
as
i
repeat
he
who
shall
bring
again
this
gift
of
love
to
her
who
sends
it
shall
with
love
be
met
is
it
written
letter
for
letter
and
you
will
find
that
each
letter
will
act
as
a
charm
never
so
few
monosyllables
as
i
have
strung
together
here
held
so
much
magic
who
will
be
its
bearer
kate
now
inquired
in
a
lively
and
swift
she
said
folding
the
locket
in
the
billet
this
gage
d
amour
was
oval
in
shape
of
plain
gold
with
a
chased
rim
a
little
raised
enclosing
an
azure
field
on
which
in
exquisite
enamel
were
inlaid
the
crests
of
lester
and
bellamont
joined
together
by
two
clasped
hands
beneath
was
the
sanguine
motto
durante
vit
now
coz
for
one
of
your
raven
ringlets
to
bind
around
it
no
i
will
not
grace
then
i
will
tie
it
with
a
lock
of
my
own
hair
she
said
in
a
sportive
manner
running
her
fingers
through
her
auburn
tresses
and
selecting
one
that
was
like
a
silken
braid
for
its
soft
and
shining
texture
she
prepared
to
sever
it
from
her
temples
you
provoking
child
you
will
have
your
own
way
said
kate
shaking
forward
the
dark
cloud
of
her
abundant
hair
and
intwining
her
finger
in
a
jetty
tress
that
and
glossy
wing
half
an
hour
since
you
verily
would
have
parted
with
every
lock
to
be
assured
the
sacrifice
would
bring
him
to
you
and
now
forsooth
scarcely
will
you
part
with
a
strand
to
bind
a
note
there
she
added
clipping
a
beautiful
ringlet
that
kate
had
selected
from
the
rest
now
all
that
is
wanted
is
wax
no
not
that
i
will
fasten
it
with
a
true
lover
s
knot
which
will
be
far
better
will
it
not
coz
as
she
said
this
she
looked
up
with
a
bright
light
dancing
in
her
dark
hazel
eyes
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
in
a
few
seconds
tied
with
great
gravity
the
mysterious
knot
she
had
mentioned
and
gave
the
billet
to
her
cousin
for
the
superscription
write
these
to
the
hands
of
robert
lord
lester
of
castle
more
greeting
she
said
with
gravity
nay
i
will
direct
it
simply
lester
castle
by
which
said
grace
laughing
you
avoid
the
distant
respect
conveyed
in
my
own
on
the
one
hand
and
the
tenderness
that
is
ready
to
gush
from
your
heart
on
the
other
love
certainly
does
make
his
votaries
skilful
tacticians
truly
now
is
not
this
a
proper
love
billet
written
in
a
lattice
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
tied
with
a
braid
of
the
lady
s
hair
in
a
true
love
knot
well
when
i
am
in
love
i
shall
know
how
to
manage
rightly
all
these
little
affairs
who
is
to
be
our
mercury
on
this
occasion
inquired
kate
with
a
little
doubt
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
i
fear
we
shall
have
to
trust
it
to
a
moonbeam
also
something
more
substantial
i
assure
you
said
the
good
humoured
maiden
in
a
very
positive
manner
not
one
of
the
menials
for
the
world
no
no
she
answered
with
quickness
and
very
mysteriously
the
very
homely
monosyllable
mark
that
proud
boy
he
become
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
lester
she
exclaimed
looking
at
her
with
surprise
for
me
he
will
replied
grace
confidently
two
such
spirits
to
come
in
contact
no
no
have
you
forgotten
how
they
parted
to
day
no
then
why
do
you
propose
so
wild
a
scheme
mark
will
do
as
i
bid
him
she
said
with
a
nave
and
pertinaciousness
that
was
wholly
irresistible
kate
burst
into
such
a
merry
musical
peal
of
laughter
that
at
first
the
maiden
looked
very
grave
but
at
length
found
it
in
vain
to
withhold
her
sympathy
and
laughed
with
her
while
the
rich
blood
mounted
to
her
cheeks
and
invested
her
with
surpassing
beauty
oh
oh
cried
kate
triumphantly
so
you
are
a
very
little
in
love
i
half
guessed
it
doubtless
of
you
very
well
cousin
you
may
think
what
you
choose
she
replied
adding
in
a
tone
and
manner
that
left
her
cousin
in
doubt
if
she
were
not
half
in
earnest
but
if
i
were
in
love
with
him
is
he
not
noble
in
person
handsome
gallant
and
brave
why
may
he
not
be
worthy
a
noble
maiden
s
love
i
would
not
give
him
as
he
is
for
lester
with
all
his
nobility
coupled
as
it
is
with
his
terrible
passions
out
upon
you
jade
said
kate
good
humouredly
will
you
revile
in
this
vein
my
noble
lester
compare
him
to
a
fisher
s
lad
where
is
your
pride
of
birth
and
rank
grace
fitzgerald
really
i
should
not
wonder
if
with
your
levelling
notions
you
should
some
day
throw
yourself
away
upon
some
one
unworthy
to
wear
so
fair
and
rich
a
flower
in
his
bosom
i
have
both
wealth
that
i
will
give
my
hand
where
my
heart
goes
you
may
rest
assured
cousin
kate
said
the
maiden
with
spirited
yet
sportive
decision
marry
come
up
i
shall
not
wonder
if
i
come
to
be
cousin
to
a
cordwainer
captured
and
nearly
murdered
my
wife
and
infant
child
yourself
my
dear
son
had
accompanied
me
we
had
a
pitched
battle
with
a
detachment
of
the
enemy
commanded
by
the
very
wahquimacutt
or
captain
white
cat
who
figured
in
the
early
part
of
this
sketch
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
single
him
out
and
to
repay
the
ancient
grudge
i
bore
him
i
was
unsuccessful
the
subtle
villain
evaded
me
his
party
were
routed
and
i
saw
him
no
more
on
the
termination
of
the
battle
my
wife
encountered
me
with
streaming
eyes
she
informed
me
that
you
had
been
stolen
from
that
her
frantic
supplications
had
been
disregarded
by
the
inhuman
robber
and
that
she
had
in
vain
implored
death
from
his
hands
she
gave
me
a
description
of
the
kidnapper
of
our
cherished
infant
and
i
felt
convinced
that
the
scoundrel
was
no
other
than
wahquimacutt
accompanied
by
several
of
my
most
trusty
warriors
i
commenced
the
strictest
search
after
being
baffled
however
for
several
days
i
was
obliged
to
relinquish
all
hope
and
we
returned
mournfully
to
our
abode
after
several
months
had
elapsed
i
received
information
while
engaged
in
a
war
party
which
led
me
into
the
interior
of
massachusetts
that
the
white
cat
had
found
means
to
deliver
my
child
to
my
brother
joshua
the
subtle
villain
had
learned
from
what
source
i
know
not
a
large
portion
of
my
early
history
his
savage
nature
led
him
naturally
to
suppose
that
he
could
not
confer
a
greater
favour
on
my
brother
than
thus
to
enable
him
to
wreak
the
vengeance
he
owed
the
father
upon
his
large
reward
and
the
gratification
derived
from
thus
wounding
me
in
the
tenderest
point
were
sufficient
inducements
for
this
piece
of
villany
on
the
part
of
wahquimacutt
i
know
not
whether
my
brother
joshua
learned
then
for
the
first
time
that
the
redoubtable
patanko
whose
renown
filled
the
colony
was
no
other
than
his
unfortunate
and
guilty
brother
at
any
rate
he
found
means
to
inform
me
that
he
had
received
my
infant
and
although
time
and
meditation
had
both
taught
him
that
he
neither
could
nor
ought
to
forgive
the
manifold
crimes
which
had
been
productive
of
so
much
misery
to
himself
yet
he
was
willing
to
adopt
and
cherish
the
child
received
in
so
wonderful
a
manner
for
the
sake
he
bitterly
added
of
saving
it
from
the
contamination
of
its
father
if
i
was
willing
to
relinquish
all
pretensions
to
him
he
pledged
me
his
honour
that
he
would
educate
and
bountifully
provide
for
him
but
that
if
i
refused
my
consent
he
was
ready
to
restore
the
infant
in
any
he
urged
me
however
to
relinquish
my
claims
with
much
eloquence
and
made
use
of
all
possible
arguments
to
convince
me
that
the
welfare
of
the
child
would
be
more
consulted
by
placing
him
within
the
reach
of
civilization
than
by
suffering
him
to
grow
up
a
blood
thirsty
and
savage
indian
on
receiving
this
information
i
wrestled
long
and
desperately
with
myself
the
longing
to
see
you
my
son
whom
i
loved
beyond
the
whole
world
beside
was
opposed
to
the
irresistible
conviction
that
my
brother
had
counselled
well
although
i
considered
my
own
lot
in
life
irrecoverably
cast
and
neither
hoped
nor
wished
for
any
farther
change
yet
i
knew
too
well
and
abhorred
too
utterly
the
indian
character
to
endure
with
composure
the
prospect
of
my
son
s
growing
up
a
savage
and
untutored
denizen
of
the
wilderness
after
a
desperate
conflict
with
myself
i
decided
as
i
was
ever
afterwards
convinced
for
the
best
i
contrived
to
convey
to
my
brother
my
permission
to
retain
you
adopted
home
some
years
after
this
in
the
course
of
the
year
i
received
from
the
english
general
who
commanded
in
the
northern
provinces
during
the
french
war
which
was
then
raging
a
highly
important
commission
i
was
engaged
to
take
command
of
a
large
body
of
indians
and
provincial
troops
and
by
a
forced
march
through
the
wilderness
to
canada
to
subdue
and
exterminate
if
possible
a
large
number
of
indians
half
breeds
and
canadians
who
inhabited
a
few
villages
on
the
french
border
and
whose
marauding
exploits
and
horrible
daily
murders
of
their
english
and
provincial
captives
were
the
terror
of
the
whole
country
as
it
was
thought
not
unwisely
that
the
tenor
of
my
past
life
my
influence
with
the
indians
and
my
acquaintance
with
the
forest
had
peculiarly
fitted
me
for
such
an
expedition
i
received
a
letter
from
the
general
appointing
me
to
this
command
i
was
moreover
presented
with
a
colonel
s
commission
i
entered
upon
the
now
increasing
and
i
determined
to
prove
that
the
confidence
now
almost
for
the
first
time
reposed
in
me
had
not
been
displaced
finding
it
necessary
however
to
lead
a
detachment
of
my
troops
through
the
settled
part
of
massachusetts
i
was
enabled
in
the
dusk
of
evening
and
accompanied
by
two
faithful
indians
who
were
to
give
the
alarm
if
there
was
danger
of
discovery
for
you
may
judge
that
i
was
inexpressibly
anxious
that
this
nocturnal
adventure
should
not
be
publicly
known
to
make
a
visit
to
morton
s
hope
before
setting
out
upon
my
grand
and
dangerous
expedition
i
felt
irresistibly
impelled
once
more
to
embrace
my
child
while
i
was
reflecting
upon
this
subject
i
became
seized
with
the
frantic
determination
to
seize
you
at
once
and
carry
you
away
nothing
else
however
than
the
conviction
that
if
i
took
you
from
my
brother
without
his
consent
your
fate
would
be
irrecoverably
sealed
and
the
advantages
derived
from
his
adoption
entirely
forfeited
of
my
child
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
any
one
as
it
was
i
endeavoured
by
tears
and
the
most
frantic
supplications
which
paternal
love
and
agony
could
suggest
to
induce
my
brother
s
consent
to
your
absence
for
a
short
time
nothing
else
than
an
entire
renunciation
of
his
adopted
son
would
he
assured
been
time
to
sketch
the
curious
picture
which
the
contrast
produced
but
the
sun
was
fast
descending
and
they
turned
their
faces
towards
the
town
below
then
burst
upon
their
sight
one
of
the
richest
and
most
variegated
landscapes
it
had
ever
been
the
lot
of
either
to
witness
the
broad
plains
of
mascali
were
spread
out
like
a
map
beneath
them
fields
covered
with
dry
canes
of
a
light
yellow
hue
patches
of
green
grain
and
dark
masses
the
site
of
vineyards
or
arable
land
combined
to
form
a
parterre
which
as
the
setting
sun
fell
richly
over
it
had
all
the
effect
of
an
extensive
garden
beyond
was
away
to
the
left
taormina
hanging
as
it
were
on
a
bold
promontory
on
the
summit
of
which
are
the
remains
of
an
extensive
amphitheatre
and
nearer
around
the
slopes
and
valleys
the
lava
beds
and
trees
of
the
venerable
mountain
if
the
morning
s
prospect
inspired
something
of
awe
that
of
the
evening
only
excited
gladsome
sensations
it
spoke
of
plenty
of
fertility
of
a
bounteous
and
beautiful
country
how
unutterably
sad
said
vittorio
as
they
were
slowly
descending
that
so
fair
a
heritage
should
be
so
unhappily
peopled
that
superstition
and
ignorance
should
overshadow
so
rich
a
domain
and
that
where
we
rejoice
so
highly
in
the
exuberance
and
fine
array
of
nature
we
must
mourn
most
deeply
for
the
poverty
and
wretched
condition
of
humanity
one
would
think
replied
isabel
that
to
live
amid
such
influences
as
these
to
have
sweet
harmony
breathed
upon
the
soul
from
such
aspects
of
creation
day
by
day
and
year
by
agencies
at
work
upon
these
poor
people
could
not
supersede
government
is
more
of
a
reality
to
most
men
than
nature
drily
observed
her
uncle
happily
however
she
replied
nature
operates
silently
and
may
produce
effects
upon
character
of
which
the
casual
spectator
dreams
not
yes
added
the
count
and
it
is
a
happy
thought
that
many
a
noble
aspiration
or
grateful
sentiment
may
have
been
aroused
in
the
breast
of
the
poor
villager
as
he
descended
this
path
with
no
companion
but
his
mule
and
looked
forth
as
we
now
do
upon
the
luxuriant
earth
and
the
glad
sea
there
is
a
lesson
for
the
wisest
and
a
balm
for
the
most
stricken
in
this
landscape
for
some
moments
they
continued
the
descent
in
silence
till
an
exclamation
from
one
of
the
party
caused
them
to
look
back
from
the
white
and
lofty
cone
of
etna
a
dense
column
of
smoke
was
rising
majestically
to
the
line
and
then
gracefully
turning
floated
in
a
wide
and
saffron
coloured
streak
along
the
face
of
the
sky
this
is
all
you
wanted
to
complete
your
day
s
good
fortune
said
the
guide
it
is
not
for
every
stranger
that
the
mountain
will
smoke
they
continued
to
watch
this
interesting
phenomenon
long
after
their
return
to
giarra
and
when
night
had
overshadowed
the
scene
a
few
flashes
of
flame
from
the
awakened
crater
and
an
almost
constant
effusion
of
sparks
amply
repaid
them
for
their
vigil
the
next
day
proved
as
fine
as
the
preceding
and
to
obtain
a
more
pleasing
succession
of
prospects
it
was
determined
to
prosecute
the
remainder
of
their
journey
by
the
mule
path
as
the
distance
was
but
about
twenty
miles
it
was
not
deemed
desirable
to
depart
before
early
noon
isabel
devoted
the
intervening
time
to
repose
vittorio
went
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
and
frazier
repaired
to
the
adjoining
village
to
visit
a
wine
merchant
with
whom
he
had
been
acquainted
many
together
and
resumed
their
journey
they
found
themselves
for
some
time
upon
the
carriage
road
and
in
view
of
scenery
not
differing
essentially
from
that
of
the
preceding
day
occasionally
they
passed
large
flocks
of
goats
driven
by
boys
who
carried
the
young
kids
slung
upon
their
shoulders
or
a
company
of
peasants
each
with
his
donkey
bearing
in
long
narrow
barrels
hung
like
panniers
wine
from
the
hills
into
the
neighboring
town
my
friend
told
me
said
frazier
that
the
chief
employment
of
these
people
is
to
transport
the
wine
in
this
manner
it
is
taken
from
large
butts
such
as
we
saw
at
the
cottage
yesterday
each
of
those
little
casks
contains
about
eighteen
gallons
of
the
most
ordinary
wine
the
country
produces
it
is
chiefly
used
for
distillation
yielding
about
one
part
in
seven
of
pure
spirit
the
compensation
these
carriers
obtain
would
not
be
considered
in
america
as
equivalent
for
an
hour
s
work
but
in
time
of
vintage
their
pay
is
increased
and
after
support
life
no
said
vittorio
give
a
sicilian
peasant
a
little
fennel
or
roasted
pulse
a
small
dish
of
maccaroni
or
a
few
pounds
of
bread
with
a
mug
of
common
wine
and
he
fares
like
a
lord
but
seldom
acquires
the
strength
of
a
man
replied
frazier
for
notwithstanding
their
broad
chests
and
muscular
limbs
they
can
not
be
called
strong
at
least
in
proportion
to
appearances
you
have
told
us
nothing
uncle
said
isabel
of
your
visit
to
riposto
how
did
you
find
your
old
friend
i
found
him
sitting
on
an
old
sofa
in
a
bare
looking
room
stirring
the
coals
in
a
brazier
with
the
key
of
his
magazine
i
rallied
him
upon
his
taste
in
preferring
so
dreary
a
life
on
the
coast
of
sicily
to
the
comforts
of
old
england
but
he
declared
himself
well
satisfied
with
his
lot
there
he
was
surrounded
with
coopers
stills
and
a
set
of
half
civilised
sicilians
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
wine
merchant
on
the
coast
as
busy
and
happy
in
his
exile
as
many
who
had
never
been
away
from
the
light
of
their
own
firesides
such
is
the
force
of
habit
in
practical
application
in
forwarding
however
humbly
the
economy
of
life
almost
any
man
may
enjoy
a
contented
existence
a
contented
granted
uncle
said
isabel
but
not
necessarily
a
happy
or
an
improving
one
riposto
continued
frazier
fifty
anxious
circumstances
having
succeeded
thus
in
effecting
a
complete
revolution
as
to
the
different
grounds
occupied
by
himself
and
the
unfortunate
max
the
wily
lawyer
entered
more
boldly
into
his
subject
and
if
greyslaer
who
as
yet
had
hardly
surmised
the
drift
of
his
discourse
blushed
at
the
compliments
which
had
been
paid
to
his
understanding
he
now
reddened
with
indignation
as
the
cunning
tongue
of
detraction
became
busy
with
his
character
but
his
ire
instantly
gave
way
to
contempt
when
the
popular
pleader
came
to
a
part
of
his
speech
in
which
with
an
ill
judged
reliance
upon
the
sordid
prejudices
of
his
hearers
he
had
the
audacity
to
attempt
rousing
their
political
feelings
by
painting
the
young
soldier
as
by
birth
and
feeling
an
aristocrat
the
son
and
representative
of
a
courtier
colonel
who
in
his
lifetime
had
always
acted
with
the
patrician
party
in
the
colony
the
allusion
which
formed
the
climax
of
a
and
he
stretched
out
his
arm
as
if
about
to
interrupt
the
speaker
but
his
look
of
proud
resentment
changed
suddenly
into
one
of
utter
scorn
as
he
glanced
around
the
court
his
equanimity
at
once
returned
to
him
and
he
resumed
his
place
uttering
only
in
a
calm
voice
the
words
you
may
go
on
sir
the
shrewd
lawyer
became
fully
aware
of
his
mistake
from
the
suppressed
murmur
which
pervaded
the
room
before
he
could
resume
he
had
by
these
few
last
words
undone
all
that
he
had
previously
effected
he
had
caused
every
one
present
to
remember
who
and
what
the
prisoner
was
up
to
the
very
moment
when
he
stood
here
upon
trial
for
his
life
the
experienced
advocate
did
not
however
attempt
to
eat
his
words
or
flounder
back
to
the
safe
ground
he
had
so
incautiously
left
but
hurried
on
to
the
next
branch
of
the
subject
as
quickly
as
possible
and
now
came
the
most
torturing
moment
for
greyslear
the
speaker
dropped
whispering
as
if
he
feared
the
very
walls
might
echo
the
hideous
tale
he
had
to
tell
if
spoken
louder
thrilled
the
ears
of
all
present
with
the
relation
of
the
monstrous
loves
of
alida
and
isaac
brant
even
as
the
foul
lips
of
bradshawe
had
first
retailed
the
scandal
the
cold
drops
stood
upon
the
brow
of
greyslaer
and
as
the
low
impassioned
and
most
eloquent
tones
of
the
speaker
crept
into
his
ears
he
listened
shuddering
fain
would
he
have
shut
up
his
senses
against
the
sounds
that
were
distilled
like
blistering
dew
upon
them
but
his
faculty
of
hearing
seemed
at
once
sharpened
and
fixed
with
the
same
involuntary
intenseness
which
rivets
the
gaze
of
the
spellbound
bird
upon
its
serpent
charmer
and
when
the
speaker
again
paused
he
drew
the
long
breath
which
the
chest
of
the
dreamer
will
heave
when
some
horrid
fiction
of
the
night
uncoils
itself
from
his
labouring
fancy
the
advocate
ventured
then
to
return
once
more
to
the
character
of
the
prisoner
himself
ere
he
closed
this
most
unhappy
history
as
the
luckless
victim
of
an
artful
and
most
abandoned
woman
but
he
had
not
come
there
he
said
to
deplore
the
degradation
which
amid
the
unguarded
passions
of
youth
might
overtake
a
mind
of
virtue
s
richest
and
noblest
promise
the
public
weal
alas
imposed
upon
him
and
upon
the
intelligent
gentlemen
who
composed
the
jury
before
him
a
far
sterner
duty
a
duty
which
painful
as
it
was
must
still
be
rigidly
impartially
fulfilled
and
no
matter
what
accidents
of
fortune
may
have
surrounded
the
prisoner
no
matter
what
pleading
associations
connected
with
his
youth
and
his
name
might
interpose
themselves
no
matter
what
sorrowful
regrets
must
mingle
with
the
righteous
verdict
the
evidence
would
compel
them
to
give
in
they
were
answerable
alike
to
god
and
their
country
for
that
which
they
should
this
day
record
as
the
truth
the
testimony
as
we
have
already
detailed
it
was
then
entered
into
and
as
the
reader
is
in
possession
of
the
evidence
it
no
questions
to
put
in
cross
examination
of
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
and
this
part
of
the
proceedings
was
soon
disposed
of
the
impression
made
by
the
testimony
was
so
strong
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
scarcely
attempted
to
enforce
it
by
any
comments
and
now
the
prisoner
for
the
first
time
opened
his
lips
in
his
own
defence
i
come
not
here
said
greyslear
to
struggle
for
a
life
which
is
valueless
and
though
there
are
flaws
in
the
evidence
just
given
which
the
plain
story
i
might
tell
would
i
think
soon
make
apparent
to
all
who
hear
me
i
am
willing
to
abide
by
the
testimony
as
it
stands
i
mean
said
he
with
emphasis
the
testimony
immediately
relating
to
the
transaction
which
has
placed
me
where
i
am
but
regardless
as
i
may
be
of
the
issues
of
this
trial
as
regards
myself
there
is
another
implicated
in
its
results
whom
that
gentleman
i
thank
him
for
the
kindness
though
god
knows
the
opportunity
of
vindicating
before
the
community
where
she
has
been
so
cruelly
maligned
death
for
me
has
no
terrors
the
scaffold
no
shame
if
the
proceedings
by
which
i
perish
shall
providentially
in
their
progress
make
fully
clear
her
innocence
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
here
rose
and
suggested
that
the
unfortunate
prisoner
had
better
keep
to
the
matter
immediately
before
the
court
he
saw
no
necessity
for
making
a
double
issue
in
the
trial
c
c
the
spectators
who
were
already
impressed
by
the
few
words
which
greyslaer
had
uttered
murmured
audibly
at
the
interruption
but
max
only
noticed
the
rudeness
by
a
cold
bow
to
the
opposite
party
as
still
addressing
the
court
he
straightway
resumed
the
learned
advocate
who
has
given
such
signal
proofs
of
his
zeal
and
his
ability
in
this
day
s
trial
has
directed
his
chief
efforts
to
prove
a
sufficient
motive
for
the
commission
of
the
act
with
which
i
am
charged
in
the
attempt
to
of
the
sinner
you
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
your
presumption
by
your
life
you
would
hunt
the
bear
in
his
native
brake
beware
of
his
embrace
he
left
the
place
of
his
concealment
with
a
stealthy
step
and
without
disturbing
the
lovers
who
were
now
but
too
much
absorbed
with
one
another
to
have
senses
for
the
rustling
branches
or
the
slight
motion
of
a
gliding
form
among
the
leaves
he
proceeded
to
the
tavern
with
all
the
impatience
of
hate
and
summoned
his
confederates
who
played
the
part
of
the
officers
of
justice
to
them
he
issued
his
commands
and
described
the
place
in
which
the
lovers
were
still
to
be
found
seek
him
there
said
the
vindictive
outlaw
and
seize
on
him
at
once
give
him
no
indulgence
drag
him
away
though
you
find
him
in
her
arms
hear
none
of
his
scoundrel
is
a
spy
upon
us
another
hurdis
and
he
deserves
no
mercy
at
our
hands
away
you
know
the
place
he
saw
them
depart
in
the
same
instant
and
waited
with
malicious
impatience
the
result
of
his
previous
mandate
the
lovers
meanwhile
had
prepared
to
return
to
the
cottage
they
were
already
on
their
way
the
hand
of
the
maiden
in
that
of
vernon
s
her
eyes
cast
upon
the
ground
as
she
listened
to
those
accents
so
dear
to
the
young
heart
those
idle
words
and
whispers
which
though
they
sound
sillily
enough
in
the
ears
of
third
persons
seem
to
the
initiate
more
precious
than
manna
in
the
wilderness
at
this
moment
they
were
encountered
by
the
ruffians
who
stood
suddenly
in
the
path
before
them
virginia
shrunk
back
in
alarm
while
a
faint
scream
issued
from
her
lips
how
now
fellows
what
mean
you
demanded
vernon
who
did
not
at
first
recognise
them
fellows
indeed
said
fellow
when

sets
eyes
upon
us
that
s
for
being
civil
to

you
off
when
we
had
you
but
there
s
an
end
to
that
you
must
go
along
with
us
along
with
you

harry
vernon
that
killed
one
thomas
horsey
and
we
ai
nt
the
men
that
squire
nawls
sent
to
catch
you
come
come
young
un
that
s
not
doing
the
thing
handsomely
that
s
not
keeping
to
your
promise
you
must
go
along
with
us
at
once
so
drop
the
young
lady
s
arm
and
here
s
our
n
it
ai
nt
quite
so
soft
a
one
it
s
true
but
by
the
hokey
it
s
better
able
to
help
you
and
then
you
know
need
must
when
the
devil
drives
so
with
his
words
his
hand
was
already
extended
toward
the
collar
of
vernon
s
coat
when
stepping
back
a
pace
the
indignant
youth
lifted
his
staff
with
a
promptness
and
determination
which
drove
the
fellow
back
much
faster
than
he
had
advanced
in
another
instant
however
a
calmer
mood
filled
the
mind
of
vernon
this
is
all
idle
i
certainly
do
not
mean
to
resist
these
men
i
have
no
reason
to
fear
the
magistrate
such
were
his
thoughts
as
he
turned
to
virginia
miss
wilson
forgive
me
i
am
giving
you
a
needless
alarm
these
are
the
officers
of
justice
and
seeing
me
well
enough
to
travel
they
naturally
enough
seek
to
perform
their
duty
will
you
proceed
to
the
house
i
will
follow
you
i
would
speak
with
them
awhile
he
led
her
forward
until
they
had
passed
the
officers
then
left
her
to
proceed
alone
while
he
returned
to
them
gentlemen
i
will
be
ready
to
go
with
to
the
dwelling
of
mr
wilson
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
will
meet
you
at
the
tavern
twont
do
my
boy
was
the
answer
you
re
too
ready
with
your
stick
to
be
trusted
you
must
go
with
us
now
we
ca
nt
trust
you
out
of
our
sight
the
youth
would
have
expostulated
but
while
he
spoke
one
of
the
ruffians
threw
himself
upon
him
bore
him
to
the
earth
and
in
spite
of
all
his
assurances
that
he
would
quietly
accompany
them
proceeded
to
bind
his
arms
with
a
cord
which
the
providence
of
saxon
had
procured
for
the
purpose
and
which
the
assistance
of
his
companion
enabled
him
to
use
in
spite
of
the
angry
but
feeble
resistance
of
the
prisoner
when
bound
they
lifted
him
to
his
feet
and
placing
themselves
one
on
each
hand
commanded
him
to
move
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
tavern
he
did
so
with
as
much
quietness
of
temper
as
he
could
command
under
tried
to
convince
himself
that
they
were
doing
nothing
more
than
their
duty
that
they
had
yielded
him
all
reasonable
indulgence
and
were
bound
as
soon
as
they
discovered
his
ability
to
travel
to
secure
his
person
against
the
chances
of
escape
but
the
sedative
effect
of
his
own
reasonings
was
very
partial
he
still
could
not
resist
the
wish
that
his
arms
were
once
more
free
and
his
staff
once
more
in
his
hands
my
staff
should
make
ye
skip
thought
he
in
the
language
of
the
ancient
mariner
but
he
overcame
a
desire
which
he
felt
to
be
no
less
idle
than
hopeless
and
tried
to
obtain
his
remedy
in
another
way
a
civil
answer
turneth
away
wrath
and
he
had
long
known
that
a
civil
tongue
will
carry
a
man
unscotched
through
the
whole
western
country
assuming
the
men
beside
him
to
be
no
other
than
what
they
professed
to
be
he
determined
to
reason
with
them
as
persons
who
could
have
no
motive
for
refusing
the
security
of
their
trust
you
are
unnecessarily
hard
with
me
men
he
said
quietly
you
can
have
no
reason
for
thinking
i
would
run
away
since
if
such
had
been
my
desire
i
could
have
been
off
at
daylight
and
none
heartless
incendiary
with
his
demon
matches
and
burning
down
their
cottage
with
all
its
out
houses
in
such
cases
answered
the
lightning
maker
i
thinks
of
my
two
babies
at
home
with
their
poor
lame
mother
and
i
makes
it
a
point
if
my
feelings
is
very
much
wrought
up
as
the
prompter
says
to
run
home
between
the
acts
to
see
that
all
the
hearth
is
nt
that
the
thing
i
think
it
is
and
i
m
glad
to
hear
you
talk
so
feelingly
answered
puffer
hopkins
our
next
mayor
s
a
very
domestic
minded
man
just
such
a
man
as
you
are
only
i
do
nt
believe
he
d
be
so
prudent
and
active
about
the
bucket
on
the
hearth
at
this
the
lightning
maker
smiled
pleasantly
to
himself
and
unconsciously
thrust
a
large
roll
of
brimstone
in
his
cheek
is
this
your
natural
complexion
that
you
have
on
this
morning
resumed
puffer
hopkins
seeing
how
well
the
personal
compliment
took
and
glancing
at
the
lightning
maker
s
yellow
chaps
if
it
is
the
resemblance
between
yourself
and
the
gentleman
i
have
mentioned
is
more
striking
than
i
could
have
expected
his
nose
is
a
copper
is
nt
yours
inclining
a
little
that
way
i
believe
it
is
answered
the
journeyman
lightning
maker
complacently
your
eye
is
a
deep
grey
i
this
light
that
s
what
the
committee
of
nomination
when
they
waited
on
the
next
mayor
thought
was
his
in
the
flutter
of
nerves
created
by
the
scourer
s
instituting
these
pleasant
comparisons
the
lightning
maker
unadvisedly
brought
together
a
couple
of
hostile
combustibles
which
occasioned
the
premature
bursting
of
a
small
bottle
of
azure
lightning
without
scenery
to
match
and
a
small
sky
light
was
opened
thereby
through
a
decayed
shingle
in
the
roof
instructed
by
this
of
the
tropical
climate
of
the
lightning
maker
s
garret
and
thinking
that
a
sufficient
train
had
been
laid
for
a
future
vote
puffer
who
had
been
advised
of
the
residence
of
a
stout
cobbler
in
the
neighboring
attic
trotted
up
a
ladder
and
through
the
open
skuttle
and
scrambling
over
the
pitched
roof
plunged
down
a
similar
opening
in
the
next
house
and
came
very
suddenly
upon
the
object
he
sought
the
burly
shoe
maker
was
seated
on
a
cobbler
s
bench
working
away
merrily
enough
at
his
side
was
laid
a
long
by
him
a
bundle
of
chattels
corded
up
and
arranged
apparently
for
instant
transportation
how
is
this
cried
the
cobbler
as
his
eye
caught
the
person
of
puffer
hopkins
this
is
nt
fair
nor
is
it
legal
in
any
courts
whether
of
chancery
or
common
law
writs
do
nt
descend
sir
i
know
enough
for
that
no
deputy
sheriff
was
ever
enough
of
an
angel
to
come
from
above
i
resist
process
do
you
hear
that
saying
this
the
cobbler
started
up
and
seizing
his
bench
planted
it
on
end
in
front
of
the
corded
bale
of
chattels
and
standing
between
the
two
he
glared
fiercely
through
the
circular
broken
seat
of
the
bench
on
the
suspected
deputy
a
few
words
however
calmed
his
agitation
he
threw
down
his
bench
resumed
his
seat
and
in
token
of
his
perfect
satisfaction
and
pleasure
in
the
explanation
puffer
had
given
of
the
character
in
which
he
visited
him
long
hearty
puffs
growing
communicative
as
their
intercourse
continued
puffer
at
length
learned
that
the
gentleman
was
the
proprietor
of
the
dutch
oven
down
stairs
the
terror
of
mr
blinker
the
president
was
greatly
distressed
by
creditors
who
hunted
him
with
catchpoles
and
marshals
from
morning
till
night
that
all
his
proprietary
interest
on
the
lower
floors
lay
in
the
oven
aforesaid
and
a
very
comfortable
little
fat
wife
whose
pride
and
comfort
consisted
in
a
turkey
browned
before
a
slow
fire
and
other
little
necessaries
allowed
by
law
the
corded
bale
held
his
valuables
and
with
these
he
was
prepared
to
mount
at
a
moment
s
warning
through
the
scuttle
and
to
convey
himself
to
the
peak
of
the
house
where
he
made
it
a
point
to
sit
in
the
shadow
of
a
broad
chimney
and
smoke
his
pie
at
ease
until
the
cloud
of
pursuers
was
fairly
dispersed
or
blown
over
they
shall
never
catch
me
while
i
live
cried
the
roof
i
ll
climb
down
the
lightning
rod
with
that
bundle
on
my
back
i
can
do
it
and
if
one
of
the
rascals
attempts
to
climb
up
to
me
i
ll
drop
it
and
break
his
neck
off
short
depend
on
that
my
dear
fellow
i
d
be
at
the
expense
of
the
board
lodging
and
education
of
a
south
american
condor
and
teach
him
to
bear
it
off
in
his
beak
before
they
should
touch
a
thread
of
it
now
you
know
my
mind
at
this
he
struck
a
thick
heel
on
which
he
was
at
work
a
thumping
blow
with
his
hammer
and
kicked
his
lapstone
across
the
whole
breadth
of
the
garret
puffer
hopkins
of
course
applauded
the
spirit
of
the
cobbler
and
artlessly
suggested
that
no
man
with
the
soul
of
a
man
would
submit
quietly
to
such
impertinent
intermeddling
with
his
private
affairs
however
my
friend
he
continued
scouring
as
industriously
as
he
well
knew
how
these
gentlemen
of
the
law
may
yet
have
their
combs
cut
i
do
nt
think
they
will
always
be
allowed
to
crow
and
chanticleer
it
over
honest
men
why
not
asked
the
cobbler
looking
at
puffer
hopkins
anxiously
and
planting
his
great
hands
upon
his
knees
for
no
very
particular
reason
answered
the
scourer
except
that
i
have
heard
it
suggested
that
our
new
common
council
mind
i
say
our
new
common
council
will
abolish
the
office
of
sheriff
and
all
others
that
interfere
with
the
enjoyment
of
a
man
s
property
by
himself
they
ll
do
away
with
writs
and
executions
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
said
puffer
coolly
that
s
all
say
you
so
shouted
the
cobbler
springing
from
his
bench
than
the
province
house
can
now
afford
while
the
burthen
of
life
remains
upon
me
i
will
have
no
other
shelter
than
this
roof
persisted
esther
dudley
striking
her
staff
upon
the
floor
with
a
gesture
that
expressed
immovable
resolve
and
when
your
excellency
returns
in
triumph
i
will
totter
into
the
porch
to
welcome
you
my
poor
old
friend
answered
the
british
general
and
all
his
manly
and
martial
pride
could
no
longer
restrain
a
gush
of
bitter
tears
this
is
an
evil
hour
for
you
and
me
the
province
which
the
hence
in
misfortune
perchance
in
disgrace
to
return
no
more
and
you
whose
present
being
is
incorporated
with
the
past
who
have
seen
governor
after
governor
in
stately
pageantry
ascend
these
steps
whose
whole
life
has
been
an
observance
of
majestic
ceremonies
and
a
worship
of
the
king
how
will
you
endure
the
change
come
with
us
bid
farewell
to
a
land
that
has
shaken
off
its
allegiance
and
live
still
under
a
royal
government
at
halifax
never
never
said
the
pertinacious
old
dame
here
will
i
abide
and
king
george
shall
still
have
one
true
subject
in
his
disloyal
province
beshrew
the
old
fool
muttered
sir
william
howe
growing
impatient
of
her
obstinacy
and
ashamed
of
the
emotion
into
which
he
had
been
betrayed
she
is
the
very
moral
of
old
fashioned
prejudice
and
could
exist
nowhere
but
in
this
musty
edifice
well
then
mistress
dudley
since
you
will
needs
tarry
i
give
the
province
house
in
it
safe
until
myself
or
some
other
royal
governor
shall
demand
it
of
you
smiling
bitterly
at
himself
and
her
he
took
the
heavy
key
of
the
province
house
and
delivering
it
into
the
old
lady
s
hands
drew
his
cloak
around
him
for
departure
as
the
general
glanced
back
at
esther
dudley
s
antique
figure
he
deemed
her
well
fitted
for
such
a
charge
as
being
so
perfect
a
representative
of
the
decayed
past
of
an
age
gone
by
with
its
manners
opinions
faith
and
feelings
all
fallen
into
oblivion
or
scorn
of
what
had
once
been
a
reality
but
was
now
merely
a
vision
of
faded
magnificence
then
sir
william
howe
strode
forth
smiting
his
clenched
hands
together
in
the
fierce
anguish
of
his
spirit
and
old
esther
dudley
was
left
to
keep
watch
in
the
lonely
province
house
dwelling
there
with
memory
and
if
hope
ever
seemed
to
flit
around
her
still
it
was
memory
in
disguise
the
total
change
of
affairs
not
drive
the
venerable
lady
from
her
strong
hold
there
was
not
for
many
years
afterwards
a
governor
of
massachusetts
and
the
magistrates
who
had
charge
of
such
matters
saw
no
objection
to
esther
dudley
s
residence
in
the
province
house
especially
as
they
must
otherwise
have
paid
a
hireling
for
taking
care
of
the
premises
which
with
her
was
a
labor
of
love
and
so
they
left
her
the
undisturbed
mistress
of
the
old
historic
edifice
many
and
strange
were
the
fables
which
the
gossips
whispered
about
her
in
all
the
chimney
corners
of
the
town
among
the
time
worn
articles
of
furniture
that
had
been
left
in
the
mansion
there
was
a
tall
antique
mirror
which
was
well
worthy
of
a
tale
by
itself
and
perhaps
may
hereafter
be
the
theme
of
one
the
gold
of
its
heavily
wrought
frame
was
tarnished
and
its
surface
so
blurred
that
the
old
woman
s
figure
whenever
she
paused
before
it
looked
indistinct
and
ghostlike
but
it
was
the
general
belief
that
esther
could
beautiful
ladies
who
had
once
adorned
their
festivals
the
indian
chiefs
who
had
come
up
to
the
province
house
to
hold
council
or
swear
allegiance
the
grim
provincial
warriors
the
severe
clergymen
in
short
all
the
pageantry
of
gone
days
all
the
figures
that
ever
swept
across
the
broad
plate
of
glass
in
former
times
she
could
cause
the
whole
to
reappear
and
people
the
inner
world
of
the
mirror
with
shadows
of
old
life
such
legends
as
these
together
with
the
singularity
of
her
isolated
existence
her
age
and
the
infirmity
that
each
added
winter
flung
upon
her
made
mistress
dudley
the
object
both
of
fear
and
pity
and
it
was
partly
the
result
of
either
sentiment
that
amid
all
the
angry
license
of
the
times
neither
wrong
nor
insult
ever
fell
upon
her
unprotected
head
indeed
there
was
so
much
haughtiness
in
her
demeanor
towards
intruders
among
whom
she
reckoned
all
persons
acting
under
the
new
authorities
that
it
was
really
an
affair
of
no
small
nerve
to
people
justice
stern
republicans
as
they
had
now
become
they
were
well
content
that
the
old
gentlewoman
in
her
hoop
petticoat
and
faded
embroidery
should
still
haunt
the
palace
of
ruined
pride
and
overthrown
power
the
symbol
of
a
departed
system
embodying
a
history
in
her
person
so
esther
dudley
dwelt
year
after
year
in
the
province
house
still
reverencing
all
that
others
had
flung
aside
still
faithful
to
her
king
who
so
long
as
the
venerable
dame
yet
held
her
post
might
be
said
to
retain
one
true
subject
in
new
england
and
one
spot
of
the
empire
that
had
been
wrested
from
him
and
did
she
dwell
there
in
utter
loneliness
rumor
said
not
so
whenever
her
chill
and
withered
heart
desired
warmth
she
was
wont
to
summon
a
black
slave
of
governor
shirley
s
from
the
blurred
mirror
and
send
him
in
search
of
guests
who
had
long
ago
been
familiar
in
those
deserted
chambers
forth
went
the
sable
messenger
with
the
starlight
or
the
moonshine
burial
grounds
knocking
at
the
iron
doors
of
tombs
or
upon
the
marble
slabs
that
covered
them
and
whispering
to
those
within
my
mistress
old
esther
dudley
bids
you
to
the
province
house
at
midnight
and
punctually
as
the
clock
of
the
old
south
told
twelve
came
the
shadows
of
the
olivers
the
hutchinsons
the
dudleys
all
the
grandees
of
a
bygone
generation
gliding
beneath
the
portal
into
the
well
known
mansion
and
clinched
his
hands
but
his
prudence
did
not
forsake
him
i
tell
you
it
s
true
i
have
invested
it
in
half
a
dozen
small
ventures
i

got
but
fifty

i
believe
you
are
gumming
but

fifty
that

a

a
great
white
coat
dick
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
and
kept
his
way

he
found
that
the
stranger

dogged
him

lodgings

the

himself

a
chair

my

the
stranger
with
a
bland
smile
i

a
great
horror

all
about

scrape
when
he
was
half
drunk
says
i
this
is
a
fellow
of
the
right
mettle
and
i
resolved
to
see
you

a
scheme

want
a
fellow
of
your
spunk
as
for
that
fellow
johnson

for
i
reckon
he
tried
to
milk
you
d
n
him
said
dick
and
for
he
felt
himself
in
the
power
of
the
stranger
and
resolved
to
trust
him
though
he
plotted
in
his
heart
revenge
and
you
are
going
to
pay
him
the
hush
money
eh

secret

fifty

he

in
his
possession
a
hundred
or
two
of
the
bogus
but
his
d
d
honest
scruples
that
he
has
picked
up
will
make
him
destroy
them
he
has
not
yet
done
so
i
know

my
boy

cried
stimson
rubbing
his
hands
and
good
humoredly
punching
his
comrade

dick
but
wo
nt
he
peach
and
how
shall
you
escape
ho
ho
i
shall
make
myself
scarce
now
will
you
come
into
my
scheme
what
is
it
the
particulars
are
in
this
paper
said
the
stranger
taking
a
packet
from
his
bosom
read
them
and
i
will
see
you
at
this
hour
to
morrow
night
pay
johnson
two
hours
from
the
time
he
receives
your
fifty
he
s
jugged
all
night
my
boy
for
a
few
minutes
after
stimson
had
left
richard
martin
remained
in
deep
thought
then
seizing
the
paper
which
the
stranger
had
given
him
he
hurriedly
perused
its
contents
it
was
the
plan
of
a
contemplated
mutiny
on
board
the
ship
halcion
in
which
stimson
and
three
others
had
engaged
passages
four
others
also
were
in
the
plot
who
had
shipped
as
seamen
in
the
same
vessel
the
paper
went
on
to
to
run
for
the
floridas
and
then
take
on
board
twelve
more
who
were
sworn
to
the
business
a
well
concerted
plan
truly
thought
the
young
clerk
but
if
the
fool
thinks
i
ll
play
second
fiddle
he
s
mistaken
that
s
all
but
hang
it
ca
nt
i
turn
this
to
my
advantage
this
paper
but
no
blast
it
he
ll
blab
my
secret
if
i
try
to
injure
him
i
m
in
a
h
l
of
a
hobble
but
i
reckon
i
ll
sleep
on
it
so
saying
the
nice
young
man
adjourned
to
the
land
of
nod
after
fred
johnson
left
dick
he
that
he
would
either
lessen
the
number
of
yards
or
miscalculate
the
sum
in
his
own
favour
nor
was
his
confidence
abused
for
johnson
was
an
honest
man
and
had
only
used
indirection
to
come
at
the
true
price
because
of
sam
s
perverse
sagacity
in
bargains
i
did
but
buying
a
sheet
of
foolscap
i
retired
to
a
back
room
where
i
answered
clarence
s
letter
so
unexpectedly
rescued
from
the
dead
giving
him
among
other
matters
a
condensed
statement
of
its
resuscitation
it
was
a
full
hour
before
sam
s
return
and
then
the
quantum
suff
of
tea
coffee
glass
c
c
being
furnished
the
balance
of
trade
was
found
against
him
and
he
owed
the
store
precisely
nine
and
a
quarter
cents
in
lieu
of
this
mr
j
offered
to
take
one
of
sam
s
silver
fips
which
although
a
liberal
discount
in
sam
s
favour
he
regarded
as
right
down
jewish
usury
and
the
storekeeper
was
obliged
to
book
the
nine
and
a
quarter
cents
to
be
paid
in
sang
nor
was
this
conduct
of
sam
s
so
very
surprising
when
it
is
recollected
that
for
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
cents
could
then
be
bought
a
whole
acre
of
land
bottom
land
trees
spice
bush
papaws
and
all
hence
to
ask
pretty
good
slice
off
an
acre
sam
was
therefore
really
indignant
he
now
was
getting
ready
to
start
home
when
spying
a
spring
of
button
moles
he
remembered
he
was
to
buy
a
fip
sworth
and
supposing
a
prime
bargain
was
to
be
had
for
cash
he
proposed
to
pay
right
down
one
of
his
silver
pieces
for
the
half
of
the
string
worth
in
all
twenty
five
cents
come
now
said
he
mr
johnson
here
s
the
silver
cash
money
right
slam
smack
down
for
one
half
jist
of
that
ere
leetle
bit
of
a
string
oh
no
sam
we
ca
nt
go
that
i
ll
give
you
so
far
replied
johnson
measuring
a
minor
third
well
i
ve
traded
a
most
powerful
piece
of
linin
here
this
mornin
and
i
ll
be
teetotally
darned
if
i
wo
nt
try
josey
and
see
if
he
wo
nt
give
me
more
moles
for
silver
cash
money
our
storekeeper
a
feint
to
retain
a
customer
he
let
him
go
but
no
sooner
had
he
got
out
of
hearing
than
our
merchant
took
down
his
string
of
moles
and
laughing
as
he
slipped
off
nearly
half
into
a
drawer
he
said
to
me
sam
will
be
back
directly
and
then
i
mean
to
sell
him
a
little
more
than
the
worth
of
his
fip
he
then
suspended
the
diminished
string
in
its
former
place
and
shortly
after
sam
came
back
and
began
well
i
do
nt
like
after
all
to
d
sart
old
friends
and
so
says
i
jist
gim
me
one
half
of
that
darn
d
leetle
string
for
it
s
time
me
and
mr
carltin
was
makin
tracks
home
ah
sam
how
shall
we
live
these
hard
times
but
i
suppose
if
i
must
i
must
so
down
with
your
dust
and
here
s
a
full
half
and
now
take
which
end
you
like
sam
chose
to
a
good
eight
cents
worth
while
our
man
of
cash
pulled
out
a
small
dirty
deer
skin
pouch
and
untying
its
mouth
he
emptied
all
the
contents
on
the
counter
viz
two
silver
fips
three
chaw
d
bullits
a
damaged
rifle
wiper
four
inches
of
pigtail
tobacco
and
three
worn
gunflints
but
he
was
evidently
even
yet
scarcely
determined
to
part
with
his
cash
for
he
took
up
first
one
and
then
the
other
fip
apparently
more
than
once
about
to
return
both
to
the
pouch
and
offer
more
sang
till
at
length
believing
he
had
got
nearly
double
as
many
moles
as
he
could
obtain
for
trade
he
handed
over
with
the
air
of
one
making
another
s
fortune
the
worse
looking
and
more
worn
fippenny
bit
and
then
the
other
articles
together
with
the
button
moles
being
put
into
the
pouch
along
with
the
widowed
fip
he
was
ready
to
ride
and
we
in
a
few
moments
more
were
glee
at
the
way
in
which
he
had
made
it
off
o
johnson
i
e
the
way
he
had
just
got
the
worth
of
his
money
and
which
the
storekeeper
would
have
readily
given
him
at
once
without
so
much
plague
to
his
customer
s
wits
if
sam
s
own
dexterity
had
not
seemed
to
make
the
indirection
necessary
i
too
was
in
high
glee
hoping
to
secure
an
additional
vote
for
our
candidate
and
we
therefore
jogged
along
very
harmoniously
nay
as
it
was
now
becoming
dark
i
yielded
to
a
proposal
for
the
sake
of
company
to
go
all
the
way
round
by
the
indian
grave
that
being
the
proper
path
to
sam
s
settlement
this
reminds
me
of
my
promised
tale
of
the
indian
grave
to
which
after
ending
the
present
chapter
with
a
pleasant
little
adventure
of
our
own
this
night
the
next
chapter
will
be
devoted
not
long
after
our
quitting
the
three
blazes
and
turning
into
the
unblazed
trace
at
the
grave
to
ride
in
indian
file
dick
and
myself
in
the
van
sam
and
his
quadruped
in
the
rear
be
it
remembered
part
of
his
purchase
was
or
were
four
small
panes
of
glass
intended
to
illuminate
their
new
cabin
and
make
its
native
darkness
visible
in
the
day
a
sort
of
window
had
indeed
been
made
by
skipping
a
log
in
the
erection
but
our
friends
had
begun
to
be
richer
and
it
had
been
lately
voted
to
have
a
sash
of
four
lights
at
ten
cents
each
it
being
most
specially
for
this
the
twelve
yards
of
tow
cloth
had
been
woven
and
this
very
day
sold
at
spiceburgh
and
even
now
sam
the
eldest
son
twenty
one
years
old
last
spring
was
actually
riding
homeward
with
the
long
coveted
glass
done
up
in
two
sheets
of
led
to
rock
hall
paul
walked
a
long
distance
before
he
was
able
to
collect
his
thoughts
from
the
tumult
into
which
duncan
s
words
had
thrown
them
he
thought
he
now
had
the
key
to
her
rejection
of
his
passion
yes
he
said
sternly
she
has
hopes
of
entangling
the
rich
heir
of
kirkwood
and
so
scorns
me
and
her
duplicity
that
she
should
have
so
artfully
deceived
me
and
kept
the
secret
of
having
seen
powell
i
have
been
the
dupe
of
my
own
blind
passion
she
has
i
could
despise
myself
for
my
folly
i
will
forget
her
let
duncan
powell
win
and
wed
her
if
he
will
she
is
henceforth
nothing
to
me
with
this
determination
in
his
mind
the
young
man
strode
forward
at
a
more
rapid
pace
as
if
he
would
speedily
remove
himself
far
from
the
scene
of
his
defeat
yet
there
lingered
in
his
heart
with
his
contempt
and
anger
towards
her
the
germ
of
his
youthful
love
which
had
not
been
destroyed
but
only
trampled
upon
nevertheless
the
young
girl
he
so
severely
condemned
was
not
insensible
to
his
attachment
and
bitterly
wept
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
after
their
parting
alas
alas
she
said
in
a
voice
of
deep
suppressed
agony
as
she
sat
by
her
window
which
overlooked
the
hudson
bitter
is
my
lot
i
do
indeed
love
him
love
him
with
all
the
passion
of
my
woman
s
soul
but
his
love
were
a
curse
to
him
should
i
return
it
noble
heart
he
is
gone
believing
i
despise
him
it
is
best
it
should
be
so
oh
did
he
boy
as
he
is
but
know
my
heart
s
deep
feelings
oh
that
it
had
been
ice
ere
i
had
suffered
love
to
melt
it
with
tenderness
and
must
it
ever
be
thus
am
i
justified
in
thus
sacrificing
myself
to
a
power
i
detest
in
that
it
hath
brought
upon
me
this
misery
to
a
destiny
i
shrink
from
with
horror
my
poor
breaking
heart
what
with
my
father
s
woes
and
those
love
hath
now
brought
on
me
i
am
truly
wretched
oh
that
i
had
never
known
the
fearful
secret
that
bids
me
crush
my
heart
within
my
bosom
and
makes
love
a
curse
the
morning
found
her
early
in
her
father
s
presence
he
was
seated
in
an
old
arm
chair
with
his
head
leaning
upon
his
hand
a
folio
volume
of
the
prayers
of
the
romish
church
before
him
he
looked
up
his
hand
she
took
it
and
kissing
his
forehead
sat
by
him
he
was
a
tall
slender
man
with
exceedingly
dark
but
noble
features
and
had
that
indefinable
aristocratic
outline
which
is
supposed
to
be
peculiar
to
men
of
high
birth
his
face
was
handsome
but
wore
a
look
of
settled
melancholy
his
eyes
were
black
and
flashing
and
singularly
piercing
his
dress
was
dark
and
plain
the
only
ornament
he
displayed
about
his
person
being
a
seal
ring
of
great
size
and
beauty
you
have
not
slept
child
he
said
in
a
voice
rich
yet
low
in
its
tones
and
speaking
in
a
foreign
tongue
i
am
not
well
nay
i
will
speak
truly
i
am
unhappy
father
she
answered
in
the
same
language
life
is
wretched
with
the
price
i
pay
for
it
life
is
cheap
at
the
soul
s
price
he
said
in
a
voice
of
startling
energy
and
depth
nay
i
think
it
of
outgoings
of
the
heart
s
affections
ha
you
love
this
youth
he
said
in
a
voice
of
sudden
furiness
beware
he
is
worthy
he
saved
my
life
and
you
would
give
your
soul
in
exchange
for
it
yet
one
life
is
precious
god
knows
here
he
groaned
and
for
a
moment
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
will
you
never
forget
that
crime
dear
father
she
said
soothingly
there
is
forgiveness
on
repentance
and
surely
your
penitence
has
been
for
years
a
most
bitter
one
tears
can
never
wash
out
blood
nor
sighs
bring
back
the
breath
of
life
else
thy
mother
had
been
living
my
mother
was
it
my
mother
whose
murder
has
thus
driven
thee
from
clime
to
clime
as
if
fleeing
from
thy
own
conscience
she
cried
starting
up
and
gazing
upon
him
with
a
look
of
horror
i
knew
a
dark
crime
of
murder
lay
upon
thy
soul
and
human
life
in
its
extremest
peril
it
would
atone
for
that
thou
hadst
taken
away
but
my
mother
father
speak
fell
she
by
thy
hand
were
those
lovely
features
which
i
saw
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
a
death
by
poison
torn
thus
by
thy
murderous
act
nay
then
i
cease
to
pity
and
do
scorn
thee
i
knew
she
was
a
gypsy
for
thou
hast
told
me
i
knew
she
was
not
thy
wedded
wife
for
my
brain
yet
is
unsteady
with
the
accursed
narrative
of
my
mother
s
wrongs
i
knew
all
this
and
i
forgave
you
forgave
you
freely
for
how
could
a
child
withstand
a
father
kneeling
at
her
feet
for
pardon
but
i
knew
not
till
now
that
beside
the
crimes
thou
wert
guilty
of
towards
my
mother
and
inflicted
on
me
the
child
of
shame
thy
crime
of
blood
had
her
for
its
victim
i
was
accursed
in
being
a
gypsy
s
and
an
unwedded
mother
s
daughter
accursed
enough
in
wed
with
a
christian
accursed
in
being
the
child
of
a
murderer
brooding
daily
over
his
crime
but
all
this
is
light
compared
with
what
i
now
endure
in
the
knowledge
that
my
fair
mother
father
the
tie
that
bound
us
is
sundered
forever
the
guilty
man
listened
to
her
in
silence
and
with
a
look
of
agony
and
remorse
stamped
upon
his
dark
features
my
child
he
at
length
cried
taking
her
hand
as
she
was
turning
to
leave
the
chamber
listen
to
me
and
then
judge
me
i
am
of
the
noblest
blood
of
portugal
but
my
mother
being
a
piercing
cry
he
uttered
summoned
back
for
a
moment
the
reason
of
the
desolated
woman
before
him
but
the
gleam
of
mind
was
instantly
lost
in
a
darker
eclipse
than
that
from
which
the
voice
of
her
lover
had
evoked
it
she
gave
him
a
look
of
anguish
more
piteous
even
than
the
ravings
of
her
previous
distraction
and
then
while
her
lips
seemed
convulsed
with
the
effort
she
shrieked
forth
the
name
of
the
spaniard
in
the
same
instant
that
a
knife
which
she
clutched
from
her
husband
s
belt
laid
her
a
gory
corpse
at
his
feet
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
emotions
of
ta
in
ga
ro
at
the
spectacle
which
had
just
passed
like
some
dreadful
vision
before
his
eyes
the
very
soul
within
him
seemed
blasted
with
horror
and
dismay
at
the
frightful
desolation
that
had
overtaken
his
happy
home
the
casket
in
which
he
had
garnered
up
his
hopes
the
being
in
ruin
a
desecrated
corpse
before
him
and
he
that
had
wrought
this
stupendous
injury
he
the
author
of
this
fiendish
destruction
was
the
trusted
friend
of
his
bosom
the
appointed
guardian
and
protector
of
all
it
prized
on
earth
or
in
heaven
the
lapse
of
hours
found
the
wretched
husband
still
standing
in
mute
stupefaction
where
the
knowledge
of
his
calamity
had
first
burst
upon
his
agonized
senses
but
some
new
feeling
seemed
now
to
be
at
work
within
him
a
wild
and
sudden
impulse
gleamed
fearfully
over
his
fixed
and
haggard
countenance
he
became
an
altered
being
changed
on
the
instant
changed
in
heart
soul
and
character
as
if
the
spell
of
an
enchanter
had
passed
through
his
brain
till
now
he
had
been
either
more
or
less
than
an
indian
the
plastic
hand
of
love
had
moulded
him
into
a
different
creature
from
the
stern
and
immoveable
children
of
his
race
the
outlawed
warrior
had
loved
zecana
he
had
loved
her
not
as
the
sons
of
pleasure
by
the
luxuries
and
fettered
by
the
interests
the
prejudices
the
soul
shackling
bonds
of
civilization
not
as
the
artificial
creature
of
society
can
only
love
he
loved
with
a
soul
that
knew
no
dividing
cares
that
was
filled
with
no
hollow
dreams
of
pomp
and
power
he
loved
with
a
heart
that
was
tenanted
by
one
only
passion
he
worshipped
her
with
a
mind
that
bowed
to
no
image
beneath
the
sun
save
that
which
was
graven
on
his
own
bosom
nor
was
zecana
unworthy
such
a
passion
gentle
as
the
antelope
that
skimmed
the
green
savannas
near
she
was
still
a
being
fond
warm
and
doting
and
the
deepest
passions
of
her
woman
s
nature
had
been
called
into
action
by
the
wild
devotion
of
her
lover
the
flower
of
her
young
affections
had
budded
and
matured
to
life
like
the
quickly
blowing
blossoms
of
an
arctic
spring
while
the
fruits
it
bore
were
rich
and
full
and
glowing
as
those
which
a
tropic
summer
warms
into
existence
the
fulness
of
their
love
think
not
that
the
ties
of
association
were
wanting
to
knit
the
memory
of
every
look
and
word
of
hers
to
the
heart
strings
of
ta
in
ga
ro
the
radiant
face
of
nature
speaks
ever
to
the
indian
of
the
being
that
on
earth
he
most
adores
her
sigh
will
whisper
from
the
leafy
forest
her
smile
will
brighten
on
the
blossom
tufted
prairie
the
voice
that
murmurs
in
the
running
stream
syllables
her
name
in
tuneful
eloquence
for
ever
and
they
were
happy
the
brook
that
sang
beneath
the
willows
near
their
lodge
the
flowers
that
kissed
its
current
the
bird
that
warbled
on
the
spray
above
them
were
all
the
world
to
them
those
lonely
lovers
and
now
this
bower
of
bliss
was
blasted
this
home
of
peace
and
simple
joys
was
desolated
ruined
and
desecrated
as
if
the
malice
breathing
fiat
of
some
unhallowed
and
fabled
monster
had
gone
forth
against
the
happiness
of
its
owner
the
pulse
of
no
living
being
beat
with
sympathy
for
the
master
of
that
lonely
wreck
the
indomitable
pride
of
an
indian
chief
filled
its
inmost
recesses
with
new
resources
for
battling
with
his
fate
love
and
sorrow
like
the
snow
drift
which
smooths
the
rocky
casing
of
a
volcano
melted
in
a
moment
before
the
fires
that
glowed
within
his
flinty
bosom
and
his
original
nature
asserted
itself
in
every
fibre
of
his
frame
his
mien
and
his
heart
alike
were
altered
his
features
petrified
into
the
immobility
of
a
savage
while
his
brain
burned
with
a
thirst
for
vengeance
which
only
gave
no
outward
token
because
its
fiendish
cravings
were
unutterable
through
any
human
organ
calmly
now
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
ruffle
the
wonted
placidity
of
his
disposition
ta
in
ga
ro
proceeded
to
occupy
himself
for
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
few
concerns
that
required
his
attention
the
still
warm
body
of
zecana
after
being
carefully
wrapped
in
a
buffalo
skin
was
disposed
of
for
the
time
in
the
sunjiwun
or
cach
wherein
his
few
valuables
were
usually
kept
then
carefully
adjusting
everything
to
of
his
favourite
horse
which
after
the
late
arduous
journey
required
both
attention
and
refreshment
when
these
necessary
duties
were
fulfilled
the
solitary
at
the
approach
of
evening
tranquilly
lighted
his
pipe
and
passing
several
hours
under
its
soothing
influence
with
as
much
equanimity
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
interrupt
his
customary
enjoyment
he
at
last
wrapped
himself
in
his
wolf
skin
robe
and
was
soon
sleeping
as
soundly
as
if
a
dream
of
human
ill
had
never
thrown
a
shadow
over
his
slumbers
it
was
two
nights
after
this
that
the
spanish
trader
lay
securely
asleep
within
the
guarded
walls
of
his
station
his
repose
was
apparently
as
unmolested
as
that
which
has
just
been
ascribed
to
ta
in
ga
ro
and
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
sat
the
dusky
form
of
the
indian
warrior
watching
the
sleep
of
his
enemy
with
symbolical
of
the
dignity
of
the
colonial
agent
and
postmaster
general
of
america
than
of
the
humble
origin
of
the
newburyport
printer
the
writing
is
in
the
free
quick
style
of
a
man
with
great
practice
of
the
pen
and
is
particularly
agreeable
to
the
reader
another
letter
from
the
same
famous
hand
is
addressed
to
general
palmer
and
dated
passy
october
by
an
indorsement
on
the
outside
it
appears
to
have
been
transmitted
to
the
united
states
through
the
medium
of
lafayette
franklin
was
now
the
ambassador
of
his
country
at
the
court
of
versailles
enjoying
an
immense
alike
by
the
fashionable
and
the
learned
who
saw
something
sublime
and
philosophic
even
in
his
blue
yarn
stockings
still
as
before
he
writes
with
the
homeliness
and
simplicity
that
cause
a
human
face
to
look
forth
from
the
old
yellow
sheet
of
paper
and
in
words
that
make
our
ears
re
echo
as
with
the
sound
of
his
long
extinct
utterance
yet
this
brief
epistle
like
the
former
has
so
little
of
tangible
matter
that
we
are
ashamed
to
copy
it
next
we
come
to
the
fragment
of
a
letter
by
samuel
adams
an
autograph
more
utterly
devoid
of
ornament
or
flourish
than
any
other
in
the
collection
it
would
not
have
been
characteristic
had
his
pen
traced
so
much
as
a
hair
line
in
tribute
to
grace
beauty
or
the
elaborateness
of
manner
for
this
earnest
hearted
man
had
been
produced
out
of
the
past
elements
of
his
native
land
a
real
puritan
with
the
religion
of
his
forefathers
and
likewise
with
their
principles
of
government
taking
the
aspect
of
revolutionary
much
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
as
he
was
a
new
englander
and
a
son
of
the
old
bay
province
the
following
passage
has
much
of
the
man
in
it
i
heartily
congratulate
you
he
writes
from
philadelphia
after
the
british
have
left
boston
upon
the
sudden
and
important
change
in
our
affairs
in
the
removal
of
the
barbarians
from
the
capital
we
owe
our
grateful
acknowledgments
to
him
who
is
as
he
is
frequently
styled
in
sacred
writ
the
lord
of
hosts
we
have
not
yet
been
informed
with
certainty
what
course
the
enemy
have
steered
i
hope
we
shall
be
on
our
guard
against
future
attempts
will
not
care
be
taken
to
fortify
the
harbor
and
thereby
prevent
the
entrance
of
ships
of
war
hereafter
from
hancock
we
have
only
the
envelope
of
a
document
on
public
service
directed
to
the
hon
the
assembly
or
council
of
safety
of
new
hampshire
and
with
the
autograph
affixed
that
stands
seen
in
the
engraving
of
that
instrument
the
signature
looks
precisely
what
we
should
expect
and
desire
in
the
handwriting
of
a
princely
merchant
whose
penmanship
had
been
practised
in
the
ledger
which
he
is
represented
as
holding
in
copley
s
brilliant
picture
but
to
whom
his
native
ability
and
the
circumstances
and
customs
of
his
country
had
given
a
place
among
its
rulers
but
on
the
coarse
and
dingy
paper
before
us
the
effect
is
very
much
inferior
the
direction
all
except
the
signature
is
a
scrawl
large
and
heavy
but
not
forcible
and
even
the
name
itself
while
almost
identical
in
its
strokes
with
that
of
the
declaration
has
a
strangely
different
and
more
vulgar
aspect
perhaps
it
is
all
right
and
typical
of
the
truth
if
we
may
trust
tradition
and
unpublished
letters
and
a
few
witnesses
in
print
there
was
quite
as
much
difference
between
the
actual
man
and
his
historical
aspect
as
between
the
manuscript
signature
and
the
engraved
one
permanent
renown
is
said
to
have
characterized
him
as
a
man
without
a
head
or
heart
we
of
an
after
generation
should
hardly
be
entitled
on
whatever
evidence
to
assume
such
ungracious
liberty
with
a
name
that
has
occupied
a
lofty
position
until
it
has
grown
almost
sacred
and
which
is
associated
with
memories
more
sacred
than
itself
and
has
thus
become
a
valuable
reality
to
our
countrymen
by
the
aged
reverence
that
clusters
round
about
it
nevertheless
it
may
be
no
impiety
to
regard
hancock
not
precisely
as
a
real
personage
but
as
a
majestic
figure
useful
and
necessary
in
its
way
but
producing
its
effect
far
more
by
an
ornamental
outside
than
by
any
intrinsic
force
or
virtue
the
page
of
all
history
would
be
half
unpeopled
if
all
such
characters
were
banished
from
it
from
general
warren
we
have
a
letter
dated
january
only
a
few
months
before
he
attested
the
sincerity
of
his
patriotism
in
his
own
blood
on
bunker
hill
d
s
spout
upward
in
parabolic
curves
and
descend
at
a
considerable
distance
his
pen
seems
to
have
had
nothing
but
hair
lines
in
it
and
the
whole
letter
though
perfectly
legible
has
a
look
of
thin
and
unpleasant
irregularity
the
subject
is
a
plan
for
securing
to
the
colonial
party
the
services
of
colonel
gridley
the
engineer
by
an
appeal
to
his
private
interests
though
writing
to
general
palmer
an
intimate
friend
warren
signs
himself
most
ceremoniously
your
obedient
servant
indeed
these
stately
formulas
in
winding
up
a
letter
were
scarcely
laid
aside
whatever
might
be
the
familiarity
of
intercourse
husband
and
wife
were
occasionally
on
paper
at
least
the
obedient
servants
of
one
another
and
not
improbably
among
well
bred
people
there
was
a
corresponding
ceremonial
of
bows
and
courtesies
even
in
the
deepest
interior
of
domestic
life
with
all
the
reality
that
filled
men
s
hearts
and
which
has
stamped
its
impress
on
so
many
of
these
letters
it
was
a
be
remarked
that
warren
was
almost
the
only
man
eminently
distinguished
in
the
intellectual
phase
of
the
revolution
previous
to
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
who
actually
uplifted
his
arm
to
do
battle
the
legislative
patriots
were
a
distinct
class
from
the
patriots
of
the
camp
and
never
laid
aside
the
gown
for
the
sword
it
was
very
different
in
the
great
civil
war
of
england
where
the
leading
minds
of
the
burning
his
heart
s
core
turning
the
healthful
currents
of
his
bloed
to
streams
of
fiery
lava
the
deadest
hour
of
night
had
long
been
passed
already
when
he
dashed
forth
upon
that
desperate
race
the
pale
cold
light
of
morning
was
streaming
broad
but
still
over
the
palisaded
ditch
and
ramparts
of
the
spanish
fortress
when
don
hernando
de
leon
pulled
up
his
foaming
steed
before
the
drawbridge
early
however
and
untimely
as
was
the
hour
men
were
abroad
already
a
mounted
servitor
in
and
leading
by
the
bridle
rein
a
tall
bay
charger
trapped
and
housed
richly
with
the
same
colors
was
retiring
from
the
gates
which
were
just
closing
toward
the
barrack
stables
toward
this
steed
jaded
and
spent
with
toil
and
all
embossed
with
sweat
and
foam
flakes
and
galled
and
bleeds
ing
at
the
flanks
from
cruel
and
incessant
spurring
the
savage
blood
hounds
still
in
full
cry
dashed
without
check
or
stint
and
would
have
pulled
the
bay
horse
down
had
not
the
stern
voice
of
their
master
checked
them
he
rode
up
to
the
groom
and
in
a
deep
voice
calm
slow
and
perfectly
unmoved
demanded
whose
charger
without
reply
the
serxitor
was
hastening
away
when
he
asked
once
again
in
fiercer
tones
drawing
his
dagger
as
he
spoke
whose
charger
dog
speak
or
thou
diest
whose
charger
and
who
hath
now
dismounted
from
him
not
that
i
need
thy
voice
to
tell
me
what
i
already
know
but
words
whose
charger
don
guzman
de
herreiro
s
replied
the
faltering
menial
he
hath
even
now
gone
in
the
bridge
is
not
yet
lifted
excellent
well
replied
the
cavalier
excellent
well
mine
ancient
comrade
excellent
well
my
fellow
soldier
whose
life
i
have
thrice
saved
once
from
the
moors
amid
the
mountain
glens
of
malaga
once
from
the
surf
among
the
dread
antilles
and
once
here
in
this
isle
of
hispaniola
from
the
envenomed
arrow
of
the
charib
excellent
well
don
guzman
in
the
mean
time
dismounting
at
the
gates
he
gave
his
charger
and
his
hounds
to
the
care
of
a
faeorite
domestic
who
awaited
him
and
with
a
firm
slow
step
crossing
the
drawbridge
stopped
for
a
moment
to
address
the
sentinel
so
he
said
old
gaspar
thou
keepest
good
watch
when
went
don
guzman
forth
after
we
set
the
watch
yestreen
fair
he
spoke
his
partizan
now
i
bethink
me
it
was
scarce
five
minutes
after
thou
didst
ride
forth
into
the
forest
and
he
hath
now
returned
but
now
no
farther
words
were
interchanged
the
young
knight
slowly
passed
across
the
court
yard
entered
the
vaulted
passage
which
led
toward
the
chambers
of
don
guzman
paused
at
the
door
and
without
one
word
struck
on
the
panel
one
strong
blow
a
stern
voice
from
within
cried
enter
and
he
did
enter
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
locked
and
double
locked
it
and
though
strange
sounds
were
heard
and
fearful
voices
above
half
an
hour
passed
ere
he
came
forth
and
when
he
did
so
his
face
though
very
stern
and
calm
was
pale
as
death
and
he
retired
to
his
own
quarters
without
a
word
to
any
one
chapter
vi
it
was
not
until
a
late
hour
on
the
night
following
that
of
hernando
s
departure
from
the
presence
at
what
she
never
doubted
to
be
an
attempt
on
herreiro
s
part
to
execute
his
deadly
meaace
than
she
had
been
at
his
outrage
toward
herself
that
orozimbo
returned
from
caonaho
s
council
heated
and
out
of
breath
as
if
he
had
run
hard
and
somewhat
fatigued
but
with
an
air
of
high
enthusiasm
and
excitement
such
as
before
she
had
never
seen
in
her
brother
s
features
so
much
however
was
she
engrossed
with
the
thoughts
of
what
had
the
previous
night
befallen
her
proving
as
it
did
beyond
a
doubt
the
implacable
and
fiendish
malice
of
don
guzman
and
filling
her
with
the
wildest
apprehensions
for
her
beloved
hernando
s
safety
that
she
paid
far
less
attention
to
the
manner
or
appearance
ol
her
brother
than
under
any
other
circumstances
she
would
have
done
eagerly
and
with
a
vehement
rapidity
of
speech
singularly
at
variance
with
the
calm
and
almost
inanimate
tranquillity
of
her
usual
demeanor
she
related
to
orozimbo
without
remarking
her
the
wondrous
attempt
on
her
life
and
that
of
de
leon
if
she
was
not
surprised
however
at
the
vacancy
of
his
look
as
she
began
her
narrative
she
was
indeed
astonished
although
she
well
knew
the
excitability
of
his
nature
at
the
tremendous
burst
of
passion
with
which
he
replied
to
her
last
words
i
thank
the
great
spirit
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
and
shaking
his
hand
furiously
aloft
i
thank
the
great
spirit
that
it
is
so
this
this
alone
was
needful
to
banish
the
last
throb
of
compunction
to
extinguish
the
last
spark
of
mercy
or
of
friendship
in
my
soul
ha
ha
it
is
well
very
well
he
would
have
slain
thee
ha
let
him
look
to
himself
now
dog
and
villain
now
am
i
all
the
charib
now
am
i
all
my
country
s
give
me
my
arms
give
me
my
arms
guarica
i
am
but
wasting
time
of
tiger
skin
give
me
the
golden
buckler
the
strong
war
club
of
my
father
never
yet
was
it
brandished
in
more
just
or
holy
cause
give
me
hold
orozimbo
exclaimed
the
lovely
girl
now
terrified
by
his
continued
vehemence
what
mean
you
brother
for
what
should
i
give
you
arms
are
you
mad
that
you
dream
you
you
alone
o
seeking
out
this
spaniard
in
his
guarded
fortress
why
boy
the
very
sentinels
would
spurn
you
from
their
gates
will
they
ha
will
they
will
the
two
paltry
sentinels
who
stand
beside
their
empty
cannon
spurn
back
unconquered
caonabo
let
them
look
i
say
let
them
now
look
to
themselves
these
ravishing
and
murderous
spaniards
by
the
great
gods
they
shall
learn
and
that
ere
to
morrow
i
was
confused
and
i
became
hourly
more
and
more
interested
in
the
subject
my
caution
and
my
studies
and
sometimes
my
landlady
and
supper
were
equally
forgotten
i
became
something
of
an
amateur
in
music
though
after
the
few
first
days
my
eyes
were
probably
far
more
busy
than
my
ears
i
almost
lived
at
that
window
of
my
chamber
which
looked
out
upon
the
rookery
my
own
movements
at
length
came
to
be
almost
as
much
matter
of
observation
and
scrutiny
to
others
as
were
i
became
somewhat
indiscreet
in
the
watch
which
i
kept
over
her
not
content
with
the
advantages
of
my
position
i
was
tempted
forth
at
evening
by
the
sweet
song
of
the
syren
and
without
determining
upon
my
movements
by
the
exercise
of
any
previous
thinking
i
found
myself
finally
under
her
very
window
this
was
a
stretch
of
freedom
rather
large
for
one
who
had
usually
maintained
in
his
conduct
something
like
the
regimen
of
a
purist
it
was
an
indulgence
the
exercise
of
which
soon
brought
me
a
rebuke
which
if
it
did
not
fully
answer
the
intended
purpose
of
chiding
me
back
to
my
own
territory
at
least
served
to
remind
me
that
i
was
an
invader
of
that
of
another
the
second
time
that
i
ventured
to
cross
the
street
and
place
myself
beneath
the
window
of
the
musician
she
was
engaged
in
a
touching
little
ditty
which
i
had
never
heard
before
and
the
mournful
sweetness
of
which
brought
to
my
soul
as
i
listened
a
been
amply
satisfied
to
listen
from
my
own
chamber
had
not
the
tones
of
her
voice
been
unusually
low
there
was
that
night
a
faintness
in
her
utterance
which
seemed
to
denote
a
full
feeling
in
her
heart
of
the
sorrowful
sentiment
which
other
lips
only
sung
an
undefinable
curiosity
made
me
throw
by
my
books
extinguish
my
lamp
put
on
my
cap
and
steal
forth
to
the
rookery
the
evening
was
dark
a
faint
starlight
through
apertures
in
a
dense
mass
of
sullen
clouds
served
only
to
confuse
the
aspects
of
general
objects
and
secure
as
i
fancied
myself
from
all
observation
i
crossed
the
street
and
placed
myself
against
a
lamp
post
which
stood
in
front
of
the
miserable
dwelling
here
i
had
not
been
many
minutes
before
the
music
ceased
i
could
hear
a
brief
conversation
carried
on
in
low
but
harsh
tones
in
the
apartment
which
had
been
so
lately
the
prison
of
the
sweetest
song
the
mean
light
of
the
chamber
seemed
extinguished
and
while
i
below
suddenly
opened
and
i
was
abruptly
confronted
by
one
who
emerging
from
the
dwelling
in
almost
rude
accents
demanded
my
business
chapter
iv
there
was
surely
something
very
impertinent
in
the
demand
i
had
by
the
common
law
quite
as
much
right
to
be
where
he
found
me
as
any
body
so
long
as
my
presence
did
not
conflict
with
the
similar
rights
of
any
other
citizen
the
querist
was
a
man
slight
of
frame
apparently
decrepid
in
his
limbs
and
evidently
an
italian
i
could
see
by
the
lamplight
in
the
full
glare
of
which
he
stood
that
he
was
violently
agitated
his
thin
dark
features
were
almost
convulsed
his
lips
quivered
and
his
eyes
emitted
a
fiery
gleam
in
which
i
fancied
that
i
beheld
the
expression
of
a
very
malignant
and
personal
hostility
this
was
all
matter
of
very
curious
surprise
to
me
and
it
was
only
i
suppose
because
of
my
exceeding
surprise
that
i
did
not
demand
it
may
be
that
i
felt
also
that
however
justly
according
to
law
i
might
maintain
my
position
where
i
was
in
spite
of
him
or
any
body
else
yet
that
in
my
heart
and
some
of
its
desires
i
was
in
truth
a
trespasser
upon
his
rights
i
certainly
longed
to
get
into
his
household
if
it
were
his
and
to
gaze
my
fill
at
the
sweet
prisoner
bird
thereof
that
she
was
a
caged
songstress
i
could
not
allow
myself
to
doubt
i
had
caught
during
the
day
more
than
one
glimpse
of
her
sweet
sad
countenance
and
i
fancied
more
than
once
that
i
read
in
her
eyes
as
they
encountered
mine
the
yearning
to
be
free
perhaps
in
this
reading
of
her
eyes
my
boyish
vanity
led
me
to
fancy
that
i
saw
a
great
deal
more
perhaps
but
there
will
always
be
time
enough
for
the
confessional
enough
to
say
that
my
conscience
felt
under
other
circumstances
of
knocking
my
impertinent
querist
into
the
gutter
in
answer
to
his
demand
as
the
matter
was
i
hesitated
actually
stammered
and
failed
to
reply
in
a
satisfactory
manner
either
to
him
or
to
myself
until
provoked
to
a
right
feeling
of
resolution
by
the
repetition
in
broken
english
of
his
inquiry
what
you
do
here
what
you
want
the
style
of
the
question
was
unbearable
the
manner
in
which
his
face
was
thurst
forward
into
mine
was
not
to
be
endured
and
i
boldly
blunted
out
the
truth
or
that
which
was
truth
per
se
with
a
look
and
accent
of
defiance
i
stop
here
because
it
pleases
me
because
i
wish
to
hear
the
music
ah
ha
it
please
you
dis
music
eh
but
you
shall
be
go
to
you
place
you
shall
nevare
come
stop
here
no
more
nevare
and
the
shrivelled
angry
in
my
face
human
stomach
could
not
stand
this
and
an
involuntary
emotion
caused
me
to
double
my
fist
and
raise
my
arm
with
an
action
which
left
him
in
little
doubt
of
my
summary
intentions
he
receded
at
the
sight
and
as
i
fancied
in
order
to
effect
a
retreat
as
abrupt
as
had
been
his
entrance
upon
the
scene
but
i
was
mistaken
it
was
only
the
better
to
prepare
himself
for
defence
in
another
moment
a
stiletto
glittered
in
his
hand
and
he
assumed
an
attitude
of
the
most
determined
preparation
this
would
not
have
discouraged
me
wood
afforded
excellent
material
elsie
who
had
witnessed
the
accident
from
a
distance
was
at
first
unable
to
move
toward
the
spot
and
afterward
deterred
by
some
pangs
of
maidenly
jealousy
awakened
by
the
passionate
grief
of
her
sister
we
do
not
like
that
others
should
display
too
much
interest
in
those
who
ought
to
love
us
and
us
only
and
the
instinctive
feeling
of
resentment
is
apt
to
extend
itself
even
to
the
objects
of
such
impertinent
affection
so
poor
elsie
whose
came
at
once
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
either
have
been
deceived
throughout
or
that
her
young
admirer
had
proved
inconstant
and
her
uneasiness
took
the
form
of
high
displeasure
at
both
parties
concerned
with
some
share
of
the
same
feeling
towards
all
the
rest
of
the
world
including
her
own
silly
self
fenton
knocked
at
mr
lightbody
s
door
and
elsie
ran
and
hid
herself
in
the
garden
here
she
shed
tears
enough
to
have
watered
a
heavier
sorrow
and
in
the
very
tempest
of
her
passion
she
saw
her
false
love
and
her
cruel
sister
going
out
as
for
a
walk
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
the
thing
was
certain
and
the
blue
eyes
were
proudly
dried
to
be
swimming
again
the
very
next
moment
elsie
elsie
it
was
her
father
s
voice
and
summoning
new
resolution
she
wiped
away
the
intrusive
tears
and
hastened
to
the
house
in
the
keepin
room
she
encountered
mr
poppleton
and
his
youthful
reverend
mr
and
mrs
lightbody
sat
by
but
you
is
it
asked
the
good
man
after
brief
salutation
to
the
april
faced
maiden
then
checking
himself
he
added
but
that
is
nt
it
are
you
the
one
that
had
the
green
string
around
her
neck
t
other
day
that
was
the
one
we
wanted
elsie
answered
mechanically
yes
why
you
do
nt
look
so
chirk
as
you
did
then
you
ai
nt
sick
be
ye
this
brought
a
mechanical
no
oh
only
a
little
peakin
eh
well
now
you
see
we
ve
come
on
particular
business
mr
hammond
stands
in
need
of
a
helpmate
and
after
consulting
with
his
friends
and
also
getting
the
consent
and
good
will
of
your
honoured
father
he
wishes
to
know
if
you
could
be
agreeable
to
undertake
the
journey
of
life
mr
poppleton
began
the
blushing
mr
hammond
as
soon
as
he
could
edge
in
a
word
you
embarrass
the
young
lady
sir
allow
me
rejoined
the
elder
with
rather
a
severe
air
missionaries
and
missionaries
wives
must
not
be
fancy
led
like
the
vain
world
this
young
woman
has
been
well
brought
up
and
showed
her
duty
in
all
things
and
now
the
only
question
seems
to
me
to
be
whether
she
can
make
up
her
mind
to
renounce
vanity
and
folly
and
spend
the
rest
of
her
life
in
doing
good
and
upon
this
text
spoke
mr
poppleton
for
something
like
half
an
hour
aided
very
warmly
now
and
then
by
mr
lightbody
but
uninterrupted
by
any
body
else
his
discourse
had
so
much
the
air
of
a
sermon
that
it
would
have
seemed
impertinent
so
mr
hammond
thought
we
dare
say
to
have
attempted
to
refute
or
modify
any
of
its
positions
even
a
sermon
must
have
an
end
however
and
when
the
orator
had
gone
over
and
over
and
round
and
round
the
subject
till
he
felt
satisfied
with
his
exposition
of
it
he
turned
to
mrs
what
do
you
say
mrs
lightbody
remembered
though
she
did
not
tell
that
she
had
for
some
time
past
observed
certain
almost
intangible
indications
of
a
liking
for
somebody
else
and
she
therefore
referred
the
matter
to
elsie
herself
only
observing
that
a
good
minister
s
wife
was
a
great
blessing
to
the
people
what
was
her
surprise
when
elsie
who
had
been
gazing
out
of
the
window
turned
suddenly
to
her
father
and
gave
an
unconditional
and
almost
impetuous
consent
why
elsie
said
mrs
lightbody
she
s
right
said
the
deacon
rubbing
his
hands
i
hope
she
ll
be
a
burning
began
mr
poppleton
but
mr
hammond
looking
at
the
agitated
countenance
of
the
beautiful
girl
motioned
to
his
ally
to
cease
and
taking
her
hand
desired
her
to
compose
herself
saying
stiffly
enough
but
yet
kindly
that
he
would
give
her
no
further
trouble
at
present
but
would
call
again
in
a
day
or
departed
vi
kissing
the
lips
of
unacquainted
change
that
very
evening
when
the
two
fair
sisters
retired
to
their
chamber
did
ruth
drawing
encouragement
from
elsie
s
tearstained
cheeks
open
her
mission
how
different
from
the
other
it
was
a
tale
of
such
passionate
protestation
such
humble
suing
on
the
part
of
the
hero
of
the
hickory
nutting
that
elsie
stung
with
compunction
for
her
blind
precipitancy
called
and
thought
herself
the
most
wretched
of
human
beings
and
almost
frightened
her
more
placid
sister
by
the
vehemence
of
her
sorrow
fenton
loved
her
then
after
all
and
she
what
had
she
done
why
elsie
dear
said
the
soft
voiced
ruth
as
the
strickenhearted
girl
sobbed
upon
her
bosom
what
can
be
the
matter
i
used
to
think
you
liked
joe
fenton
oh
ruth
i
have
promised
promised
that
odious
old
poppleton
that
hateful
young
minister
and
here
tears
stopped
the
sad
story
who
was
a
matter
of
fact
little
body
oh
promised
to
be
a
missionary
to
go
and
live
in
the
woods
to
marry
that
oh
dear
oh
dear
to
marry
that
young
clergyman
why
elsie
how
can
you
call
him
hateful
he
is
as
much
handsomer
than
joe
fenton
as
handsome
i
do
nt
care
for
his
being
handsome
i
hate
him
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
him
oh
that
miserable
nutting
and
her
tears
poured
afresh
ruth
sat
in
musing
silence
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
condole
with
her
sister
upon
the
prospect
of
becoming
the
help
meet
of
so
attractive
a
missionary
and
she
was
unconsciously
balancing
in
her
own
mind
the
various
points
this
they
laughed
harder
than
ever
and
asked
me
if
i
lived
in
the
woods
and
did
nt
know
what
game
was
at
this
i
rather
think
i
laughed
yes
i
roared
and
says
strangers
if
you
d
asked
me
how
we
got
our
meat
in
arkansaw
i
d
a
told
you
at
once
and
given
you
a
list
of
varmints
that
would
make
a
caravan
beginning
with
the
bar
and
ending
off
with
the
cat
that
s
meat
though
not
game
game
indeed
that
s
what
city
folks
call
it
and
with
them
it
means
chippen
birds
and
shite
pokes
maybe
such
trash
live
in
my
diggins
any
way
is
too
trifling
i
never
did
shoot
at
but
one
and
i
d
never
forgiven
myself
for
that
had
it
weighed
less
than
forty
pounds
i
would
nt
draw
a
rifle
on
any
thing
less
than
that
and
when
i
meet
with
another
wild
turkey
of
the
same
weight
i
will
drap
him
a
wild
turkey
weighing
forty
pounds
exclaimed
twenty
voices
in
the
cabin
at
once
yes
strangers
and
was
nt
it
a
whopper
you
see
the
thing
was
so
fat
that
it
could
nt
fly
far
and
when
he
fell
out
of
the
tree
after
i
shot
him
on
striking
the
ground
he
bust
open
behind
and
the
way
the
pound
gobs
of
tallow
rolled
out
of
the
opening
was
perfectly
beautiful
where
did
all
that
happen
asked
a
cynical
looking
hoosier
happen
happened
in
arkansaw
where
else
could
it
have
happened
but
in
the
creation
state
the
finishing
up
country
a
state
where
the
sile
runs
government
gives
you
a
title
to
every
inch
of
it
then
its
airs
just
breathe
them
and
they
will
make
you
snort
like
a
horse
it
s
a
state
without
a
fault
it
is
excepting
mosquitoes
cried
the
hoosier
well
stranger
except
them
for
it
ar
a
fact
that
they
are
rather
enormous
and
do
push
themselves
in
somewhat
troublesome
but
stranger
they
never
stick
twice
in
the
same
place
and
give
them
a
fair
chance
for
a
few
months
and
you
will
get
as
much
above
noticing
them
as
an
alligator
they
ca
nt
hurt
my
feelings
for
they
lay
under
the
skin
and
i
never
knew
but
one
case
of
injury
resulting
from
them
and
that
was
to
a
yankee
and
they
take
worse
to
foreigners
any
how
than
they
do
to
natives
but
the
way
they
used
that
fellow
up
first
they
punched
him
until
he
swelled
up
and
busted
then
he
sup
per
a
ted
as
the
doctor
then
he
took
the
ager
owing
to
the
warm
weather
and
finally
he
took
a
steamboat
and
left
the
country
he
was
the
only
man
that
ever
took
mosquitoes
at
heart
that
i
know
of
but
mosquitoes
is
natur
and
i
never
find
fault
with
her
if
they
ar
large
arkansaw
is
large
her
varmints
ar
large
her
trees
ar
large
her
rivers
ar
large
and
a
small
mosquitoe
would
be
of
no
more
use
in
arkansaw
than
preaching
in
a
cane
brake
this
knock
down
argument
in
favour
of
big
mosquitoes
used
the
hoosier
up
and
the
logician
started
on
a
new
track
to
explain
how
numerous
bear
were
in
his
diggins
where
he
represented
them
to
be
about
as
plenty
as
blackberries
and
a
little
plentifuler
upon
the
utterance
of
this
assertion
a
timid
little
man
near
me
inquired
if
the
bear
in
arkansaw
ever
attacked
the
settlers
in
numbers
no
said
our
hero
warming
with
the
subject
no
of
bar
to
go
in
droves
but
the
way
they
squander
about
in
pairs
and
single
ones
in
edifying
and
then
the
way
i
hunt
them
the
old
black
rascals
know
the
crack
of
my
gun
as
well
as
they
know
a
pig
s
squealing
they
grow
thin
in
our
parts
it
frightens
them
so
and
they
do
take
the
noise
dreadfully
poor
things
that
gun
of
mine
is
a
perfect
epidemic
among
bar
if
not
watched
closely
it
will
go
off
as
quick
on
a
warm
scent
as
my
dog
bowie
knife
will
and
then
that
dog
whew
why
the
fellow
thinks
that
the
world
is
full
of
bar
he
finds
them
so
easy
it
s
lucky
he
do
nt
talk
as
well
as
think
for
with
his
natural
modesty
if
he
should
suddenly
learn
how
much
he
is
acknowledged
to
be
ahead
of
all
other
dogs
in
the
universe
he
would
be
astonished
to
death
in
two
minutes
strangers
that
dog
knows
a
bar
s
way
as
well
as
a
the
right
time
bites
at
the
exact
place
and
whips
without
getting
a
scratch
i
never
could
tell
whether
he
was
made
expressly
to
hunt
bar
or
whether
bar
was
made
expressly
for
him
to
hunt
any
way
i
believe
they
were
ordained
to
go
together
as
naturally
as
squire
jones
says
a
man
and
woman
is
when
he
moralizes
in
marrying
a
couple
in
fact
jones
once
said
said
he
marriage
according
to
law
is
a
civil
contract
of
divine
origin
it
s
common
to
all
countries
as
well
as
arkansaw
and
people
take
to
it
as
naturally
as

what
season
of

inquired
a
gentlemanly
foreigner
who
from
some
peculiarities
of
his
baggage
i
suspected
to
be
an
englishman
on
some
hunting
expedition
probably
at
the
foot
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
season
for
bar
hunting
stranger
said
the
man
of
arkansaw
is
generally
all
as
regular
i
read
in
history
that
varmints
have
their
fat
season
and
their
lean
season
that
is
not
the
case
in
arkansaw
feeding
as
they
do
upon
the
spontenacious
productions
of
the
sile
they
have
one
continued
fat
season
the
year
round
though
in
winter
things
in
this
way
is
rather
more
greasy
than
in
summer
i
must
admit
for
that
reason
bar
with
us
run
in
warm
weather
but
in
winter
they
only
who
seem
to
be

only
slumber
peacefully

they

longing
for
thy

a
yearning
for

above
a
wounded
spirit
is
the
one
to
feel
by
suffering
what
it
is
to
value
weal
i

to
lay
me
in
my

me
again
in
thy

and

my

spirit
on
thy
breast
the
only
one
that
ever
gave

thou
art
the

still
the

dear
creature
that
was

to
fill
my

with
unalloyed
delight
to
throw
such
sweet
enchantment
over

has

driven
me
to

which
soothed

with
an
answering
smile
methinks
if
i
had
been
there
by
thy
side
as
others
were
that
you
would
not
have
died
i
sometimes
seek
thee
in
the
calm
of
even
by
soaring
on
the
wings
of
thought
to
heaven
i
look
up
through
the
rifted
clouds
to
see
if
there
is
anything
in
heaven
like
thee
i
see
thee
in
the
noonday
waning

and
shall
be
with
thee
in
that
kingdom
soon
in
those
far
regions
of
delight
where
lie
the
golden
hills
of
immortality
and
like
the
mateless
dove
incessantly
i
go
on
tireless
wing
in
search
of
thee
but
finding
nowhere
in
this
world
to
rest
i
come
back
home
again
to
my
sad
nest
and
utter
my
lament
upon
this
bough
in
pensive
languishment
as
i
do
now
for
as
the
dove
with
her
soft
wings
will
hide
the
wound
that
has
been
bleeding
in
her
side
and
with
unmingled
feelings
of
despair
compress
the
arrow
that
is
quivering
there
so
did
my
pride
within
my
it
is
most
strange
that
music
has
the
power
to
call
up
childhood
from
its
earliest
hour
those
words
of
soft
endearment
spoke
by
thee
worth
all
the
praises
in
the
world
to
me
are
all
respoken
by
the
simplest
tone
resembling
but
an
image
of
thine
own
and
all
those
lineaments
that
once
were
thine
are
pictured
to
me
as
they
were
divine
as
when
we
occupied
whole
hours
of
talk
on
heavenly
things
beside
the
garden
walk
for
there
it
was
when
in
my
youthful
prime
i
used
to
wallow
on
sweet
beds
of
thyme
and
lying
there
some
pleasant
afternoon
would
gaze
up
fondly
at
the
full
round
moon
just
coming
out
of
heaven
as
if
to
see
what
holier
moon
was
watching
there
by
me
for
as
that
moon
her
little
stars
at
night
so
thou
didst
lead
me
to
the
realms
of
light
through
all
the
rich
plantations
of
thy
love
more
sweet
to
me
than
heaven
to
them
above
and
all
that
time
then
that
you
could
die
i
recollect
you
used
to
comb
my
hair
and
part
it
on
my
forehead
with
such
care
and
bending
down
above
me
on
your
knee
would
say
so
many
precious
things
to
me
and
give
me
oval
plums
of
purple
hue
sweeter
than
all
the
fruitage
of
meru
and
often
as
our
friendly
talk
went
on
how
often
would
you
call
me
your
dear
son
and
always
when
that
tender
talk
began
i
thought
if
i
could
only
be
a
man
i
would
be
happier
than
the
day
was
long
and
do
such
mighty
things
for
thee
none
wrong
until
it
seemed
by
wishing
it
to
be
i
was
a
man
in
cold
reality
but
since
that
time
before
my
youth
was
spent
i
have
had
many
reasons
to
lament
the
wish
i
made
for
it
was
just
as
vain
as
now
to
wish
myself
a
child
again
and
then
the
songs
that
you
would
sing
for
whose
melody
was
like
the
sweet
perfume
the
violet
sheds
upon
an
infant
s
tomb
which
flowed
as
liquid
as
a
wave
that
curls
around
an
island
in
the
sea
of
pearls
through
which
my
spirit
had
the
power
to
see
the
link
that
bound
you
to
the
deity
the
hours
as
if
their
wings
were
made
of
lead
have
moved
on
tardily
since
thou
wert
dead
i
have
forgotten
half
that
might
have
been
just
from
the
tardiness
of
each
long
scene
i
have
been
wounded
like
the
stricken
deer
flying
from
his
pursuers
in
the
rear
that
has
no
time
to
stop
upon
the
way
to
cool
his
parching
thirst
but
day
by
day
forever
farther
from
his
covert
flies
through
vistas
all
unknown
until
he
dies
so
ecstasy
and
here
were
songs
and
radiant
wings
for
nature
s
god
has
given
bright
plumes
to
all
melodious
things

they
may

her

was
rich
with

her

never

converse

would
sit
upon
a
mossy
rock
and
hold
communion
with
the
voyagers
of
those
white
clouds
that
flit
so
gracefully
along

these
were

stand
in

midnight

with

creatures

shed
balm
upon

for
the

of

and
we
who
dwelt
within
this

almost
deserted
dell
were
pleased
to
talk
with
her
who
understood
the
softest
whispers
of

thus
she
grew

and
having
received
satisfactory
replies
to
all

he
gave
himself
up
to
transports
of
exultation
such
as
his
own
most
confidential
freedman
never
before
had
witnessed
dismissing
the

he
strode
to
and

tossing

as
he
spoke
there
burst
close
over
head
an
appaling
crash
of
thunder
accompanied
by
a
flash
of
lightning
so
vivid
and
pervading
that
the
whole
tent
seemed
to
be
on
fire
the
terrified
greek
fell
to
the
earth
stunned
and
dazzled
but
the
audacious
and
insane
blasphemer
tossing
his
arms
and
lifting
his
front
proudly
exclaimed
with
his
cynical
sneer
if
ye

i
defy
your

noise
your
harmless
thunder
for

or

blaze
succeeded
blaze
and
crash
followed
crash
with
such
tremendous
rapidity
that
the
whole
heavens
nay
the
whole
atmosphere
appeared
incandescent
with
white
sulphureous
omnipresent
fire
and
that
the
roar
of
the
volleyed
thunder
was
continuous
and
incessant
still
the
fierce
traitor
blenched
not
crime
and
his
head
frenzied
to
his
own
destruction
but
the
winter
storm
in
the
mountains
was
as
brief
as
it
was
sudden
and
tremendous
and
it
ceased
as
abruptly
as
it
broke
out
unexpectedly
a
tempest
of
hail
came
pelting
down
the
grape
shot
as
it
were
of
that
heavenly
artillery
scourging
the
earth
with
furious
force
during
ten
minutes
more
and
then
the
night
was
as
serene
and
tranquil
as
it
had
been
before
that
elemental
uproar
as
the
last
flash
of
lightning
flickered
faintly
away
and
the
last
thunder
roll
died
out
in
the
sky
catiline
stirred
the
freedman
with
his
foot
get
up
thou
coward
fool
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
there
are
no

lo
you
now
for
what
should
they
have

trumpery
pother
if
not
to

sergius
catiline
asked
the
greek
scarce
daring
to
raise
his
head
from
the
ground
did
not
judge
if
i
be
dead
fool
by
this
and
this
and
this
and
with
each
word
he
kicked
and
trampled
on
the
grovelling
wretch
with
such
savage
violence
and
fury
that
he
bellowed
and
howled
for
mercy
and
was
scarce
able
to
creep
out
of
the
apartment
when
he
ceased
stamping
upon
him
and
ordered
him
to
begone
speedily
and
bring
his
charger
ere
many
minutes
had
elapsed
the
traitor
was
on
horse
back
and
issuing
from
the
gates
of
his
camp
into
the
calm
and
starry
night
he
drove
with
his
escort
at
his
heels
with
the
impetuosity
and
din
of
a
whirlwind
waking
the
mountain
echoes
by
the
clang
of
the
thundering
hoofs
and
the
clash
of
the
brazen
armor
and
steel
scabbards
down
the
steep
defile
toward

chapter

the
watchtower
of

our
castle
s
strength
will
laugh
a
siege
to
scorn
macbeth
the
watchtower
in
which
caius
crispus
and
his
gang
had
taken
refuge
from
many
of
which
had
been
perched
in
the
olden
time
on
the
summits
of
the
jutting
crags
or
in
the
passes
of
the
appennines
but
most
of
which
had
fallen
long
before
into
utter
ruin
some
had
been
destroyed
in
the
border
wars
of
the
innumerable
petty
tribes
which
ere
the
romans
became
masters
of
the
peninsula
divided
among
themselves
that
portion
of
italy
and
held
it
in
continual
turmoil
with
their
incessant
wars
and
forays
some
had
mouldered
away
by
the
slow
hand
of
ruthless
time
and
yet
more
had
been
pulled
down
for
the
sake
of
their
materials
which
now
filled
a
more
useful
if
less
glorious
station
in
the
enclosures
of
tilled
fields
and
the
walls
of
rustic
dwellings
from
such
a
fate
the
watchtower
of
usella
had
been
saved
by
several
accidents
its
natural
and
artificial
strength
had
prevented
its
sack
or
storm
during
the
earlier
period
of
its
existence
the
difficulty
of
approaching
it
had
saved
its
solid
masonry
from
the
cupidity
of
the
rural
proprietors
and
the
great
hill
passes
into
cisalpine
gaul
had
induced
the
roman
government
to
retain
it
in
use
as
a
fortified
post
so
long
as
their
gallic
neighbors
were
half
subdued
only
and
capable
of
giving
them
trouble
by
their
tumultuous
incursions
although
it
had
consisted
therefore
in
the
first
instance
of
little
more
than
a
rude
circular
tower
of
that
architecture
called
cyclopean
additions
had
been
made
to
it
by
the
romans
of
a
strong
brick
wall
with
a
parapet
enclosing
a
space
of
about
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
accessible
only
by
a
single
gateway
with
a
steep
and
narrow
path
leading
to
it
and
thoroughly
commanded
by
the
tower
itself
in
front
this
wall
was
founded
on
a
rough
craggy
bank
of
some
thirty
feet
in
height
rising
from
the
main
road
traversing
the
defile
by
which
alone
it
could
be
approached
for
on
the
right
and
left
the
rocks
had
been
scarped
artificially
and
in
the
rear
there
was
a
natural
gorge
through
which
a
feet
in
depth
although
an
arch
of
twenty
foot
span
would
have
crossed
the
ravine
with
ease
against
the
wall
at
this
point
on
the
inner
side
the
broken
neck
why
it
looks
blacker
than
our
ship
s
hold
and
the
roar
of
those
waterfalls
down
there
would
batter
one
s
brains
to
pieces
oh
no
toby
i
exclaimed
laughing
but
there
s
something
to
be
seen
here
that
s
plain
or
there
would
have
been
no
path
and
i
am
resolved
to
find
out
what
it
is
i
will
tell
you
what
my
pleasant
fellow
rejoined
toby
quickly
if
you
are
going
to
pry
into
everything
you
meet
with
here
that
excites
your
curiosity
you
will
marvellously
soon
get
knocked
on
the
head
to
a
dead
certainty
you
will
come
bang
upon
a
party
of
these
savages
in
the
midst
of
your
discovery
makings
and
i
doubt
whether
such
an
event
would
particularly
delight
you
just
take
my
advice
for
once
and
let
us
bout
ship
and
steer
in
some
other
direction
besides
it
s
getting
late
and
we
ought
to
be
mooring
ourselves
for
the
night
driving
at
replied
i
and
i
am
thinking
that
this
ravine
will
exactly
answer
our
purpose
for
it
is
roomy
secluded
well
watered
and
may
shelter
us
from
the
weather
aye
and
from
sleep
too
and
by
the
same
token
will
give
us
sore
throats
and
rheumatisms
into
the
bargain
cried
toby
with
evident
dislike
at
the
idea
oh
very
well
then
my
lad
said
i
since
you
will
not
accompany
me
here
i
go
alone
you
will
see
me
in
the
morning
and
advancing
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
upon
which
we
had
been
standing
i
proceeded
to
lower
myself
down
by
the
tangled
roots
which
clustered
about
all
the
crevices
of
the
rock
as
i
had
anticipated
toby
in
spite
of
his
previous
remonstrances
followed
my
example
and
dropping
himself
with
the
activity
of
a
squirrel
from
point
to
point
he
quickly
outstripped
me
and
effected
a
landing
at
the
bottom
before
that
now
greeted
us
was
one
that
will
ever
be
vividly
impressed
upon
my
mind
five
foaming
streams
rushing
through
as
many
gorges
and
swelled
and
turbid
by
the
recent
rains
united
together
in
one
mad
plunge
of
nearly
eighty
feet
and
fell
with
wild
uproar
into
a
deep
black
pool
scooped
out
of
the
gloomy
looking
rocks
that
lay
piled
around
and
thence
in
one
collected
body
dashed
down
a
narrow
sloping
channel
which
seemed
to
penetrate
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
overhead
vast
roots
of
trees
hung
down
from
the
sides
of
the
ravine
dripping
with
moisture
and
trembling
with
the
concussions
produced
by
the
fall
it
was
now
sunset
and
the
feeble
uncertain
light
that
found
its
way
into
these
caverns
and
woody
depths
heightened
their
strange
appearance
and
reminded
us
that
in
a
short
time
we
should
find
ourselves
in
utter
darkness
as
soon
as
i
had
satisfied
my
curiosity
by
gazing
at
this
scene
i
fell
to
wondering
how
it
was
that
what
we
had
taken
for
a
path
should
began
to
suspect
that
after
all
i
might
have
been
deceived
in
supposing
it
to
have
been
a
trick
formed
by
the
islanders
this
was
rather
an
agreeable
reflection
than
otherwise
for
it
diminished
our
dread
of
accidentally
meeting
with
any
of
them
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
perhaps
we
could
not
have
selected
a
more
secure
hiding
place
than
this
very
spot
we
had
so
accidentally
hit
upon
toby
agreed
with
me
in
this
view
of
the
matter
and
we
immediately
began
gathering
together
the
limbs
of
trees
which
lay
scattered
about
with
the
view
of
constructing
a
temporary
hut
for
the
night
this
we
were
obliged
to
build
close
to
the
foot
of
the
cataract
for
the
current
of
water
extended
very
nearly
to
the
sides
of
the
gorge
the
few
moments
of
light
that
remained
we
employed
in
covering
our
hut
with
a
species
of
broad
bladed
grass
that
grew
in
every
fissure
of
the
ravine
our
hut
if
it
deserved
to
be
called
one
consisted
of
six
or
eight
of
the
straightest
branches
we
could
with
their
lower
ends
within
a
foot
of
the
stream
into
the
space
thus
covered
over
we
managed
to
crawl
and
dispose
our
wearied
bodies
as
best
we
could
shall
i
ever
forget
that
horrid
night
as
for
poor
toby
i
could
scarcely
get
a
word
out
of
him
it
would
have
been
some
consolation
to
have
heard
his
voice
but
he
lay
shivering
the
live
long
night
like
a
man
afflicted
with
the
palsy
with
his
knees
drawn
up
to
his
head
while
his
back
was
supported
against
the
dripping
side
of
the
rock
during
this
wretched
night
there
seemed
nothing
wanting
to
complete
the
perfect
misery
of
our
condition
the
rain
descended
in
such
torrents
that
our
poor
shelter
proved
a
mere
mockery
in
vain
did
i
try
to
elude
the
incessant
streams
that
poured
upon
me
by
protecting
one
part
i
only
exposed
another
and
the
water
was
continually
finding
some
new
opening
through
which
to
drench
us
i
have
had
many
a
ducking
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
in
general
that
night
the
deathlike
coldness
of
the
place
the
appalling
darkness
and
the
dismal
sense
of
our
forlorn
condition
almost
unmanned
me
it
will
not
be
doubted
that
the
next
morning
we
were
early
risers
and
as
soon
as
i
could
catch
the
faintest
glimpse
of
anything
like
daylight
i
shook
my
companion
by
the
arm
and
told
him
it
was
sunrise
poor
toby
lifted
up
his
head
and
after
a
moment
s
pause
said
in
a
husky
voice
then
shipmate
my
toplights
have
gone
out
for
it
appears
darker
now
with
my
eyes
open
that
it
did
when
they
were
shut
nonsense
exclaimed
i
you
are
not
awake
yet
awake
roared
toby
in
a
rage
awake
you
mean
to
insinuate
i
ve
been
asleep
do
you
it
is
an
insult
to
a
man
to
suppose
he
could
sleep
in
such
an
infernal
place
as
this
by
the
time
i
had
the
marquis
of
ross
go
on
i
see
your
story
chimes
well
with
what
i
was
led
to
believe
seeing
i
remained
standing
he
immediately
rose
again
and
for
a
moment
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
how
to
address
to
me
what
he
had
to
say
at
length
he
said
with
a
smile
though
it
was
a
smile
which
went
no
deeper
than
the
muscles
of
his
face
i
believe
captain
you
are
the
brave
fellow
who
took
the
despatches
to
nelson
i
had
that
honor
sir
i
answered
admiral
collingwood
has
spoken
highly
of
you
i
respect
him
greatly
sir
i
answered
through
his
recommendations
captain
vance
said
the
marquis
you
are
about
to
be
entrusted
with
a
commission
of
great
importance
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
acquit
yourself
with
credit
it
is
however
a
matter
of
the
strictest
secresy
and
must
be
conducted
on
your
part
with
the
most
implicit
obedience
to
those
who
employ
you
and
who
are
those
who
employ
me
i
asked
and
what
is
the
nature
of
the
though
a
smuggler
by
profession
i
have
certain
ideas
of
honor
and
conscience
doubtless
you
have
said
the
gentleman
smiling
in
the
first
place
i
am
one
who
will
employ
you
i
am
the
marquis
of
ross
but
there
are
higher
persons
interested
in
this
matter
even
than
i
hear
from
me
captain
vance
what
is
required
of
you
there
is
in
the
boat
a
deaf
and
dumb
person
a
woman
who
has
with
her
a
small
child
a
few
months
old
you
are
to
take
this
woman
and
child
and
convey
them
to
the
island
of
bermuda
upon
reaching
that
destination
you
will
land
by
night
upon
the
black
keys
near
the
fortress
that
protects
the
harbour
by
that
fortress
is
a
path
which
leads
leads
to
here
the
marquis
cast
his
eyes
upon
a
memorandum
which
he
held
in
his
hand
as
if
to
read
some
minutes
and
then
proceeded
leads
by
a
group
of
larch
trees
to
a
cottage
and
a
short
walk
from
the
town
this
cottage
which
is
very
retired
yet
commands
a
view
of
the
sea

inhabited
by
a
man
and
woman
by
the
name
of
oakford

these
persons

in

faith
and
secrecy
and
receive
at
the
end
this
large
reward
who
is
the
woman
and
her
babe
i
asked
of
the
marquis
that
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
know
it
is
of
importance
that
she
should
be
sent
to
bermuda
for
the

my
lord

asked
you

at
liberty
to
guess
but
not
to
know
he
responded
shall
i
order
them
on
board
i
answered
for
five
thousand
pounds
four
thousand
to
be
paid
me
when
it
is
done
one
thousand
pounds
down
i
agree
to
this
answered
the
marquis
without
hesitation
you
shall
have
the
money
in
a
bank
of
england
note
i
have
one
purposely
with
me
for
i
anticipated
some
such
demand
the
marquis
then
took
out
of
his
pocket
book
a
note
for
that
sum
and
placed
it
in
my
hands
he
then
went
on
deck
and
i
followed
him
he
walked
to
the
side
and
stepping
down
into
the
boat
for
it
was
but
a
step
my
vessel
was
so
low
in
the
water
and
touched
the
female
on
the
arm
by
a
light
which
was
held
by
the
boy
nick
i
saw
that
she
was
a
small
delicate
looking
person
with
those
large
speaking
eyes
which
deaf
and
dumb
people
have
and
which
can
not
deceive
one
she
was
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
held
enveloped
in
her
arms
the
infant
assisted
her
to
the
deck
and
led
her
at
once
to
the
cabin
you
have
two
cabins
he
said
as
i
went
after
him
so
that
it
wont
put
you
out
at
all
the
female
can
have
the
after
cabin
with
the
child
now
i
will
leave
them
to
your
charge
with
this
he
went
up
to
the
young
woman
and
taking
her
hand
pressed
it
and
touched
her
forehead
he
also
made
certain
unintelligible
gestures
with
his
fingers
and
she
replied
to
them
in
the
same
way
calmly
and
as
if
she
felt
no
emotion
at
going
on
the
voyage
or
leaving
england
in
such
a
manner
you
need
not
take
any
trouble
to
try
and
make
her
hear
vance
said
the
marquis
for
she
was
born
a
deaf
mute
and
understands
only
the
language
of
signs
treat
her
kindly
i
pray
you
and
the
infant
also
she
will
be
able
to
state
on
her
arrival
to
the
man
oakford
how
she
has
to
her
it
may
affect
your
reward
in
its
aggregate
amount
i
answered
his
lordship
that
though
a
smuggler
i
had
no
heart
to
treat
a
woman
unkindly
especially
a
mute
and
that
i
should
now
that
i
had
undertaken
the
affair
try
and
make
her
as
happy
as
i
could
at
hearing
me
say
this
the
marquis
thanked
me
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
wished
me
a
pleasant
voyage
and
got
over
the
side
into
his
boat
he
gave
his
men
orders
to
put
off
and
in
a
few
moments
as
i
watched
his
retiring
form
he
disappeared
from
my
sight
in
the
darkness
of
the
silent
shores
i
soon
after
heard
a
carriage
roll
rapidly
away
along
the
river
road
and
the
sound
of
one
or
two
horsemen
galloping
along
with
it
wondering
much
at
the
mystery
connected
with
all
these
movements
and
resolved
to
do
my
best
some
time
or
other
to
find
out
the
whole
secret
i
gave
orders
to
weigh
anchor
and
make
sail
under
canvass
long
as
she
could
have
health
to
knit
or
howard
her
son
skill
in
trouting
he
was
now
down
the
glen
with
his
spear
and
lines
while
she
sat
in
her
door
suddenly
she
heard
a
loud
outcry
down
the
brook
it
was
the
voice
of
howard
and
its
tone
she
dropped
her
knitting
and
hastened
along
the
wild
pathway
by
the
edge
of
the
foaming
torrent
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
her
son
standing
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
which
overhung
a
dark
basin
in
which
the
water
was
many
feet
deep
he
was
mid
waist
in
the
water
and
support
ing
with
difficulty
the
head
of
a
man
above
the
surface
his
body
being
entirely
beneath
it
come
quickly
dear
mother
help
me
soon
for
i
can
hardly
keep
him
above
water
it
is
the
foreign
gentleman
from
the
house
exclaimed
mrs
holley
on
seeing
the
pale
and
lifeless
features
but
without
pausing
to
express
her
surprise
or
at
that
time
put
questions
as
to
the
manner
of
the
accident
she
clambered
down
the
rocky
sides
of
the
basin
and
gave
howard
her
assistance
with
great
difficulty
they
succeeded
in
drawing
him
from
the
basin
and
laying
him
upon
a
rock
covered
with
thick
moss
like
a
couch
of
velvet
here
they
both
applied
the
best
means
in
their
power
to
his
mother
as
she
was
rubbing
his
temples
you
see
mother
i
was
down
there
upon
that
rock
watching
for
the
trout
to
dart
by
and
spear
them
answered
howard
a
finelooking
boy
with
a
free
spirited
air
this
foreign
gentleman
came
up
the
path
and
smiling
asked
me
in
his
bad
english
if
i
caught
many
fish
and
then
after
looking
at
me
a
little
while
he
went
round
the
basin
and
began
to
ascend
the
crag
he
had
got
up
about
twelve
feet
when
a
part
of
the
rock
on
which
he
pressed
his
foot
broke
off
for
you
know
what
a
heavy
man
he
is
and
he
fell
over
into
the
basin
i
shrieked
out
and
ran
to
his
aid
he
did
nt
rise
and
suspecting
he
had
struck
his
head
i
jumped
in
and
diving
down
raised
up
his
head
out
of
the
water
what
a
providence
you
were
by
my
child
what
shall
now
be
done
mother
no
he
is
only
insensible
ca
nt
we
get
him
to
the
cottage
not
alone
ah
here
is
john
the
farm
man
from
the
house
john
come
here
quickly
cried
howard
to
a
country
fellow
here
is
your
master
s
guest
who
has
had
a
fall
and
is
now
almost
dead
help
us
get
him
into
the
cottage
and
then
run
and
tell
him
what
has
happened
my
master
is
as
good
a
doctor
as
the
best
responded
john
as
he
looked
upon
the
gentleman
well
it
is
a
pity
he
should
have
had
such
a
fall
but
what
can
be
expected
o
foreigners
that
do
nt
know
how
to
climb
nor
move
about
in
the
woods
i
ve
prophesied
this
afore
when
i
ve
seen
him
walk
up
and
down
the
rocks
the
stranger
was
borne
to
the
cabin
and
john
sent
off
after
his
master
in
the
meanwhile
the
mother
and
son
by
the
as
to
restore
animation
the
gentleman
after
opening
his
eyes
and
looking
around
him
a
moment
wildly
at
length
seemed
to
recollect
himself
and
be
conscious
of
his
situation
he
sat
up
and
looking
gratefully
upon
them
he
said
in
broken
english
i
have
had
a
fall
i
believe
i
remember
falling
i
find
myself
here
and
i
owe
you
my
life
for
my
wet
garments
tell
me
i
was
plunged
into
the
basin
i
saw
you
falling
sir
answered
howard
you
must
have
struck
your
head
against
the
bottom
for
you
did
not
rise
again
i
dove
down
and
got
your
head
above
the
surface
we
then
brought
you
here
and
have
sent
for
the
english
gentleman
how
can
i
ever
repay
you
for
your
act
my
lad
said
the
foreigner
taking
his
hand
and
you
too
madam
i
do
nt
wish
any
other
reward
than
seeing
you
well
again
sir
answered
both
you
trust
i
shall
be
able
one
day
to
reward
you
while
he
was
speaking
his
host
entered
followed
by
three
or
four
men
the
pleasure
of
the
former
on
finding
his
guest
revived
and
less
hurt
than
he
expected
was
very
great
he
repeated
also
expressions
of
thanks
to
the
family
who
had
done
so
much
for
the
stranger
and
assuring
mrs
holley
he
should
never
forget
her
or
her
son
for
her
act
of
mercy
and
kind
attentions
he
soon
departed
with
the
stranger
leaning
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
two
men
after
a
few
days
the
foreigner
entirely
recovered
and
prepared
for
his
departure
before
leaving
however
he
called
at
the
cottage
and
warmly
renewed
his
expressions
of
gratitude
calling
howard
the
preserver
of
his
life
upon
each
of
them
he
bestowed
a
trifling
present
i
am
poor
or
i
would
reward
you
with
much
money
to
make
you
comfortable
he
said
but
i
am
a
wanderer
an
exile
and
am
dependent
upon
the
bounty
of
and
the
same
evening
descended
the
river
the
proprietor
of
the
villa
did
not
forget
the
residents
of
the
cabin
he
made
their
situation
more
comfortable
and
gave
howard
the
privilege
of
studying
at
the
great
house
with
his
own
children
who
had
an
english
tutor
ten
years
passed
away
howard
had
gone
to
sea
at
the
age
of
sixteen
and
at
the
age
of
twenty
four
became
a
captain
he
had
made
more
comfortable
his
mother
s
cabin
converting
it
into
a
beautiful
cottage
here
she
lived
with
howard
s
young
wife
for
he
had
married
at
twenty
two
at
length
one
day
news
came
from
him
that
he
had
lost
his
ship
and
all
that
he
was
worth
thankful
that
his
life
was
spared
they
both
forgot
the
loss
of
mere
worldly
with
their
fair
leaves
and
clasping
tendrils
the
education
of
children
gave
early
prominence
to
the
moravian
establishments
of
bethlehem
and
nazareth
one
by
its
system
of
instruction
for
girls
and
the
other
for
boys
acquired
deserved
celebrity
from
different
and
distant
parts
of
these
states
then
newly
united
after
the
war
of
revolution
parents
sent
thither
the
young
scions
of
their
pride
and
hope
those
who
made
religion
without
controversy
the
root
of
all
their
teachings
appealed
to
it
in
sorrow
as
their
consolation
derived
from
it
the
rudiments
of
a
selfdenying
benevolence
mingled
it
as
a
heightening
principle
with
every
joy
and
wore
its
semblance
on
their
brow
in
the
smile
that
childhood
loves
nazareth
by
its
seclusion
from
temptation
and
evil
example
revealed
peculiar
facilities
for
a
nursery
of
the
young
mind
it
has
been
mentioned
that
it
was
distinguished
by
its
excellent
school
for
boys
the
female
children
of
the
village
and
a
few
others
were
also
favored
in
being
placed
under
the
immediate
charge
of
the
single
sisters
in
this
employment
malvina
found
delightful
scope
for
her
active
virtues
and
her
ever
growing
benevolence
to
the
lonely
and
chastened
spirit
no
vocation
is
more
salutary
than
that
of
instructing
the
young
association
with
the
unbowed
and
healthful
heart
imparts
elasticity
to
that
which
has
painfully
realized
either
the
world
s
emptiness
or
its
own
infirmity
to
feel
the
consciousness
to
the
enraptured
mind
to
gather
those
grateful
affections
whose
root
is
in
that
rapture
are
unspeakable
privileges
malvina
by
the
gracefulness
of
true
goodness
taught
her
pupils
the
happiness
that
it
inspires
she
walked
before
them
as
a
good
angel
willing
a
while
to
leave
heaven
s
bright
heritage
for
their
sakes
the
precepts
by
which
she
allured
them
to
piety
were
the
holy
smile
that
she
wore
and
the
trusting
prayer
that
she
taught
them
to
breathe
both
in
sorrow
and
in
joy
thus
years
passed
over
her
leaving
her
still
beautiful
time
seemed
to
cast
on
her
neither
spot
nor
wrinkle
nor
any
such
thing
his
commission
respecting
her
was
to
modify
not
to
extinguish
or
to
take
away
for
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
beauty
which
rests
not
on
a
set
of
features
or
complexion
but
on
the
tincture
of
the
soul
in
the
trials
and
causes
of
irritation
which
sometimes
befell
her
for
what
earthly
lot
excludes
them
be
i
am
silent
i
offer
myself
in
sacrifice
while
the
brightness
ever
beaming
from
her
eye
replied
as
if
in
rebuke
no
not
sacrifice
glad
incense
a
hymn
of
praise
gathering
around
her
the
little
group
that
she
so
loved
to
guide
she
sometimes
said
my
office
reminds
me
of
a
dream
that
i
once
had
in
my
childhood
methought
i
was
feeding
a
white
lamb
from
a
cup
of
milk
while
it
took
the
food
it
looked
lovingly
up
to
me
as
to
its
mother
then
a
voice
as
of
the
harp
spake
from
the
high
clouds
bring
the
lamb
unto
me
and
i
said
i
will
lord
for
i
thought
it
was
the
voice
of
the
lamb
that
was
slain
for
us
i
awoke
and
gave
that
sweet
dream
to
memory
that
she
might
keep
it
among
her
honey
blossoms
now
when
she
brings
it
freshly
back
it
seems
that
you
white
lamb
then
i
pour
out
for
you
the
pure
milk
of
the
word
and
the
spirit
of
my
vision
forms
itself
into
a
prayer
and
to
the
charge
of
my
savior
bring
them
every
one
to
me
i
answer
perhaps
too
fondly
i
will
lord
help
me
blessed
ones
that
my
promise
be
not
in
vain
it
was
once
near
the
close
of
a
long
and
cloudless
summer
sabbath
that
the
sun
drawing
toward
his
rest
cast
upon
the
peaceful
roofs
and
quiet
shades
of
nazareth
a
flood
of
unwonted
brilliance
a
train
was
seen
slowly
pursuing
a
path
over
the
brow
of
a
verdant
hill
in
the
center
of
the
village
passing
without
a
glance
the
beautiful
public
garden
with
its
deep
recesses
and
glowing
plants
and
arbors
and
fountains
they
approached
the
cemetery
whose
gate
was
near
that
of
this
ornamented
domain
as
if
to
teach
the
reflecting
mind
that
the
exit
and
entrance
of
life
are
scarcely
divided
ancient
judea
may
find
in
his
garden
a
sepulcher
they
paused
at
the
gate
of
the
city
of
the
dead
music
from
wind
instruments
mingling
with
deeptoned
voices
swelled
out
on
the
soft
breeze
touching
the
fountain
of
tender
tears
at
first
it
was
plaintive
as
if
bidding
farewell
to
beloved
scenes
in
the
name
of
the
sleeper
upon
the
bier
then
thrilling
more
wildly
it
seemed
to
implore
of
the
genius
of
that
hallowed
spot
room
for
a
new
habitant
a
narrow
chamber
where
he
might
be
troubled
no
more
they
entered
the
place
of
tombs
neither
weed
nor
bramble
nor
shadow
of
gloom
defaced
it
over
every
grave
flowers
and
aromatic
shrubs
clustered
and
were
so
thickly
interwoven
that
the
horizontal
stone
bearing
the
name
of
the
tenant
below
was
partially
hidden
from
view
at
an
open
grave
the
procession
stayed
the
solemn
service
in
the
deep
german
intonations
from
the
lips
of
the
venerable
pastor
drew
deeper
power
from
the
surrounding
scenery
treasure
there
was
such
a
burst
of
melody
of
him
who
conquered
death
and
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
through
the
gospel
that
the
consignment
of
earth
to
earth
was
not
in
tears
but
in
joyous
hope
surely
music
should
consecrate
the
tomb
when
it
takes
the
christian
to
its
bosom
she
hath
a
right
to
stand
wherever
faith
plants
an
anchor
she
announced
to
the
shepherds
the
coming
of
him
who
is
our
salvation
let
her
lift
up
her
voice
when
the
soul
returneth
to
his
arms
it
is
fitting
that
the
shrouded
form
which
at
the
last
day
shall
come
forth
in
glory
should
go
to
its
turf
pillow
with
a
sacred
song
what
right
have
despair
of
our
boys
do
not
feel
themselves
in
tune
unless
they
have
a
pistol
accompaniment
men
are
locked
up
or
fined
if
found
with
daggers
or
slung
shot
upon
their
persons
but
revolvers
go
free
as
pistol
the
former
may
let
the
victim
escape
minus
a
good
large
slice
but
the
latter
is
apt
to
drop
him
dead
on
the
frontiers
or
engaged
in
police
duty
firearms
may
be
necessary
but
in
the
ordinary
walk
of
life
pistols
are
to
say
the
least
a
superfluity
better
empty
your
pockets
of
these
dangerous
weapons
and
see
that
your
sons
do
not
carry
them
in
all
the
ordinary
walks
of
life
an
honest
countenance
and
orderly
behavior
are
sufficient
defence
you
had
better
stop
going
into
society
where
you
must
always
be
ready
to
shoot
somebody
but
do
not
think
my
dear
fred
that
i
am
opposed
to
everything
because
i
have
this
evening
spoken
against
so
many
different
things
i
can
not
take
the
part
of
those
who
pride
themselves
in
hurling
a
stout
no
against
everything
a
friend
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
sanballat
wanted
to
hold
consultation
with
nehemiah
in
the
plain
of
o
no
that
is
the
place
where
more
people
stay
to
day
throwing
doubt
on
grand
undertakings
and
while
you
are
in
the
mountain
of
o
yes
they
spend
their
time
on
the
plain
of
o
no
in
the
harness
of
society
they
are
breeching
straps
good
for
nothing
but
to
hold
back
you
propose
to
call
a
minister
all
the
indications
are
that
he
is
the
right
man
nine
tenths
of
the
congregation
are
united
in
his
favor
the
matter
is
put
to
vote
the
vast
majority
say
ay
the
handful
of
opponents
responded
o
no
you
propose
to
build
a
new
church
about
the
site
the
choice
of
architect
the
upholstery
the
plumbing
and
the
day
of
dedication
there
is
almost
a
unanimity
you
hope
that
the
crooked
sticks
will
all
lie
still
and
that
the
congregation
will
move
in
solid
phalanx
but
not
so
sanballat
sends
for
nehemiah
proposing
to
meet
him
in
the
plain
of
o
no
some
men
were
born
backward
and
have
been
going
that
way
ever
since
opposition
to
everything
has
become
chronic
the
face
toward
the
whiffletree
and
their
back
to
the
end
of
the
shafts
they
may
set
down
their
name
in
the
hotel
register
as
living
in
boston
chicago
savannah
or
brooklyn
but
they
really
have
been
spending
all
their
lives
on
the
plain
of
o
no
there
let
them
be
buried
with
their
face
toward
the
west
for
in
that
way
they
will
lie
more
comfortably
as
other
people
are
buried
with
their
face
to
the
east
do
not
impose
upon
them
by
putting
them
in
the
majority
o
no
we
rejoice
that
there
seems
more
liberality
among
good
men
and
that
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
let
each
one
work
in
his
own
way
the
scalping
knives
are
being
dulled
the
cheerfulness
and
good
humor
which
have
this
year
characterized
our
church
courts
is
remarkable
and
in
strong
contrast
with
the
old
time
ecclesiastical
fights
which
shook
synods
and
conferences
religious
controversies
always
have
been
the
most
bitter
of
all
controversies
and
when
ministers
do
fight
they
fight
like
vengeance
once
a
church
court
own
time
in
sharp
contention
but
would
leave
the
religious
community
to
continue
the
quarrel
after
adjournment
now
they
have
a
time
of
good
cheer
while
in
convention
and
leave
only
one
dispute
behind
them
among
the
families
and
that
arising
from
the
fact
that
each
one
claims
it
had
the
best
ministers
and
elders
at
their
house
contention
is
a
child
of
the
darkness
peace
the
daughter
of
the
light
the
only
help
for
a
cow
s
hollow
horn
is
a
gimlet
hole
bored
through
it
and
the
best
way
to
cure
religious
combatants
is
to
let
more
gospel
light
through
their
antlers
as
we
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
interested
in
all
that
was
going
on
and
saw
governor
wiseman
with
his
honorable
name
and
quizzle
and
heavy
as
bricks
with
their
unattractive
titles
we
thought
of
the
affliction
of
an
awkward
or
ill
omened
name
when
there
are
so
many
pleasant
names
by
which
children
may
be
called
what
right
has
a
parent
to
place
on
his
child
s
head
a
disadvantage
at
the
start
which
the
little
ones
have
to
run
is
this
parental
outrage
what
a
struggle
in
life
that
child
will
have
who
has
been
baptized
jedekiah
or
mehitabel
if
a
child
is
called
after
some
one
living
let
that
one
be
past
mid
life
and
of
such
temperament
that
there
shall
be
no
danger
of
his
becoming
an
absconder
and
a
cheat
as
far
as
possible
let
the
name
given
be
short
so
that
in
the
course
of
a
lifetime
there
be
not
too
many
weeks
or
months
taken
up
in
the
mere
act
of
signature
the
burdens
of
life
are
heavy
enough
without
putting
upon
any
one
the
extra
weight
of
too
much
nomenclature
it
is
a
sad
thing
when
an
infant
has
two
bachelor
uncles
both
rich
and
with
outrageous
names
for
the
baby
will
have
to
take
both
titles
and
that
is
enough
to
make
a
case
of
infant
mortality
quizzle
you
seem
to
me
governor
to
be
more
sprightly
at
every
interview
well
that
is
so
but
i
do
not
know
often
go
the
quickest
there
is
a
constant
sympathy
expressed
by
robust
people
for
those
of
slight
physical
constitution
i
think
the
sympathy
ought
to
turn
in
the
opposite
direction
it
is
the
delicate
people
who
escape
the
most
fearful
disorders
and
in
three
cases
out
of
four
live
the
longest
these
gigantic
structures
are
almost
always
reckless
of
health
they
say
nothing
hurts
me
and
so
they
stand
in
draughts
and
go
out
into
the
night
air
to
cool
off
and
eat
crabs
at
midnight
and
doff
their
flannels
in
april
a
time
would
be
experienced
by
the
most
disinterested
for
a
few
moments
in
the
contemplation
of
his
own
happy
success
he
forgot
the
sacrifice
at
which
he
was
about
to
obtain
it
such
is
human
nature
the
noblest
emotions
of
and
lose
their
individuality
in
his
but
ere
colonel
harwood
reached
the
alley
in
which
satchell
s
office
stood
his
thoughts
were
again
upon
his
daughter
and
more
than
once
his
step
faltered
and
he
half
turned
as
if
resolved
not
to
put
her
to
the
trial
but
when
he
reflected
how
all
else
depended
upon
it
and
that
it
must
be
done
he
moved
onward
again
as
he
came
into
the
alley
the
clock
of
the
old
south
struck
twelve
it
is
just
the
hour
i
appointed
to
meet
him
he
exclaimed
hastening
up
the
alley
his
heart
throbbing
with
mingled
hope
and
fear
as
the
probability
of
getting
or
not
getting
his
papers
rose
and
fell
in
his
agitated
mind
as
he
came
to
the
door
in
his
absence
of
mind
he
stepped
into
a
pool
of
soft
mud
and
water
which
was
directly
under
the
window
of
handy
the
boot
black
s
room
whether
handy
kept
that
particular
puddle
of
water
there
for
the
purpose
of
muddying
the
boots
was
a
great
thoroughfare
and
thus
get
custom
is
a
question
that
we
will
not
answer
as
we
do
not
wish
to
record
any
thing
against
handy
that
would
lessen
the
consideration
the
discriminating
reader
may
have
already
entertained
for
him
the
fact
is
however
that
every
day
during
the
dryest
weather
particularly
this
little
dirty
puddle
was
there
and
upon
an
average
seven
gentlemen
per
diem
irretrievably
soiled
their
boots
therein
and
handy
being
at
home
after
the
example
of
surgeons
who
are
ever
ready
at
hand
when
side
walks
are
slippery
got
the
polishing
of
them
this
little
pond
was
a
source
of
great
revenue
to
handy
much
more
so
indeed
than
the
frog
pond
ever
promises
to
be
to
the
corporation
massa
you
hab
muddy
you

cried
handy
to
colonel
harwood
and
springing
forward
with
his
brush
in
his
hand
the
sable
african
caught
the
colonel
by
the
ancle
and
held
him
fast
while
he
began
to
rub
his
boot
with
the
most
no
mood
at
such
a
time
to
be
detained
so
unceremoniously
overthrowing
the
astonished
handy
with
a
thrust
of
his
foot
he
hastened
into
the
entry
and
up
the
tottering
stair
way
to
satchell
s
office
that
am

picking
himself
up
and
then

in
a

said
kaleb
the
cobler
who
sat
with
his
door
open
upon
his
bench
hammering
out
a
piece
of
sole
leather
upon
his
lap
stone
if
i

in

upon

chapter
xv
the
surrender
of
the
papers
satchell
was
in
his
dingy
office
seated
at
his
table
in
the
armchair
when
a
rap
at
his
door
caused
him
to
lay
down
several
papers
which
he
was
examining
and
look
at
his
watch
it
is
two
minutes
past
twelve
he
mumbled
it
must
be
harwood
he
rose
and
proceeded
to
the
door
of
his
office
and
let
in
colonel
harwood
glad
to
see
you
my
dear
sir
from
your
looks
you
have
succeeded
with
your
daughter
my
niece
mr
satchell
cried
colonel
harwood
with
alarm
do
not
forget
yourself
again
i
did
forget
be
seated
sir
he
added
as
he
re
locked
his
door
colonel
harwood
bowed
and
remained
standing
for
his
former
experience
had
told
him
that
satchell
s
chairs
were
not
to
be
trusted
i
have
seen
my
niece
sir
observed
the
colonel
his
voice
agitated
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
control
its
tremulous
cadences
and
what
said
she
did
you
make
known
to
her
that
your
life
and
honor
were
in
her
hands
demanded
satchell
with
a
keen
observing
glance
from
his
brow
shadowed
eyes
yes
sir
i
made
known
to
her
so
much
of
the
facts
as
was
necessary
and
as
i
had
promised
you
i
would
do
and
she
said
what
that
me
sacrifice
was
that
her
word
to
speak
frankly
with
you
it
was
very
well
i
like
her
no
less
no
doubt
she
will
look
upon
it
as
a
sacrifice
to
marry
an
elderly
middle
aged
gentleman
like
myself
i
am
very
glad
she
thinks
it
will
be
a
sacrifice
you
are
yes
sir
i
am
pleased
with
her
remark
but
i
am
surprised
at
her
readiness
if
you
had
been
present
sir
at
our
trying
interview
you
would
not
have
termed
it
readiness
i
thought
at
one
moment
she
would
have
spurned
me
with
scorn
and
indignation
yes
she
is
a
spirited
girl
that
is
clear
from
her
eyes
so
she
was
reluctant
at
first
no
person
could
have
been
more
so
but
she
finally
yielded
that
i
can
not
will
not
say
i
performed
faithfully
my
part
i
have
now
come
yours
one
question
more
do
you
think
she
will
consent
to
marry
me
i
do
not
know
hoisted
the
stars
and
stripes
over
her
bloody
decks
may
saw
this
act
for
she
had
hid
her
eyes
from
the
scene
and
closed
her
ears
to
the
roar
of
the
battle
though
she
lingered
on
the
cliff
too
anxious
for
the
fate
of
her
lover
to
tear
herself
away
but
when
she
saw
him
leap
first
of
all
on
the
enemy
s
deck
from
the
canoe
and
perform
this
gallant
act
she
felt
her
heart
bound
with
joy
and
pride
and
gratitude
for
his
safety
the
sun
was
just
setting
when
the
frigate
struck
the
prisoners
were
transferred
to
the
yankee
frigate
the
same
night
among
them
were
the
english
captain
and
the
young
officer
with
the
star
upon
his
breast
the
latter
being
wounded
remained
on
board
the
american
frigate
that
night
for
he
had
an
important
interview
to
hold
with
the
cap
tain
touching
the
papers
he
had
discovered
for
he
needed
the
advice
of
some
intelligent
person
and
the
captain
having
shown
himself
to
be
his
friend
he
laid
the
whole
matter
before
him
in
the
cabin
when
the
american
had
read
the
papers
he
sent
for
the
english
captain
to
come
into
the
cabin
do
you
know
sir
any
thing
of
the
family
of
the
earl
of
northford
in
england
it
is
one
of
the
oldest
peerages
of
the
realm
do
you
know
any
thing
peculiar
in
the
history
of
this
family
the
last
earl
was
convicted
of
being
treasonably
in
league
with
napoleon
and
it
was
proved
against
him
that
he
had
offered
facilities
on
the
coast
of
his
own
estates
for
a
landing
of
the
french
invader
this
is
notorious
and
he
lost
his
title
and
estates
and
was
exiled
yes
but
he
had
a
daughter
of
the
queen
but
when
this
daughter
sent
for
to
be
placed
under
the
guardianship
of
the
crown
she
was
no
where
to
be
found
and
there
is
no
question
but
what
he
took
his
child
with
him
he
did
that
child
and
her
father
are
within
half
a
mile
of
us
read
those
papers
they
were
confirmatory
documents
sufficiently
clear
and
undisputable
to
establish
may
fawn
s
claim
to
the
title
of
countess
of
northford
william
northrop
and
his
daughter
were
sent
for
and
brought
on
board
he
after
making
a
fierce
resistance
when
he
saw
white
teeth
in
the
cabin
and
his
tin
case
and
papers
laying
before
the
captain
he
understood
all
that
had
transpired
the
english
captain
also
recognised
him
at
once
as
the
tratorous
earl
of
northford
he
confessed
the
fact
and
said
that
his
love
for
his
child
led
him
to
take
her
with
him
and
keep
the
secret
of
her
birth
from
her
but
he
had
drawn
up
writings
and
placed
them
in
the
tin
she
might
come
into
the
possession
of
her
rights
the
beauty
and
grace
of
the
maiden
charmed
all
present
george
hunnewell
looked
most
unhappy
she
saw
it
and
understood
the
cause
if
i
am
to
sacrifice
my
heart
s
affections
to
a
coronet
she
said
firmly
and
smiling
as
she
took
his
hand
i
prefer
remaining
may
northrop
william
northrop
after
all
had
been
said
looked
rather
gratified
at
the
result
a
heavy
load
seemed
to
be
removed
from
his
mind
he
took
his
daughter
s
hand
and
placing
it
in
george
s
said
be
happy
my
child
if
this
will
make
you
so
i
suppose
you
will
now
go
to
england
and
forget
your
exiled
father
be
it
so
no
sir
if
i
am
such
as
it
appears
i
am
i
shall
cast
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
to
solicit
your
pardon
our
story
is
now
ended
george
hunnewell
and
may
were
married
that
very
evening
for
may
it
in
the
cabin
of
the
frigate
william
northrop
returned
to
his
cabin
while
may
with
her
happy
husband
sailed
for
boston
and
thence
embarked
for
england
where
her
claim
was
acknowledged
she
succeed
in
obtaining
her
father
s
pardon
on
condition
he
should
never
leave
her
estate
george
as
a
patriotic
american
felt
some
compunctions
in
being
an
english
earl
by
courtesy
but
after
the
peace
he
became
more
reconciled
for
his
beautiful
wife
s
sake
to
this
brilliant
change
in
his
life
tom
who
was
an
illegitimate
son
of
william
of
northford
shared
his
sister

happiness
and
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
the
grandeur
of
her
new
position

feel
proud
of
her

monthly
between
havana
and
the
southern
ports
of
the
union
it
was
a
long
narrow
craft
sharp
in
the
bows
and
very
low
in
the
water
with
masts
that
raked
like
a
pen
when
one
writes
it
she
was
a
saucy
visaged
looking
sea
dog
but
having
the
reputation
of
being
a
fast
sailer
which
reputation
she
did
not
belie
i
resolved
to
take
passage
in
her
in
preference
to
a
heavy
kennebec
lumber
brig
that
was
the
captain
until
after
i
got
on
board
my
passage
having
been
taken
at
the
counting
room
of
the
consignee
while
he
was
at
the
custom
house
after
i
had
settled
myself
in
the
state
room
assigned
me
which
the
mate
had
resigned
for
my
accommodation
the
white
hairs
of
m
intosh
the
bloody
face
of
chadbourne
rising
for
a
moment
and
then
sinking
to
shout
the
battle
cry
no
more
it
is
a
terrible
wall
of
bayonet
and
flame
which
brightens
and
burns
from
every
nook
of
the
chaparral
but
the
americans
are
not
to
be
turned
back
in
their
steady
course
every
regiment
is
doing
immortal
deeds
for
the
banner
the
third
the
fourth
the
fifth
the
eighth
they
are
all
there
in
the
ravine
among
the
bloody
lakes
and
up
the
deadly
bank
morris
and
allen
hays
and
woods
buchanan
and
barbour
lincoln
and
jourdan
you
may
see
them
in
every
part
of
the
scene
their
swords
rising
as
with
one
impulse
while
their
men
follow
them
into
the
very
jaws
of
death
and
suddenly
a
cloud
rolls
over
the
chaparral
and
like
shouts
from
the
bosom
of
the
cloud
hark
the
deadly
clang
of
bayonet
against
bayonet
the
death
cry
and
the
wild
hurrah
mingle
in
one
fiendish
chorus
men
are
dying
everywhere
you
see
their
ghastly
faces
in
the
waters
of
the
lagoon
spouting
blood
into
its
bloody
pool
beneath
the
silent
cannon
as
their
skulls
crushed
into
the
sod
you
hear
their
gurgling
cry
amid
the
thickets
of
the
chaparral
you
count
their
butchered
corses
sixteen
hundred
men
you
will
remember
are
doing
battle
with
nine
thousand
not
on
a
level
plain
as
yesterday
but
in
the
pass
of
a
dark
ravine
amid
the
assassin
ambuscades
of
a
tangled
chaparral
through
lakelets
knee
deep
yes
breast
high
every
wave
burdened
with
the
bodies
of
the
dead
in
a
whirlpool
of
carnage
like
this
it
is
difficult
to
forget
the
roar
the
smoke
the
blaze
and
gaze
calmly
upon
the
individual
deeds
of
chivalry
and
murder
yet
dipping
our
pencil
in
the
blood
the
glare
of
battle
we
will
crouch
here
in
the
chaparral
and
try
to
paint
them
all
taylor
is
on
his
horse
too
near
the
ravine
his
face
lights
every
instant
by
the
glare
the
sod
every
moment
dashing
against
the
flanks
of
the
old
grey
as
the
cannon
balls
plough
the
grass
into
furrows
the
soldiers
beg
the
old
man
not
to
peril
his
life
the
officers
surround
him
and
would
turn
his
steed
aside
from
the
fury
of
the
battle
what
is
it
the
old
man
says
look
there
with
a
quiet
wave
of
his
sword
and
toward
the
right
a
battalion
of
americans
on
the
borders
of
the
ravine
not
two
hundred
strong
are
threatened
by
a
solid
mass
of
horse
and
foot
who
come
thundering
over
the
pass
beautifully
they
rush
to
battle
their
lances
fluttering
with
crimson
flags
their
sharp
steel
glittering
in
deadly
lines
it
is
a
terrible
sight
and
the
american
battalion
quivers
with
a
tremulous
impulse
for
a
contest
with
such
an
overwhelming
force
can
not
be
called
a
fight
it
is
a
murder
a
massacre
look
there
says
the
old
man
zachary
and
bounding
from
the
encircling
officers
he
spurs
his
grey
steed
forward
and
in
a
moment
plunges
into
the
centre
of
the
battalion
s
square
i
am
here
in
the
centre
of
your
square
that
old
man
on
his
grey
horse
with
his
form
covered
with
a
plain
brown
coat
presents
a
sight
at
once
heroic
and
sublime
around
him
two
hundred
bayonets
yonder
not
thirty
yards
in
front
the
advancing
mass
of
mexicans
horse
and
foot
at
least
one
thousand
strong
i
am
here
in
the
centre
of
the
square
he
says
and
every
foot
is
rooted
to
the
sod
no
other
words
are
needed
silently
they
receive
the
terror
of
the
mexican
charge
bayonet
to
bayonet
the
breast
of
man
as
they
come
up
the
bank
without
one
hurrah
but
that
fire
did
you
see
that
sudden
flash
light
up
the
entire
mexican
array
that
smoke
did
you
see
its
pall
gather
them
in
now
they
shout
now
plunging
down
the
bank
they
charge
the
mexicans
home
and
precipitate
the
silent
butchery
of
the
bayonet
upon
their
splendid
array
again
that
shout
the
mexicans
quiver
every
horse
recoiling
on
the
horse
behind
him
every
rank
falling
back
on
the
next
line
until
men
and
horses
whirl
together
like
a
thousand
waves
meeting
in
one
centre
not
a
moment
to
recover
themselves
not
a
pause
for
thought
again
that
wild
hurrah
old
zachary
left
alone
on
the
verge
of
the
bank
laughs
quietly
to
himself
as
he
sees
beneath
the
curtain
of
clouds
that
glorious
sight
the
mexican
array
shattered
in
its
centre
broken
on
each
wing
give
way
and
scatter
in
mad
disorder
along
some
painter
whose
heart
glows
into
his
canvass
at
the
memory
of
heroic
deeds
a
bluff
old
warrior
mounted
on
his
old
grey
steed
bending
forward
with
extended
hand
and
brightening
eye
as
gazing
into
the
shadows
of
the
ravine
below
he
sees
two
hundred
soldiers
burst
like
wounded
tigers
on
a
thousand
and
at
one
charge
level
their
solid
ranks
into
dust
beyond
the
ravine
the
battle
went
on
in
horrible
fury
a
picture
from
its
scenes
of
carnage
do
you
see
that
wall
of
darkening
chaparral
with
horses
and
men
appearing
at
every
interval
and
lances
shining
from
the
thorns
as
though
they
grew
there
it
lies
beyond
the
ravine
beyond
the
silenced
batteries
at
the
head
of
the
fifth
regiment
a
white
haired
man
with
his
bared
arm
grasping
a
sharp
sword
spurs
the
roan
war
horse
and
plunges
into
the
ravine
he
is
the
first
of
the
band
beautiful
and
bright
the
bayonets
of
his
regiment
sparkle
a
murderous
fire
rushes
into
his
face
it
shrieks
away
over
the
regiment
but
he
is
gone
from
the
eyes
of
his
men
gone
through
the
chaparral
into
covert
not
ten
yards
square
the
instant
he
plunges
into
the
shadow
he
feels
his
horse
the
noble
roan
quiver
and
with
a
howl
he
goes
down
springing
from
beneath
his
dead
horse
the
solitary
warrior
darts
to
his
feet
and
finds
red
lightning
sent
courier
throughout
the
civilized
earth
and
tho
ships
do
not
yet
sail
in
the
blue
ether
above
us
and
though
tyranny
still
exists
and
liberty
is
not
every
where
triumphant
yet
we
must
remember
the
prediction
was
made
for
the
nineteenth
century
of
which
more
than
half
is
yet
to
appear
and
we
little
know
what
is
written
in
the
yet
unopened
book
of
time
well
may
we
of
the
present
day
exclaim
in
the
language
of
scripture
what
shall
be
the
end
of
these
things
and
what
the
sign
of
their
coming
in
the
opening
chapter
of
this
history
we
presented
a
contrast
between
the
ancient
and
modern
appearance
of
columbia
which
in
itself
has
altered
less
perhaps
than
in
the
improvements
that
environ
it
in
place
of
the
rough
and
serpentine
horse
path
that
connected
it
with
its
sister
village
cincinnati
with
here
and
there
a
solitary
traveler
upon
it
we
have
now
a
broad
smooth
and
beautiful
turnpike
shooting
away
from
since
sprung
into
existence
and
winding
round
the
base
of
bald
hill
at
a
height
sufficient
to
overlook
the
quiet
dwellings
reposing
below
as
also
the
broad
plain
so
often
mentioned
over
which
roll
teams
of
burden
stages
and
omnibuses
for
travelers
and
citizens
and
carriages
for
pleasure
while
along
its
side
can
be
traced
the
dark
lines
of
a
railway
on
which
to
and
fro
rush
the
iron
horses
with
great
velocity
dragging
their
weighty
burdens
over
three
hundred
miles
of
territory
and
connecting
this
point
with
the
great
lakes
of
the
north
by
a
journey
of
only
a
few
hours
at
the
precise
spot
where
the
turnpike
winding
around
the
base
of
bald
hill
takes
a
more
northern
course
you
have
a
delightful
view
of
the
little
knoll
so
frequently
mentioned
in
these
pages
as
the
ground
on
which
stood
the
first
building
erected
solely
to
the
worship
of
god
by
the
pioneers
of
the
miami
valley
this
knoll
is
only
a
few
yards
from
the
base
of
the
hill
on
which
arrest
the
gaze
of
the
observant
traveler
in
appearance
it
much
resembles
an
indian
mound
being
somewhat
oval
and
smooth
no
building
now
adorns
its
summit
but
the
ruins
of
one
can
there
be
seen
around
which
covered
with
green
sward
are
scattered
the
graves
of
many
who
worshiped
within
its
walls
in
times
gone
by
whose
names
half
obliterated
from
the
crumbling
stones
above
them
speak
the
vanity
and
decay
of
earthly
things
and
the
dirge
to
whose
memories
is
now
only
sung
by
the
wailing
wind
as
it
sighs
through
the
branches
of
the
willow
the
beach
and
the
locust
waving
above
and
shadowing
their
last
remains
to
this
knoll
then
not
as
it
appears
now
but
as
it
appeared
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
with
its
neat
but
humble
building
of
worship
peeping
through
the
grove
that
covered
it
we
must
once
more
call
the
readers
attention
and
if
he
like
he
may
stand
and
view
it
from
the
self
same
spot
were
then
in
their
rosy
prime
of
life
it
was
a
beautiful
sabbath
morning
in
the
spring
of
all
nature
seemed
rejoicing
and
full
of
happiness
the
icy
hand
of
winter
had
been
lifted
from
the
seemingly
desolate
earth
and
everything
appeared
as
joyous
as
on
the
departure
of
a
tyrannical
ruler
the
trees
had
put
or
were
putting
forth
their
buds
their
blossoms
and
leaves
and
checkering
the
forest
with
that
beautiful
variety
of
color
which
renders
it
so
enchanting
while
the
earth
had
sent
up
her
blade
and
her
flowers
of
all
hues
until
her
surface
seemed
a
carpet
too
rich
almost
to
be
pressed
by
the
foot
of
man
the
warblers
of
the
forest
had
already
returned
from
their
journey
to
the
sunny
south
and
now
thronged
the
trees
and
made
earth
vocal
with
their
melody
already
had
the
husbandman
put
his
seed
into
the
teeming
earth
and
the
result
was
now
visible
in
broad
green
squares
of
corn
and
wheat
destined
by
the
process
the
golden
harvest
of
plenty
we
have
said
it
was
a
beautiful
sabbath
morning
the
sun
slowly
ascending
to
the
zenith
of
his
glory
rolled
over
an
ocean
of
ethereal
blue
wherein
not
a
cloud
floated
to
mar
its
beauty
or
check
for
an
instant
his
warmth
or
cast
a
single
shadow
over
the
scene
before
us
a
gentle
southern
breeze
swept
down
the
hills
of
old
kentucky
rippled
the
bosom
of
the
ohio
and
came
up
the
valley
freighted
with
the
sweets
of
a
thousand
flowers
bearing
to
the
ear
the
hum
of
ten
thousand
insects
and
the
songs
of
a
thousand
warblers
save
these
all
sounds
were
hushed
it
was
sabbath
the
day
set
apart
by
him
who
made
the
world
for
rest
and
the
weekly
toil
of
the
husbandman
had
ceased
toward
the
little
sanctuary
so
often
mentioned
a
long
line
of
villagers
male
and
female
were
taking
their
way
dressed
in
the
simple
costume
of
the
time
with
no
ostentatious
display
of
fashion
no
solemn
bell
was
sending
its
vibrations
upon
the
balmy
air
to
call
them
to
the
church
of
god
they
knew
it
was
the
hour
bordering
upon
worship
and
they
set
forth
from
their
peaceful
dwelling
places
accordingly
among
them
were
all
classes
from
the
youth
to
the
grey
beard
from
the
maidon
of
a
few
summers
to
the
hoary
matron
whose
feet
already
pressed
the
verge
of
the
grave
some
were
grave
and
some
were
gay
for
all
of
course
did
not
feel
the
solemnity
of
the
day
yet
none
behaved
with
indecorum
in
the
front
and
rear
of
the
church
were
stationed
sentinels
with
their
rifles
upon
their
shoulders
past
which
the
male
portion
of
the
villagers
bore
their
own
arms
and
ascending
the
little
knoll
disappeared
one
after
another
within
the
rude
walls
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
the
most
high
around
the
door
of
the
church
however
a
small
group
of
youths
and
was
left
our
race
when
they
were
driven
from
the
golden
gates
of
happy
paradise
and
in
leila
s
heart
lived
in
all
its
strength
and
purity
such
love
wonder
not
then
and
call
them
not
idle
fears
which
so
overpowered
her
and
crushed
for
the
moment
her
senses
she
made
a
violent
effort
to
be
composed
and
such
was
the
force
of
her
strong
will
which
had
been
expanded
and
strengthened
and
spoke
to
her
husband
in
a
quiet
even
tone
but
now
he
too
felt
as
if
his
life
were
gone
the
fear
of
his
wife
had
in
a
moment
changed
all
and
he
saw
at
once
that
charles
was
right
that
there
was
no
reason
yet
to
dismiss
fear
red
hand
would
in
his
cunning
have
done
this
secretly
if
he
did
it
at
all
that
he
might
get
a
sufficient
start
to
baffle
his
pursuers
he
saw
it
all
in
an
instant
both
kept
silent
awaiting
with
breathless
interest
the
return
of
charles
they
strained
their
eyes
in
the
direction
where
they
supposed
he
would
appear
as
if
they
by
so
doing
could
pierce
through
the
thick
overshadowing
foliage
that
formed
an
impenetrable
hiding
place
the
eye
could
not
reach
they
had
but
a
few
minutes
to
wait
however
though
it
seemed
like
so
many
hours
to
their
brooding
minds
racked
with
torturing
suspense
leila
uttered
a
wild
heart
rending
scream
as
she
saw
him
emerge
fears
returned
again
her
cheek
lost
its
color
her
heart
almost
ceased
to
beat
it
beat
but
slowly
feebly
sending
back
the
blood
that
hurried
to
it
in
fright
he
approached
they
saw
he
held
in
his
hand
a
piece
of
the
silk
scarf
she
had
worn
when
she
left
the
lodge
which
had
been
a
gift
from
himself
but
a
few
days
before
it
was
torn
as
if
by
violent
hands
near
the
centre
and
he
had
found
it
on
the
ground
at
the
entrance
of
her
little
arbor
there
were
other
marks
he
said
around
the
spot
which
too
clearly
too
surely
showed
that
his
dear
coquese
had
been
torn
from
her
home
by
the
cruel
bloody
red
hand
he
spoke
in
a
voice
choked
with
feeling
and
wretchedness
and
his
agony
of
feeling
which
was
so
startlingly
portrayed
in
his
face
and
which
would
burst
forth
in
his
heart
rending
words
and
deep
sighs
so
deeply
moved
the
pity
of
leila
that
for
a
moment
so
utterly
crushed
and
blighted
were
his
cherished
fairest
hopes
that
no
tongue
can
speak
the
grief
he
felt
at
the
fate
of
his
dear
dear
girl
such
a
fate
so
cruel
so
utterly
and
completely
miserable
and
wretched
must
it
make
her
and
then
she
must
live
on
to
die
by
inches
till
her
crushed
and
bleeding
heart
should
cease
to
move
and
lay
cold
in
death
a
death
welcome
to
her
in
the
spring
time
of
life
as
the
only
means
of
delivering
her
from
a
greater
woe
such
were
the
thoughts
that
burnt
in
charles
soul
and
in
broken
and
agonized
sentences
found
vent
in
his
words
that
seemed
to
tear
and
rend
his
heart
with
their
utterance
but
his
violent
grief
was
not
long
permitted
to
hold
sway
over
him
in
this
terrible
manner
le
beaux
had
during
his
absence
joined
m
boileau
and
his
wife
and
by
his
calmness
and
kind
words
had
done
much
towards
calming
her
fears
and
restoring
her
to
herself
and
upon
charles
and
see
the
grief
that
crushed
and
weighed
him
down
or
that
tortured
him
to
agony
without
feeling
that
his
great
sorrow
was
more
than
all
their
own
however
much
they
suffered
and
deserved
their
sympathy
and
for
this
end
le
beaux
now
advanced
and
sat
down
by
his
side
he
had
to
turn
away
and
brush
the
tears
from
eyes
that
were
not
apt
to
weep
so
profound
so
touching
was
his
young
and
adored
friend
s
sorrow
but
he
whispered
to
him
now
that
there
was
hope
that
there
was
vengeance
to
be
taken
on
the
cruel
foe
due
to
coquese
and
to
himself
that
they
might
yet
overtake
him
and
rescue
her
from
his
fiendish
grasp
charles
did
not
at
first
appear
to
understand
him
but
le
beaux
repeated
it
again
as
he
did
so
charles
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
catching
his
meaning
his
eye
kindled
into
a
blaze
his
face
changed
to
one
complete
absorbing
expression
of
determined
resolution
and
in
a
resolute
tone
you
are
right
le
beaux
it
is
idle
to
sit
here
and
indulge
our
grief
we
can
we
must
i
feel
we
shall
yet
overtake
the
villain
and
his
face
glowing
his
arm
raised
on
high
he
bound
himself
by
an
oath
to
follow
him
so
long
as
they
lived
or
until
he
should
rescue
his
betrothed
or
if
dead
slay
her
destroyer
quick
quick
let
us
mount
our
horses
and
pursue
them
calm
yourself
said
le
beaux
and
let
all
the
chiefs
deliberate
what
measures
to
pursue
and
then
we
will
lose
no
time
in
carrying
them
into
action
see
you
that
the
warriors
are
yet
drawn
up
in
the
village
ready
to
do
battle
for
coquese
whom
they
all
love
m
boileau
spoke
to
his
wife
a
few
soothing
words
and
led
her
into
the
lodge
he
told
her
he
would
soon
return
to
her
he
must
now
go
to
the
council
and
stood
chapter
xv
the
delawares
who
had
been
attentive
observers
of
all
that
had
transpired
at
m
boileau
s
lodge
and
whose
attachment
to
him
and
his
family
was
of
a
strong
and
most
endearing
nature
were
prepared
to
receive
the
intelligence
which
was
now
made
known
to
them
by
the
distressed
and
suffering
father
m
boileau
he
had
so
far
learned
and
adopted
the
indian
customs
as
to
be
able
to
control
and
conceal
even
the
most
violent
feelings
which
might
possess
and
agitate
him
as
he
now
stood
up
before
them
and
thousands
now
by
the
lake
shore
now
the
desert
woods
he
talked
to
them
as
much
with
his
radiant
forehead
and
calm
deep
eyes
as
with
his
voice
and
he
always
ended
his
teachings
with
a
word
like
this
god
is
our
father
and
all
men
are
his
children
i
might
spend
the
hours
of
this
silent
night
in
telling
you
how
this
son
of
the
carpenter
dwelt
with
the
poor
shared
the
crust
of
the
poor
wept
with
the
poor
lived
for
the
poor
and
died
for
the
poor
as
for
the
rich
man
whether
he
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
priest
or
as
a
king
the
son
of
the
carpenter
only
spoke
of
him
with
pity
with
reproach
with
scorn
his
mission
was
to
the
poor
and
without
arms
without
priests
clad
only
in
his
humble
garb
he
spoke
to
the
poor
of
his
native
land
and
his
voice
moved
the
earth
like
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
of
god
he
died
at
last
after
a
need
not
tell
you
how
what
death
is
reserved
for
those
who
endeavor
with
a
single
heart
to
do
good
to
man
not
the
death
of
the
pampered
priest
who
reclining
on
silken
couches
embosomed
in
the
chambers
of
a
palace
looks
with
sorrow
too
deep
for
tears
upon
the
rich
viands
and
the
genial
wines
which
he
can
not
take
with
him
to
the
grave
not
the
death
of
the
conqueror
who
makes
himself
a
couch
of
the
bodies
of
the
slain
and
expires
most
royally
a
tiger
clad
in
glossy
fur
crouching
upon
his
victims
and
tearing
them
with
his
fangs
as
he
dies
no
but
the
death
of
the
felon
nailed
to
an
abhorred
tree
which
towered
alone
and
hideous
upon
the
height
of
a
craggy
steep
with
the
black
sky
above
it
and
the
dark
mass
of
countless
spectators
around
and
beneath
it
this
was
the
death
of
the
son
of
the
carpenter
who
had
said
to
man
that
priests
or
kings
nor
in
churches
or
costly
ceremonial
but
mark
the
simplicity
of
the
carpenter
s
son
in
loving
one
another
o
that
i
could
paint
to
you
the
radiant
forehead
and
earnest
eyes
of
this
carpenter
s
son
and
show
him
to
you
as
he
lived
among
men
their
brother
clad
like
themselves
their
friend
for
he
said
to
them
god
is
our
father
but
he
has
been
dead
many
centuries
behold
him
not
as
he
walked
the
sands
of
his
native
land
but
as
he
is
he
swept
the
cloak
aside
which
enveloped
the
limbs
of
the
unknown
the
cavern
echoed
with
a
cry
of
amazement
and
terror
for
there
very
near
the
light
towered
the
leaden
image
whose
forehead
stamped
with
despair
and
motionless
eyes
full
of
unutterable
anguish
and
form
clad
in
the
garments
of
toil
seemed
to
imprison
a
living
soul
it
was
the
image
of
the
imprisoned
jesus
this
and
beautiful
spirit
of
the
carpenter
s
son
they
have
robbed
man
of
his
brother
his
friend
they
have
coffined
the
soul
of
the
mechanic
in
the
creed
and
ritual
of
their
church
they
have
taken
to
themselves
that
man
of
nazareth
who
never
spoke
of
priest
or
king
but
with
pity
reproach
or
scorn
brothers
be
it
our
task
to
take
this
son
of
the
carpenter
to
separate
his
loving
spirit
from
church
and
creed
and
lift
him
once
more
before
the
eyes
of
millions
not
as
the
incarnation
of
a
church
or
the
imprisoned
christ
of
a
ferocious
superstition
but
as
the
carpenter
s
son
who
first
embodied
the
truth
of
brotherhood
and
made
it
blossom
in
the
hearts
of
men
with
these
three
words
the
carpenter
s
son
we
can
regenerate
the
world
we
will
go
to
the
poor
we
will
ask
them
not
to
believe
in
the
trinity
or
in
the
unity
of
god
nor
in
catholic
mahommed
we
will
not
waste
time
in
comparing
speculations
or
analyzing
creeds
armed
with
this
christ
of
the
poor
we
will
say
to
the
poor
he
was
a
poor
man
such
as
you
are
like
you
he
toiled
like
you
he
hungered
at
the
graves
of
poor
men
like
you
he
wept
he
lived
for
you
for
you
he
died
then
listen
to
his
voice
which
utters
all
truth
in
simple
words
love
one
another
the
peasant
whose
animated
features
contrasted
with
the
motionless
lineaments
of
the
image
by
his
side
now
glanced
around
from
face
to
face
speaking
by
turns
to
every
one
of
the
brothers
as
he
spoke
his
voice
became
tremulous
his
sunburnt
features
were
wet
with
tears
and
can
we
not
accomplish
the
great
work
for
man
is
there
a
brother
here
who
can
say
no
who
has
the
heart
to
say
it
here
we
are
men
of
all
nations
colors
and
creeds
can
we
it
were
an
altar
and
sacrifice
our
prejudices
our
creeds
at
the
feet
of
the
carpenter
s
son
mahommedan
i
speak
to
you
in
your
traditions
you
have
read
of
jesus
the
prophet
do
you
object
to
jesus
the
carpenter
s
son
hindoo
your
traditions
speak
of
a
mysterious
incarnation
of
a
sublime
manifestation
of
god
enshrined
in
the
flesh
can
you
refuse
to
acknowledge
and
love
the
spirit
of
god
enshrined
in
the
form
of
a
carpenter
s
son
protestant
it
is
your
boast
to
read
the
written
word
of
god
can
you
refuse
the
carpenter
s
son
catholic
your
traditions
speak
of
church
of
authority
of
popes
invested
with
god
like
power
and
men
sunk
beneath
the
degradation
of
the
brute
creation
and
yet
amid
this
horrible
mass
of
error
there
is
here
and
there
a
word
a
true
word
of
the
carpenter
s
son
are
you
willing
to
sacrifice
church
authority
pope
and
council
at
the
alter
of
deist
it
is
to
you
i
appeal
it
is
your
delight
to
cherish
the
idea
of
one
supreme
god
only
revealed
to
man
by
the
forms
of
external
nature
do
you

got
about
five
hundred
kinds
of

look
ancient
enuff

who

world
ai
nt
fit
to
live
in
cause
it
ai
nt
as
old
and
musty
as
london
by
the
time
i
got
down
to
gadsby
s
i
was
pretty
tired
and
after
eatin
a
fust
rate
dinner
i
got
reddy
to
go
to
baltimore
i
paid
my
bill
which
was
very
little
i
thought
for
sich
comfortable
livin
and
got
my
trunks
all
packed
and
reddy
sum
time
before
the
cars
started
bimeby
long
cum
the
omnibus
and
tuck
my
trunks
but
the
depo
was
so
close
that
i
jest
fit
my
way
through
the
hack
drivers
to
the
cars
without
any
serious
accidents
it
was
a
very
plesant
afternoon
and
ther
was
ever
so
many
ladys
and
gentlemen
in
the
cars
gwine
to
baltimore
and
among
em
sum
of
the
most
outlandish
specimens
of
human
nater
i
ever
met
with
i
thought
i
d
seed
whiskers
and
bustles
before
but
i
find
the
further
north
i
git
the
bigger
they
we
went
the
houses
capitol
and
all
waltzin
round
behind
us
til
we
was
out
of
sight
of
the
city
and
the
posts
of
professor
morse
s
telegraph
as
they
call
it
gettin
closer
and
closer
together
the
faster
we
went
but
now
the
scene
is
very
different
from
what
it
is
on
the
carolina
or
even
the
virginy
rodes
the
woods
is
in
little
patches
and
the
fields
is
smaller
and
the
houses
and
towns
is
thicker
the
country
is
more
uneven
and
evry
mile
changes
the
scenery
and
gives
one
sumthing
new
to
look
at
the
track
too
is
even
as
a
die
and
the
cars
go
like
lightnin
and
as
easy
as
a
rockinchair
one
minit
we
was
whirlin
along
between
butiful
farms
in
the
next
we
darted
into
a
cut
whar
the
banks
shut
out
the
view
and
perhaps
the
next
we
was
crossin
over
sum
butiful
valley
on
a
bridge
with
mills
and
houses
and
people
far
below
us
we
passed
em
would
twist
up
ther
tails
and
giv
us
a
race
but
we
went
so
fast
that
nothin
could
nt
keep
up
with
us
but
the
wire
lightnin
conductors
of
the
telegraph
which
kep
us
cumpany
all
the
way
it
s
only
bout
forty
miles
from
washington
to
baltimore
and
i
had
nt
begun
to
git
tired
before
the
monuments
and
steeples
and
towers
of
the
city
begun
to
show
themselves
in
the
distance
gittin
nearer
and
nearer
til
we
was
rite
in
among
em
when
we
got
to
the
depo
in
the
edge
of
the
city
they
unhitched
the
lokymotive
and
hitched
on
sum
hoses
that
pulled
us
away
down
into
the
center
of
the
city
to
the
railrode
office
i
could
find
enuff
for
twenty
pair
of
eyes
to
do
lookin
at
this
butiful
city
i
had
nt
no
idee
it
was
half
so
large
or
half
so
handsum
but
i
had
no
time
to
give
it
more
n
a
glimpse
before
we
was
at
the
shoppin
place
and
in
the
middle
of
another
regiment
me
to
go
this
way
and
other
til
i
did
nt
hardly
know
which
eend

he
went
to
look
out
for
my
baggage
while

was
waitin
for

a
reinforcement
of
hackmen
got
round
me
and
insisted
on

the
exchange
well
i
was
like

at
the
dore
of
a
grate

stone
house
with
a
dome

like

at

after

office

big
book
out
before

and
gin
me

so
i
put

had
nt
more
n
finished

cum
the

with

trunks
and
in
a
minit
after
i
found
myself
up

in
no
whar

now
writin
to
you
and
whar
i
expect
to
remain
for
a
day
or
two
i
mean
to
go
to
bed
early
to
night
and
take
a
fresh
start
in
the
mornin
to
look

so
no
more
from
viii
may
to
mr
thompson
dear
sir
i
waked
up
this
mornin
bright
and
early
but
i
felt
so
monstrous
tired
that
i
did
nt
git
you
are
mistaken
in
me
replied
great
medicine
if
you
suppose
i
will
aid
your
base
ends
i
would
not
kill
that
innocent
little
creature
to
own
the
world
by
replied
the
other
making
use
of
an
oath
and
you
an
indian
and
say
this
what
in
the
name
of
ails
the
child
that
all
fear
to
harm
her
she
must
die
though
and
if
you
will
not
undertake
the
job
why
then
there
is
no
other
head
stay
cried
the
old
man
beseechingly
i
will
not
harm
her
myself
but
if
you
wish
to
rid
yourself
of
her
i
will
consent
to
place
her
far
from
civilization
and
adopt
her
into
my
tribe
but
she
is
a
child
of
consequence
pursued
the
other
the
daughter
of
one
who
is
a
great
chief
in
his
own
country
and
stands
between
me
and
fortune
should
she
return
there
is
no
likelihood
of
that
interrupted
the
other
as
i
shall
take
her
some
hundreds
of
miles
into
the
wilderness
but
her
father
who
knows
nothing
of
my
design
and
to
whom
i
must
report
her
lost
or
dead
may
institute
search
how
do
i
know
she
may
not
be
found
that
i
think
impossible
rejoined
the
old
man
but
this
will
make
all
sure
continued
the
dark
stranger
again
pointing
the
pistol
at
her
head
nay
hold
to
murder
her
i
will
make
her
spirit
haunt
you
forever
you
make
her
spirit
haunt
me
umph
what
are
you
but
a
deerepid
old
indian
by
heavens
i
have
a
mind
to
murder

but
i
hate
murder
for
in
fact
one
never
feels
safe
afterward
do
you
believe
in
a
god
old
man
for
you
talk
as
one
the
world
denominates

i
do
believe
in
a
god

if
you
dare
to
harm
this
child
his
just
retribution
shall
follow
you
even
to

remotest
bounds
of
earth
and
time
the
other
paused
reflected
and
then
added
i
would
not
have
her
blood
upon
my
soul
for
i
have
sin
enough
there
already
you
think
there
is
no
danger
of
her
being
discovered
not
the
least
and
you
say
you
believe
in
a
god
i
do
you
hope
for
salvation
as
then
swear
by
your
hopes
of
salvation
to
keep
her
among
the
indians
as
long
as
you
live
to
adopt
her
into
your
tribe
and
never
to
mortal
ear
to
reveal
a
word
concerning
this
interview
or
how
she
came
in
your
possession
that
you
will
never
attempt
to
trace
out
her
parentage
nor
make
any
inquiries
concerning
her
swear
this
and
she
is
yours
refuse
and
her
death
and
yours
is
the
penalty
i
swear
to
all
answered
great
medicine
enough
take
her
and
speed
thee
to
the
wilderness
while
i
will
away
and
report
her
dead
murdered
by
the
indians
he
added
with
a
grim
smile
then
leaping
upon
his
horse
he
muttered
as
he
turned
away
all
is
safe
i
think
for
we
shall
soon
be
over
the
water
and
the
next
moment
both
horse
and
rider
were
lost
in
the
forest
this
child
writes
great
medicine
behold
in
yourself
your
early
history
strange
said
madam
mortimer
musingly
here
is
more
mystery
i
do
not
understand
it
who
could
have
been
this
horseman
and
what
the
meaning
of
his
words
as
you
were
stolen
away
on
the
night
succeeding
my
desertion
by
your
father
i
had
ever
supposed
or
hoped
rather
you
had
been
taken
away
by
him
and
with
him
wherever
he
went
and
this
hope
proved
my
only
comfort
in
affliction
but
now
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
this
horseman
could
not
have
been
your
father
for
the
description
is
not
at
all
like
him
the
latter
was
tall
dark
complexioned
it
is
true
but
with
fine
features
and
handsome
person
and
then
he
referred
to
your
father
as
knowing
nothing
of
this
dark
transaction
and
termed
him
a
great
chief
in
his
country
and
said
you
were
standing
between
him
and
fortune
what
could
he
have
meant
by
this
last
your
father
had
no
fortune
could
not
get
it
ha
a
thought
strikes
me
he
was
an
exile
from
his
native
land
though
for
what
he
would
never
tell
me
would
never
speak
of
his
early
history
it
is
possible
he
may
have
been
a
personage
of
consequence
banished
for
some
state
intrigue
and
again
restored
it
may
be
he
had
news
of
this
when
he
came
to
declare
his
intention
of
leaving
me
and
now
i
remember
he
once
intimated
that
he
would
some
day
be
independent
of
me
though
i
did
not
know
what
was
meant
this
must
be
it
she
continued
as
if
soliloquizing
this
must
be
it
and
this
stranger
some
fiend
in
human
form
plotting
to
succeed
him
in
wealth
and
station
oh
the
wickedness
of
all
mankind
but
i
forget
my
friends
you
do
not
know
of
what
i
speak
as
i
have
never
told
you
my
history
nay
madam
returned
i
we
know
more
lilian
blushed
and
i
became
embarrassed
for
i
felt
i
had
in
my
heedlessness
said
a
word
too
much
pardon
me
i
returned
and
do
not
blame
my
informant
i
must
own
i
have
heard
the
tale
before
but
you
will
not
regret
it
perhaps
when
i
say
that
to
this
very
knowledge
you
are
partially
if
not
entirely
indebted
for
the
presence
of
your
long
lost
daughter
i
blame
no
one
she
answered
solemnly
for
all
in
the
hands
of
god
has
worked
for
my
good
i
understand
it
all
she
added
glancing
at
lilian
and
eva
these
tell
tale
blushes
reveal
the
truth
eva
told
lilian
in
confidence
and
love
wrung
from
her
the
secret
i
am
glad
it
is
so
you
are
all
my
friends
and
the
tale
by
rights
belongs
to
you
i
might
never
have
told
it
myself
unless
on
an
occasion
like
this
idle
world
speculating
and
jesting
on
the
secrets
of
a
community
and
when
you
shall
have
learned
to
flatter
this
vanity
in
a
dexterous
manner
you
will
possess
one
of
the
requisites
of
the
merchant
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
natural
for
those
to
thrust
themselves
boldly
forward
at
the
beginning
presuming
we
are
ignorant
of
their
inability
to
pay
and
endeavor
to
obtain
credit
of
this
class
you
must
beware
and
keep
constantly
on
your
guard
mr
white
has
kindly
consented
to
furnish
me
with
information
which
will
be
of
service
he
has
given
me
the
names
of
most
of
the
good
men
for
ten
or
fifteen
miles
round
you
will
find
the
list
in
the
cash
drawer
you
can
easily
refer
to
it
when
people
are
looking
at
the
goods
without
any
one
perceiving
what
you
are
doing
and
when
you
find
any
one
present
in
the
good
list
it
will
not
be
difficult
for
you
to
intimate
to
him
in
a
low
tone
so
as
not
to
be
overheard
by
the
rest
that
you
will
be
happy
to
sell
him
whatever
he
may
need
on
a
credit
of
six
months
at
the
end
of
six
months
if
he
is
not
ready
to
pay
we
will
take
his
note
bearing
ten
is
the
legal
rate
in
missouri
we
must
sell
all
we
can
to
good
men
on
time
they
are
not
so
particular
about
the
prices
as
those
who
buy
for
cash
nevertheless
when
we
can
get
the
money
down
it
is
still
better
and
it
will
be
well
for
us
when
we
perceive
any
one
has
the
cash
about
him
to
endeavor
to
get
it
all
before
we
hint
anything
about
credit
very
well
i
replied
but
must
i
always
adhere
to
the
selling
prices
marked
on
the
goods
in
figures
i
was
just
about
to
speak
on
that
subject
said
he
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
business
to
manage
adroitly
it
is
better
learned
by
observation
than
by
verbal
directions
to
cash
buyers
the
prices
should
be
as
uniform
as
possible
and
only
varied
in
consideration
of
the
quantity
they
buy
in
regard
to
the
others
there
is
always
more
or
less
risk
the
good
man
to
day
may
be
ruined
by
some
unforeseen
mishap
to
morrow
but
there
are
certain
degrees
of
risk
between
which
you
must
learn
to
discriminate
for
instance
there
is
dr
greenleaf
living
some
six
miles
out
in
the
prairie
who
is
worth
twenty
five
thousand
dollars
and
his
neighbor
gates
not
worth
one
thousand
dollars
neither
of
them
is
in
debt
and
both
are
responsible
for
any
amount
they
will
be
likely
to
desire
to
purchase
on
credit
but
still
the
probability
of
the
latter
breaking
before
the
former
should
either
of
them
fall
through
is
quite
apparent
hence
one
is
safer
than
the
other
and
hence
it
would
be
both
just
and
politic
for
us
to
put
goods
a
shade
lower
to
the
former
than
the
latter
but
with
a
sly
injunction
that
the
price
is
not
to
be
told
to
any
one
which
is
another
means
of
pleasing
a
rich
man
for
all
like
to
be
made
conscious
of
the
realization
of
the
advantages
which
wealth
is
these
and
a
thousand
other
peculiarities
of
the
people
a
village
store
is
one
of
the
best
places
in
the
world
to
learn
human
nature
by
this
time
i
complained
of
weariness
and
we
got
up
to
make
arrangements
for
sleep
we
had
no
bed
but
it
was
a
part
of
the
western
merchant
s
discipline
to
sleep
without
one
it
was
not
long
before
the
litter
was
swept
from
the
floor
and
two
pallets
consisting
of
coarse
cotton
cloth
and
blankets
with
two
pieces
of
flannel
as
pillows
were
in
readiness
to
receive
our
weary
limbs
it
was
in
vain
i
sought
repose
my
over
wrought
system
refused
to
slumber
a
feverish
excitement
possessed
my
brain
and
i
turned
and
tossed
on
my
hard
bed
for
more
than
an
hour
without
enjoying
any
of
the
benefits
of
nature
s
sweet
restorer
once
i
placed
my
hand
beyond
my
scanty
couch
and
my
fingers
dropped
into
a
crack
in
the
floor
about
an
inch
wide
i
had
noticed
a
number
of
these
no
importance
to
them
now
my
active
imagination
did
not
fail
to
conjure
up
all
kinds
of
venomous
serpents
gliding
but
a
few
inches
beneath
us
i
fancied
that
some
of
them
had
ascended
into
the
room
and
might
be
in
the
fatal
coil
near
my
head
ready
to
bury
their
fangs
in
the
first
one
of
us
that
should
move
by
a
convulsive
effort
i
succeeded
in
springing
into
a
chair
on
which
my
clothes
were
placed
and
after
igniting
a
lucifer
match
and
casting
a
hurried
glance
at
my
brother
to
see
that
he
was
safe
proceeded
to
light
a
candle
my
movement
awoke
joseph
who
sat
upright
in
amazement
and
demanded
the
cause
of
my
strange
conduct
i
told
him
that
there
were
serpents
under
the
floor
the
house
not
being
underpinned
that
i
was
sure
i
had
heard
them
moving
about
under
the
place
where
i
had
been
lying
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
entering
the
room
through
the
ample
crevices
in
the
floor
joseph
reproached
he
rose
slowly
from
his
position
and
looked
cautiously
around
him
he
then
followed
my
example
and
placed
his
pallet
on
the
counter
the
counter
was
just
long
enough
between
the
window
and
the
angle
where
it
turned
towards
the
partition
wall
to
admit
of
our
lying
full
length
on
it
without
touching
each
other
s
feet
my
head
was
just
under
the
window
and
his
in
the
opposite
direction
our
feet
met
in
the
centre
or
were
only
a
few
inches
apart
by
degrees
i
sank
into
an
unquiet
slumber
on
my
narrow
bed
but
i
was
restless
and
moved
about
a
good
deal
during
the
night
once
i
was
awakened
by
my
feet
coming
city
of
course
you
have
many
opportunities
of
studying
human
nature
you
can
estimate
the
amount
of
interest
which
the
mass
of
people
will
take
in
this
scheme
you
can
measure
the
amount
o
pop
lar
gullability
said
the
portly
gentleman
whose
red
neckchief
looked
pale
beside
his
scarlet
face
why
s
i
r
r
in
the
course
o
ten
years
exper
ence
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
public
is
an
animal
remarkable
for
the
size
of
its
throat
and
the
magnitude
of
its
swallow
stands
to
reason
sir
that
a
public
as
swallows
our
poleese
system
must
have
a
throat
like

in
the
polar
regions

was
slightly
affected
with
the
bottle
very
slightly
in
his
sober
moments
his
geography
was
not
of
the
most
accurate
character
you
might
measure
his
phases
of
his
inebriety
by
that
word
mount
vesuvius
when
quite
sober
he
located
it
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
slightly
elevated
he
placed
it
in
the
polar
regions
pretty
far
gone
and
he
spoke
of
it
as
a
celebrated
volcano
somewhere
in
asia
or
rooshe
a
here
is
the
plan
murmured
brother
caleb
fixing
his
large
blue
eyes
on
the
sheet
of
parchment
and
here
are
thirty
names
each
signed
opposite
from
fifty
to

said
yes
and
brother
caleb
rose
from
his
seat
his
tall
lean
form
attired
in
the
blue
coat
and
white
vest
was
strongly
relieved
by
the
dark
mahogany
of
the
folding
doors
at
his
back
his
singular
face
with
its
hollow
cheeks
and
great
blue
eyes
protruding
from
their
sockets
attracted
even
the
drunken
gaze
of
the
midnight
guests
for
a
moment
he
surveyed
the
company
who
were
gathered
in
that
spacious
and
luxurious
chamber
his
thin
lips
were
agitated
by
a
peculiar
smile
the
dull
surface
of
his
blue
eyes
flashed
with
momentary
light
indeed
my
dear
goodleigh
laughed
mrs

from
the
end
of
the
table
a
poetical
mind
would
compare
you
at
the
present
moment
to

surveying
his

in

the
lady
seemed
to
lose
the
thread
of
her
thought
for
without

pause
she
continued
smiled
pleasantly
uttered
some
colloquial
compliment
and
then
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that

up

i
will
bring
it
to
you
excuse
me
for
a
single
moment

voices
and
more
excused

opened
the
folding

and
disappeared
into

cried
scissleby
from

no
sooner
had
the

closed
behind
the
tall
form
of

caleb
than
the
thirty
original
stockholders
of

commenced
an
irregular
and
whispering
conversation
concerning

the

the

had
disappeared
and
as
the

made
the
circuit
of

the

commenced
a

discussion
upon

abstruse
point

stewel
and
caleb
stepping
across
the
threshold
brother
caleb
closed
the
folding
doors
behind
him
and
approached
a
table
on
which
a
small
lamp
was
burning
it
was
the
large
room
described
in
the
revelations
of
the
entranced

the
lamp
emitted
but
a
faint
light
and
the
apartment
furnished
with
all
the
appointments
of
wealth

luxury
looked
vast
and
cheerless
as
the
dim
ray
flickered
amid
its
splendid
gloom
as
brother
caleb
extended
his
hand
to
grasp
the
lamp
his
singular
face
was
displayed
in
strong
light
and
deep
shadow
what

breaking
abruptly
from
the
dead
stillness
startled
even
the
firm
nerves
of
brother
caleb
into
a
tremor
hey
what
what
you
here
he
said
as
he
turned
and
saw
the
full
moon
face
of
stewel
pydgeon
at
his
shoulder
i
m
a
poleese
offisser
i
am
said
stewel
with
emphasis
do
nt
you
remember
breathe
her
name
let
the
old
man
even
your
father
lord
ralph
have
him
go
to
the
presence
of
his
god
with
a
curse
upon
his
soul
while
the
priest
and
the
woman
by
his
side
conversed
in
whispers
a
dead
awe
had
fallen
upon
all
the
other
faces
which
were
clustered
near
the
light
gazing
upon
the
shrunken
form
and
white
beared
face
of
the
dying
lord
for
the
first
time
in
an
hour
he
spoke
sword
that
my
fathers
bore
to
battle
you
will
rest
upon
my
bosom
when
i
am
dust
there
will
be
no
hand
to
wield
you
when
i
am
dead
bury
me
he
said
without
once
turning
his
eyes
with
my
armour
on
and
my
sword
by
my
side
let
the
banner
of
wyttonhurst
be
taken
from
the
hall
and
wrap
it
about
my
coffin
so
that
all
the
world
may
know
that
the
house
of
my
fathers
is
dead
father
said
a
low
pleading
voice
and
the
old
man
felt
a
warm
hand
upon
his
chilled
fingers
it
is
a
true
daughter
of
our
race
she
will
soon
follow
her
father
to
the
charnel
in
all
the
world
there
will
not
be
left
a
human
thing
with
a
drop
of
our
blood
in
their
veins
and
as
a
single
tear
rolled
down
his
wasted
cheek
he
surrendered
his
thin
hand
already
damp
with
death
to
the
clasp
of
his
faithful
child
her
soft
golden
hair
was
already
touched
with
grey
her
cheeks
had
been
robbed
of
their
warm
hues
by
the
hard
and
bitter
experience
of
life
and
yet
as
she
bent
her
face
near
to
the
stern
visage
of
her
father
not
a
heart
in
the
dreary
chamber
but
was
touched
by
the
sight
faithful
murmured
the
old
lord
true
to
the
last
even
the
leaden
visage
of
the
priest
relented
and
something
like
humanity
lighted
his
dead
eye
balls
but
father
and
shuddering
as
she
spoke
the
widowed
daughter
enfolded
him
in
her
arms
and
pressed
her
lips
to
his
clammy
smiles
upon
you
now
i
beseech
you
forgive
your
wandering
child
forgive
your
lost
alice
do
not
o
as
the
dread
hereafter
already
rushes
upon
your
fading
sight
do
not
curse
your
own
flesh
and
blood
without
a
word
the
old
man
raised
his
death
stricken
arm
and
gathering
his
failing
strength
for
the
effort
thrust
her
arms
from
his
neck
her
face
from
his
cheek
his
brow
glowed
with
a
stern
unforgiving
look
the
lines
of
his
face
grew
suddenly
rigid
as
with
the
outward
indications
of
an
unrelenting
will
forgive
her
the
cold
tone
of
the
priest
fell
like
ice
upon
the
daughter
s
heart
did
she
not
child
as
she
was
of
the
old
man
s
heart
betrothed
to
a
lord
of
noble
lineage
forsake
her
father
her
betrothed
husband
leave
these
very
walls
to
share
the
fate
of
a
low
born
peasant
knave
who
could
not
call
one
rood
of
ground
his
own
as
she
confronted
the
priest
yet
still
she
is
of
our
own
blood
she
is
my
sister
she
is
alice
of
wyttonhurst
a
murmur
pervaded
the
apartment
and
the
eyes
of
the
spectators
was
fixed
upon
the
brave
woman
who
true
to
the
holiest
instincts
of
her
nature
dared
even
the
anger
of
her
dying
father
in
the
attempt
to
wring
from
his
chilled
lips
only
one
word
of
blessing
one
accent
of
forgiveness
but
no
accent
of
forgiveness
came
stern
cold
and
unrelenting
he
gazed
upon
the
armour
the
sword
and
the
image
of
the
dying
redeemer
murmuring
with
his
husky
voice
a
curse
upon
alice
his
lost
daughter
and
when
the
priest
was
encircled
by
white
robed
children
with
silver
censers
swinging
in
their
little
hands
when
the
words
of
the
last
sacrament
trembled
from
his
lips
rolling
in
full
deep
melody
through
the
dreary
chamber
while
the
daughter
knelt
by
the
bed
and
the
servitors
were
bowing
their
heads
against
the
floor
still
with
sat
erect
on
his
couch
coupling
with
a
curse
the
name
of
the
younger
daughter
alice
shall
we
leave
this
scene
where
death
is
clad
in
grandeur
and
vengeance
in
order
to
comprehend
it
more
fully
shall
we
behold
death
rudely
clad
in
misery
and
chains
in
a
cell
sunken
far
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
with
a
huge
mass
of
walls
and
chambers
between
its
arched
ceiling
and
the
light
of
the
stars
an
executioner
torch
in
hand
came
to
look
upon
his
victim
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
damp
cell
his
pale
face
with
cold
eyeballs
and
thin
severe
lips
standing
out
from
his
black
cowl
for
the
executioner
did
not
appear
in
the
form
of
a
headsman
with
a
sharp
axe
in
his
brawny
hand
but
as
a
monk
with
the
cold
sneer
on
his
withered
lips
a
calm
scorn
in
his
impassible
eyes
above
him
frowned
the
arch
of
the
cell
around
him
brooded
the
shadows
through
whose
darkness
pale
dreary
lustre
at
his
feet
crouching
on
a
rude
seat
a
solid
block
of
stone
was
his
prisoner
or
victim
chained
by
the
wrists
and
ancles
to
the
floor
the
light
of
the
torch
disclosed
him
as
bowing
his
head
between
his
hands
they
rested
on
his
knees
he
seemed
to
be
lost
to
all
consciousness
in
a
miserable
repose
one
year
of
night
and
silence
will
wither
the
bravest
form
a
year
ago
across
the
threshold
he
stepped
with
a
bold
and
agile
stride
and
as
the
door
grated
behind
him
a
smile
flashed
over
his
features
look
upon
him
now
nearer
to
the
couching
form
the
spectator
held
his
light
but
the
prisoner
did
not
move
it
was
pitiable
to
see
him
as
he
sat
upon
the
hard
stone
irons
upon
his
wrist
and
chains
extending
from
his
ancles
to
the
massy
ring
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
it
was
but
the
wreck
of
a
man
a
muscular
stride
wrecked
suddenly
into
a
living
skeleton
whose
the
ears
of
the
ultra
devout
of
late
said
the
artist
there
has
been
a
lively
demand
for
the
image
of
arbino
the
god
of
fishing
the
present
being
the
principal
season
for
that
business
for
nadams

over
love
and

has
also
been
urgent

it
being
the
time
of
the
grape
and
the
maidens
growing
frolicsome
withal
and
devotional
seeing
that
hevaneva
handled
his
wares
with
much
familiarity
not
to
say
irreverence
babbalanja
was
minded
to
learn
from
him
what
he
thought
of
his
trade
whether
the
images
he
made
were
genuine
or
spurious
in
a
word
whether
he
believed
in
his
gods
his
reply
was
curious
but
still
more
so
the
marginal
gestures
wherewith
he
helped
out
the
text
when
i
cut
down
the
trees
for
my
but
logs
when
upon
those
logs
i
chalk
out
the
figures
of
my
images
they
yet
remain
logs
when
the
chisel
is
applied
logs
they
are
still
and
when
all
complete
i
at
last
stand
them
up
in
my
studio
even
then
they
are
logs
nevertheless
when
i
handle
the
pay
they
are
as
prime
gods
as
ever
were
turned
out
in
maramma
you
must
make
a
very
great
variety
said
babbalanja
all
sorts
all
sorts
and
from
the
same
material
i
presume
ay
ay
one
grove
supplies
them
all
and
on
an
average
each
tree
stands
us
in
full
fifty
idols
then
we
often
take
second
hand
images
in
part
pay
for
new
ones
these
we
work
over
again
into
new
patterns

up
their
eyes
and

more
especially

lucrative
business

profits
whereof

he
dropped

his
private
exchequer

that
as
it
may
hevaneva
drove
a
thriving
trade
at
both
avocations
and
in
demonstration
of
the
fact
he
directed
our
attention
to
three
long
rows
of
canoes
upheld
by
wooden
supports
they
were
in
perfect
order

a

tale
of
babbalanja
s
having
taken
to
our
canoes
once
again
we
were
silently
sailing
along
when
media
observed
babbalanja
though
i
seldom
trouble
myself
with
such
thoughts
i
have
just
been
thinking
how
difficult
it
must
be
for
the
more
ignorant
sort
of
people
to
decide
upon
what
particular
image
to
worship
as
a
guardian
deity
when
in
maramma
it
seems
there
exists
such
a
multitude
of
idols
and
a
thousand
more
are
to
be
heard
of
not
at
all
your
highness
the
more
ignorant
the
better
the
multitude
of
images
distracts
them
not
but
i
am
you
a
story
a
story
hear
him
the
solemn
philosopher
is
desirous
of
regaling
us
with
a
tale
but
pray
begin
once
upon
a
time
then
said
babbalanja
indifferently
adjusting
his
girdle
nine
blind
men
with
uncommonly
long
noses
set
out
on
their
travels
to
see
the
great
island
on
which
they
were
born
a
precious
beginning
muttered
mohi
nine
blind
men
setting
out
to
see
sights
continued
babbalanja
staff
in
hand
they
traveled
one
in
advance
of
the
other
each
man
with
his
palm
upon
the
shoulder
next
him
and
he
with
the
longest
nose
took
the
lead
of
the
file
journeying
on
in
this
manner
they
came
to
a
valley
in
which
reigned
a
king
called
tammaro
now
in
a
certain
inclosure
toward
the
head
of
the
valley
there
stood
an
immense
wild
banian
tree
all
over
moss
and
many
centuries
old
and
forming
quite
a
wood
and
fixing
there
as
many
gigantic
trunks
with
tammaro
it
had
long
been
a
question
which
of
those
many
trunks
was
the
original
and
true
one
a
matter
that
had
puzzled
the
wisest
heads
among
his
subjects
and
in
vain
had
a
reward
been
offered
for
the
solution
of
the
perplexity
but
the
tree
was
so
vast
and
its
fabric
so
complex
and
its
rooted
branches
so
similar
in
appearance
and
so
numerous
from
the
circumstance
that
every
year
had
added
to
them
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
determine
the
point
nevertheless
no
sooner
did
the
nine
blind
men
hear
that
there
was
a
reward
offered
for
discovering
the
trunk
of
a
tree
standing
all
by
itself
than
one
and
all
they
assured
tammaro
that
they
would
quickly
settle
that
little
difficulty
of
his
and
loudly
inveighed
against
the
stupidity
of
his
sages
who
had
been
so
easily
posed
so
being
conducted
into
the
inclosure
and
assured
that
the
tree
was
somewhere
within
they
separated
it
at
a
distance
when
feeling
their
way
with
their
staves
and
their
noses
they
advanced
to
the
search
crying
out
pshaw
make
room
there
let
us
wise
men
feel
of
the
mystery
presently
striking
with
his
nose
one
of
the
rooted
branches
the
foremost
blind
man
quickly
knelt
down
and
feeling
that
it
struck
into
the
earth
gleefully
shouted
here
it
is
here
it
is
but
almost
in
the
same
breath
his
companions
also
each
striking
a
branch
with
his
staff
or
his
nose
caught
every
variety
of
fish
at
last
i
saw
a
chance
and
crowded
in
for
the
hole
and
in
order
to
be
beforehand
with
a
big
man
who
just
then
came
in
i
pushed
my
gun
violently
through
the
hole
upon
which
the
hook
nosed
man
cried
out
thinking
i
was
going
to
shoot
him
but
at
last
he
took
the
gun
turned
it
end
for
end
clicked
the
trigger
three
times
and
then
said
one
dollar
what
about
one
dollar
said
i
that
s
all
i
ll
give
he
replied
well
what
do
you
want
and
he
turned
to
the
next
person
this
was
a
young
man
in
a
seedy
red
cravat
and
a
pimply
face
that
looked
as
if
it
was
going
to
seed
likewise
who
with
a
mysterious
tapping
of
his
vest
pocket
and
other
hints
but
the
hook
nosed
man
spoke
out
very
loud
and
said
none
of
that
take
it
out
got
a
stolen
watch
we
do
nt
deal
in
them
things
here
upon
this
the
young
man
flushed
all
over
and
looked
round
to
see
who
had
heard
the
pawnbroker
then
he
took
something
very
small
out
of
his
pocket
and
keeping
it
hidden
under
his
palm
pushed
it
into
the
hole
where
did
you
get
this
ring
said
the
pawnbroker
i
want
to
pawn
it
whispered
the
other
blushing
all
over
again
what
s
your
name
said
the
pawnbroker
speaking
very
loud
how
much
will
you
give
whispered
the
other
in
reply
leaning
over
and
looking
as
if
he
wanted
to
hush
up
the
pawnbroker
at
last
the
sum
was
agreed
upon
when
the
man
behind
the
counter
took
a
little
ticket
and
tying
the
ring
to
it
began
to
write
on
the
ticket
all
at
once
question
which
embarrassed
him
very
much
but
at
last
he
stammered
out
a
certain
number
in
broadway
that
s
the
city
hotel
you
do
nt
live
there
said
the
man
cruelly
glancing
at
the
shabby
coat
before
him
oh
well
stammered
the
other
blushing
scarlet
i
thought
this
was
only
a
sort
of
form
to
go
through
i
do
nt
like
to
tell
where
i
do
live
for
i
ai
nt
in
the
habit
of
going
to
pawnbrokers
you
stole
that
ring
you
know
you
did
roared
out
the
hook
nosed
man
incensed
at
this
slur
upon
his
calling
and
now
seemingly
bent
on
damaging
the
young
man
s
character
for
life
i
m
a
good
mind
to
call
a
constable
we
do
nt
take
stolen
goods
here
i
tell
you
all
eyes
were
now
fixed
suspiciously
upon
this
martyrized
young
man
who
looked
ready
to
drop
into
the
earth
and
a
poor
woman
in
a
night
cap
with
some
as
if
dreading
to
encounter
such
a
terrible
pattern
of
integrity
at
last
the
young
man
slunk
off
with
his
money
and
looking
out
of
the
window
i
saw
him
go
round
the
corner
so
sharply
that
he
knocked
his
elbow
against
the
wall
i
waited
a
little
longer
and
saw
several
more
served
and
having
remarked
that
the
hook
nosed
men
invariably
fixed
their
own
price
upon
every
thing
and
if
that
was
refused
told
the
person
to
be
off
with
himself
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
try
and
get
more
from
them
than
they
had
offered
especially
when
i
saw
that
they
had
a
great
many
fowling
pieces
hanging
up
and
did
not
have
particular
occasion
for
mine
and
more
than
that
they
must
be
very
well
off
and
rich
to
treat
people
so
cavalierly
my
best
plan
then
seemed
to
be
to
go
right
back
to
the
curly
headed
pawnbroker
and
take
up
with
my
first
offer
but
when
i
went
back
the
curly
headed
man
was
very
long
time
at
last
i
got
a
chance
and
told
him
i
would
take
the
three
dollars
he
had
offered
ought
to
have
taken
it
when
you
could
get
it
he
replied
i
wo
nt
give
but
two
dollars
and
a
half
for
it
now
in
vain
i
expostulated
he
was
not
to
be
moved
so
i
pocketed
the
money
and
departed
chapter
v
he
purchases
his
sea
wardrobe
and
on
a
dismal
rainy
day
picks
up
his
board
and
lodging
along
the
wharves
the
first
thing
i
now
did
was
to
buy
a
little
stationery
and
keep
my
promise
to
my
mother
by
writing
her
and
i
also
wrote
to
my
brother
informing
him
of
the
voyage
i
purposed
making
and
indulging
in
some
romantic
and
misanthropic
views
of
life
such
as
many
boys
in
my
circumstances
are
accustomed
to
do
the
rest
of
the
two
dollars
and
a
half
i
laid
out
that
very
morning
in
buying
a
red
woolen
shirt
near
catharine
market
a
tarpaulin
hat
a
belt
and
jack
knife
and
two
or
three
trifles
after
these
purchases
i
had
only
one
penny
left
so
i
walked
out
to
the
end
of
the
pier
and
threw
the
penny
into
the
water
the
reason
why
i
did
this
was
because
i
somehow
felt
almost
desperate
again
and
did
nt
care
what
became
of
me
but
if
the
penny
had
been
a
dollar
i
would
have
kept
it
i
went
home
to
dinner
at
mr
jones
and
they
welcomed
me
very
kindly
and
mrs
jones
kept
my
plate
full
all
the
time
during
dinner
so
that
i
had
no
chance
to
empty
it
she
seemed
to
see
that
i
felt
bad
and
thought
plenty
of
pudding
might
help
me
at
any
rate
i
never
felt
so
bad
yet
but
i
could
eat
a
good
dinner
and
once
years
afterward
when
i
expected
to
be
killed
every
day
i
remember
my
appetite
was
very
keen
and
i
said
to
myself
eat
away
be
the
last
supper
you
will
have
after
dinner
i
went
into
my
room
locked
the
door
carefully
and
hung
a
towel
over
the
knob
so
that
no
one
could
peep
through
the
keyhole
and
then
went
of
the
unadorned
simplicity
affected
by
the
puritan
women
of
england
were
not
unbecoming
to
a
figure
slightly
exceeding
middle
height
and
possessing
the
robust
healthful
but
eminently
feminine
development
characteristic
of
english
beauty
and
heightened
her
resemblance
to
those
types
of
virgin
grace
and
purity
the
early
madonnas
painted
by
raphael
while
something
of
perrugino
s
severity
still
lingered
around
his
pencil
wearied
with
her
solitary
reflections
she
at
last
arose
and
wandered
through
the
open
glade
which
stretched
from
the
edge
of
the
pine
forest
near
their
residence
and
growth
and
covered
with
strong
coarse
grass
springing
in
wild
luxuriance
from
the
virgin
soil
she
amused
herself
with
gathering
a
few
violets
almost
buried
in
the
rank
verdure
and
sighed
as
she
compared
their
almost
scentless
petals
with
the
delicious
fragrance
of
their
sister
flowers
at
home
the
oaks
which
studded
the
waving
sea
of
turf
around
her
brought
to
her
remembrance
the
bosky
parks
and
ancestral
trees
of
england
and
the
early
birds
of
spring
filling
the
air
with
their
clamorous
melody
as
they
darted
from
the
ground
or
made
the
leafless
spray
vocal
with
their
love
songs
soothed
her
thoughts
and
bore
them
far
away
to
softer
and
fondly
remembered
scenes
she
had
wandered
insensibly
farther
from
her
palisaded
home
than
she
intended
and
was
approaching
a
thickly
wooded
and
swampy
forest
of
maples
and
birches
in
which
the
glade
was
terminated
when
she
was
suddenly
startled
from
her
reverie
by
a
low
suppressed
noise
which
strangely
resembled
the
angry
growling
of
a
dog
what
was
her
upon
the
verge
of
the
thicket
standing
motionless
with
eyes
glaring
full
upon
her
twenty
paces
from
the
spot
where
she
stood
the
animal
was
as
large
as
the
largest
sized
dog
and
might
have
been
mistaken
for
one
but
for
his
small
erect
ears
pointed
snout
and
long
bushy
tail
resembling
that
of
a
fox
grisly
grey
in
color
broad
breasted
lean
paunched
with
yellow
green
eyes
flashing
savage
fire
upon
her
he
sat
upon
his
haunches
motionless
as
if
carved
in
stone
and
fascinating
the
lonely
girl
by
his
fixed
and
terrible
stare
the
american
wolf
is
a
ferocious
but
comparatively
a
cowardly
animal
and
except
impelled
by
famine
is
slow
to
attack
the
human
race
the
winter
had
however
been
long
and
stern
and
these
savage
creatures
had
often
hunted
in
droves
about
the
neighborhood
preying
upon
the
few
domestic
animals
which
the
planters
had
brought
with
them
and
filling
the
air
at
midnight
with
their
howlings
esther
was
aware
that
were
accustomed
to
encounter
these
brutes
single
handed
without
fear
and
she
had
often
been
told
that
the
animal
would
shrink
like
a
whipped
cur
from
the
attack
of
man
but
thus
solitary
and
far
from
help
to
be
confronted
with
a
ferocious
beast
of
the
forest
was
a
fearful
thing
for
a
maiden
nurtured
all
her
life
in
the
security
of
a
civilized
land
frozen
almost
to
a
statue
with
terror
with
marble
cheek
rigid
lips
suppressed
breath
and
eyes
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
she
instinctively
and
as
if
impelled
by
an
irresistible
fascination
gazed
full
into
the
eyes
of
her
ferocious
antagonist
the
lion
is
fabled
to
crouch
submissively
at
a
virgin
s
feet
but
the
wolf
who
cowers
before
the
strong
man
was
never
thought
to
be
generous
to
the
helpless
was
it
then
the
mysterious
power
of
the
human
eye
which
seemed
to
exert
its
subtle
and
unfathomable
influence
upon
that
compact
mass
of
savage
sinew
bone
and
muscle
subjugating
the
will
which
they
which
would
have
driven
the
brute
with
one
savage
bound
upon
its
prey
could
it
be
fear
that
kept
the
monster
motionless
crouching
but
glaring
still
with
those
eyeballs
of
fire
was
it
all
real
or
was
her
fearful
foe
but
a
phantom
of
her
heated
imagination
her
brain
reeled
the
vast
and
leafless
oaks
seemed
to
whirl
and
dance
around
her
the
mighty
forest
swaying
before
the
rising
wind
seemed
to
rush
through
the
air
sweeping
and
shifting
from
earth
to
heaven
as
in
the
mad
and
bewildering
changes
of
a
dream
the
incessant
and
shrill
notes
of
a
thousand
singing
birds
thrilled
in
her
ears
like
the
warning
cry
of
invisible
spirits
every
thing
seemed
to
move
and
change
around
her
there
was
a
rushing
in
her
ears
as
of
a
mighty
wind
and
then
all
seemed
growing
black
as
a
funeral
pall
she
roused
herself
from
the
swoon
which
she
felt
was
coming
over
her
it
was
no
dream
the
woods
had
ceased
to
move
she
was
alone
in
the
wilderness
and
there
stood
the
gaunt
wolf
with
his
glittering
teeth
and
fearful
stare
motionless
and
threatening
as
before
she
roused
herself
at
last
and
became
perfectly
calm
she
reflected
that
the
beast
who
shrunk
from
the
conflict
with
a
man
might
even
cower
before
the
attack
of
a
determined
woman
she
had
a
slight
branch
in
her
hand
which
she
had
accidentally
picked
from
the
ground
in
her
walk
a
dried
leafless
last
year
s
shoot
feeble
as
a
rush
and
held
in
the
weak
hand
of
a
woman
but
she
had
aroused
her
spirit
now
her
heart
throbbed
high
with
excitement
and
the
blood
which
had
been
chilled
bounded
like
impetuous
fire
through
her
veins
she
advanced
a
step
forward
brandishing
the
weapon
above
her
head
with
her
eyes
flashing
full
upon
her
adversary
the
wolf
sprang
to
his
feet
glared
fixedly
upon
her
but
stood
motionless
as
before
he
seemed
irresolute
whether
to
advance
upon
his
antagonist
step
nearer
her
nerves
quivering
with
strange
excitement
it
was
a
contest
not
of
strength
but
of
nerve
not
of
muscle
but
of
spirit
her
foe
remained
motionless
upon
his
feet
she
advanced
another
step
she
was
near
enough
to
hear
his
suppressed
breathing
another
and
the
wolf
with
a
furious
glare
opened
his
armed
jaws
and
uttered
a
long
dismal
howl
which
resounded
fearfully
through
the
forest
and
struck
renewed
terror
to
ever
a
falcon
in
all
the
world
who
stooped
more
gallantly
master
jaspar
concluded
he
turning
suddenly
round
shame
upon
thy
his
side
which
sounded
very
unlike
that
of
gardiner
or
of
jaspar
how
often
o
thou
master
of
misrule
wilt
thou
provoke
us
in
the
wilderness
and
grieve
us
in
the
desert
and
who
the
devil
art
thou
cried
morton
in
astonishment
who
art
thus
prophesying
upon
the
salt
marshes
morton
might
well
have
been
surprised
for
as
he
looked
about
him
there
was
not
a
trace
to
be
seen
of
sir
christopher
and
the
gentle
jaspar
and
in
their
places
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
a
party
of
grim
visaged
puritans
armed
to
the
teeth
who
evidently
intended
to
devote
themselves
that
morning
exclusively
to
himself
so
absorbed
had
he
been
in
observing
the
struggle
between
his
falcon
and
the
heron
that
the
party
had
advanced
upon
him
and
made
him
their
prisoner
before
he
was
in
the
least
aware
of
their
approach
sir
christopher
gardiner
however
whose
eagle
eye
keener
than
that
of
hawk
or
heron
had
observed
the
party
at
an
unsuccessful
search
at
merry
mount
they
descended
upon
the
marshes
had
eluded
their
observation
and
accompanied
by
his
cousin
had
glided
unperceived
away
at
a
time
when
morton
in
his
eagerness
had
advanced
to
so
great
a
distance
that
it
was
wholly
out
of
the
knight
s
power
to
give
him
warning
as
sir
christopher
had
repeatedly
but
fruitlessly
reminded
his
reckless
companion
of
his
danger
and
as
he
had
no
desire
unnecessarily
to
expose
his
character
to
suspicion
by
allowing
himself
to
be
found
in
the
company
of
one
whom
the
puritans
considered
so
disreputable
and
odious
he
had
felt
no
hesitation
in
thus
disappearing
as
rapidly
as
possible
morton
being
used
to
such
scenes
saw
at
once
that
all
resistance
would
be
useless
moreover
after
the
first
surprise
was
over
and
he
had
found
himself
captured
beyond
all
peradventure
his
thoughts
reverted
to
his
dead
falcon
that
he
was
arrested
did
not
surprise
him
and
he
had
long
since
exhausted
his
indignation
at
the
tyrannical
persecution
he
should
soon
extricate
himself
he
thought
from
this
new
dilemma
but
who
could
restore
to
life
his
gallant
hawk
who
he
had
been
training
so
long
and
who
was
as
dear
to
him
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
looking
with
profound
contempt
at
the
rigid
countenances
of
his
captors
he
again
raised
the
dead
body
of
his
favorite
from
the
ground
and
placed
it
in
his
bosom
absorbed
in
his
melancholy
reflections
he
stood
there
fondling
the
creature
whispering
and
whistling
to
her
as
if
his
endearments
could
recall
her
to
life
and
hearing
not
a
single
word
of
the
long
exhortation
with
which
the
leader
of
the
party
was
indulging
him
finding
his
eloquence
so
utterly
lost
upon
the
hardened
sinner
captain
underwood
broke
off
in
his
address
saying
only
in
conclusion
thou
wilt
follow
me
now
and
that
obediently
o
thou
master
of
misrule
else
shall
it
go
hard
with
thee
and
whither
most
peremptory
of
puritans
said
to
charlestown
even
unto
the
magistrates
who
have
ordered
thy
instantaneous
arrest
now
effected
by
their
unworthy
servants
and
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
magistrates
of
charlestown
or
they
with
me
replied
morton
truly
i
have
as
little
relish
for
their
company
as
they
for
mine
verily
answered
captain
underwood
governor
winthrop
the
deputy
and
all
the
assistants
hold
a
solemn
court
to
morrow
to
which
thou
art
formally
cited
then
and
there
to
answer
for
thy
various
misdemeanors
verily
the
magistrates
do
intend
to
erect
their
authority
throughout
the
land
they
shall
smite
their
enemies
in
the
hinder
part
and
put
them
to
perpetual
reproach
so
saying
the
captain
of
the
party
led
the
way
and
his
soldiers
taking
morton
in
their
midst
started
on
their
march

of

stood
in
the
corner
of
the
large
room
in
the
great
house
at
charlestown
this
building
which
had
been
constructed
with
especial
care
by
mr
graves
during
the
previous
year
expressly
to
serve
as
a
government
house
was
a
timber
work
mansion
of
very
respectable
dimensions
and
stood
upon
the
open
plain
below
the
mishawum
hills
in
its
neighborhood
were
huddled
together
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
booths
tents
and
wigwams
in
which
the
emigrants
had
established
their
temporary
residence
and
in
which
they
were
suffering
dreadful
ravages
from
the
sickness
which
still
prevailed
with
unabated
fury
as
nearly
the
whole
population
were
upon
the
point
of
removing
to
the
south
side
of
the
charles
river
where
at
least
they
could
promise
themselves
a
supply
of
wholesome
water
which
was
denied
to
them
at
mishawum
the
infant
village
of
charlestown
presented
rather
the
appearance
of
a
temporary
encampment
than
of
an
organized
town
still
however
the
forms
of
government
were
rigidly
observed
and
the
governor
with
most
of
the
and
benevolent
in
relieving
the
sufferings
of
the
people
still
maintained
throughout
all
the
difficulties
which
beset
them
an
elevated
and
decorous
deportment
which
invested
their
responsible
offices
the
potentate
of
merry
mount
with
the
good
humored
expression
which
habitually
characterized
his
face
was
looking
carelessly
round
him
whistling
and
talking
to
himself
besides
making
occasionally
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
draw
some
one
of
his
attendants
into
conversation
the
magistrates
had
not
yet
made
their
appearance
in
the
apartment
although
they
were
soon
expected
as
the
third
court
of
assistants
which
had
been
held
in
massachusetts
since
the
arrival
of
winthrop
with
the
charter
was
to
be
held
that
morning
besides
the
armed
attendants
upon
the
magistrates
who
answered
morton
s
flippant
remarks
with
forbidding
silence
there
were
clustered
together
in
the
different
corners
of
the
room
a
few
stragglers
who
appeared
to
be
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
court
and
who
in
the
mean
time
were
conversing
in
a
low
tone
and
any
one
who
has
heard
the
senator
from
carolina
would
say
that
the
resemblance
between
himself
and
his
illustrious
relative
extended
from
great
things
to
small
ones
at
the
first
glance
at
mr
wirt
s
countenance
when
he
was
not
engaged
in
conversation
or
business
the
observer
would
have
been
struck
with
the
true
dignity
of
the
man
whose
mind
seemed
to
hold
all
its
energies
in
perfect
control
his
self
possession
was
perfect
there
was
no
hurry
no
agitation
about
him
as
we
perceive
in
many
men
on
the
contrary
he
stood
collected
while
his
enunciation
was
deliberate
and
slow
he
stated
his
proposition
with
great
simplicity
in
fact
it
was
generally
a
self
evident
one
the
applicability
of
which
to
the
case
if
it
were
intricate
and
doubtful
the
hearer
might
in
vain
endeavor
to
trace
but
when
he
heard
the
orator
to
the
conclusion
he
would
wonder
that
he
had
fancied
any
uncertainty
about
it
for
mr
wirt
would
lead
him
on
by
the
gentlest
gradations
until
he
was
convinced
it
may
be
mentioned
too
that
mr
wirt
like
mr
clay
was
a
great
taker
of
snuff
and
he
handled
his
box
with
a
grace
which
would
have
rivalled
even
that
of
the
senator
from
kentucky
lord
chatham
it
was
said
made
his
crutch
a
weapon
of
oratory
you
talk
of
conquering
america
sir
said
he
i
might
as
well
attempt
to
drive
mr
wirt
made
and
mr
clay
makes
his
snuff
box
an
oratorical
weapon
mr
wirt
s
language
was
at
times
almost
oriental
his
figures
being
of
the
boldest
and
his
diction
correspondent
his
speeches
in
burr
s
trial
show
this
though
latterly
he
chastened
somewhat
his
diction
and
his
thoughts
he
sustained
himself
well
in
the
highest
flight
of
eloquence
his
hearers
having
no
fear
that
he
would
fall
from
his
eminence
like
him
in
the
fable
with
the
waxen
wings
on
the
contrary
the
hearer
felt
confident
of
his
intellectual
strength
and
yielded
his
whole
feelings
to
him
without
that
drawback
we
experience
in
listening
to
some
of
the
ablest
speakers
who
often
have
a
glaring
imperfection
which
is
continually
destroying
their
eloquence
mr
wirt
studied
oratory
with
ciceronian
care
and
in
the
recklessness
with
which
he
let
fly
the
arrows
of
his
wit
he
much
resembled
the
roman
the
power
of
ridiculing
his
adversary
was
mr
wirt
s
forte
the
appropriate
manner
in
which
he
applied
an
of
his
opponent
s
arguments
with
a
clearness
that
the
most
critical
logician
would
have
admired
after
he
had
illustrated
his
position
with
all
the
lights
of
law
that
law
whose
seat
hooker
said
is
the
bosom
of
god
and
whose
voice
is
the
harmony
of
the
world
and
when
mr
wirt
had
a
strong
case
he
explored
every
field
of
literature
and
science
bringing
their
joint
sanction
to
his
purposes
after
he
had
called
up
the
truths
of
philosophy
the
experience
of
history
and
the
beauties
of
poetry
all
coming
like
spirits
thronging
to
his
call
after
he
had
expatiated
upon
the
cause
with
such
reflections
as
you
would
suppose
barrow
or
tillotson
to
have
used
when
speaking
of
the
oppressor
s
wrong
after
he
had
done
all
this
mr
wirt
would
if
the
opposite
party
deserved
the
infliction
pour
forth
upon
him
a
lava
like
ridicule
which
flamed
while
it
burned
and
which
was
at
once
terrible
and
beautiful
terrible
from
its
severity
and
truth
conveyed
mr
wirt
always
struck
me
as
being
very
much
like
the
late
prime
minister
of
england
canning
in
his
mind
canning
wanted
and
wirt
in
a
degree
the
power
of
calling
up
and
controlling
the
stronger
and
deeper
passions
of
our
nature
he
had
not
that
withering
scorn
which
brougham
possesses
so
strongly
nor
could
he
rise
above
the
tempest
of
popular
commotion
as
he
tells
us
patrick
henry
could
and
soar
with
supreme
dominion
he
wanted
deep
passion
comparing
him
with
the
leading
orators
of
our
country
it
would
be
said
that
clay
far
surpassed
him
in
the
power
of
controlling
a
miscellaneous
assemblage
when
the
public
mind
was
deeply
agitated
that
pinckney
on
a
question
of
feudal
lore
webster
in
profundity
and
on
constitutional
law
and
that
preston
in
the
glow
of
vehement
declamation
would
have
had
the
advantage
over
him
but
before
an
auditory
who
loved
to
mingle
wit
with
argument
and
elegance
with
strength
who
would
make
truth
more
beautiful
by
the
of
truth
adding
to
all
those
exterior
graces
which
make
oratory
so
captivating
before
such
an
auditory
it
may
be
said
without
great
hesitation
that
mr
wirt
would
have
surpassed
either
of
them
in
general
effect
mr
wirt
s
gestures
too
that
of
which
the
grecian
thought
so
much
were
in
keeping
with
his
other
excellencies
the
fault
was
that
they
were
studied
and
yet
the
art
with
which
he
concealed
his
art
was
consummate
it
was
only
by
the
closest
observation
that
it
could
be
detected
for
a
long
time
mr
wirt
s
chief
opponent
at
the
baltimore
bar
was
mr
taney
the
present
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
mr
taney
removed
to
baltimore
from
frederick
on
the
death
of
pinckney
and
there
mr
wirt
and
himself
were
the
great
forensic
rivals
no
two
men
of
the
same
profession
could
be
more
different
in
their
intellectual
gifts
than
were
these
gentlemen
they
were
as
unlike
in
these
regards
as
they
were
in
their
personal
appearance
mr
now
improved
in
health
he
stooped
and
his
voice
was
weak
and
such
was
the
precarious
condition
of
his
health
that
he
had
to
station
himself
immediately
before
and
near
the
jury
to
make
himself
heard
by
them
mr
wirt
always
placed
himself
on
the
side
of
the
trial
table
opposite
the
jury
in
oratorical
position
mr
taney
s
manner
of
speaking
was
slow
and
firm
never
using
the
least
rhetorical
ornament
but
pressing
into
the
heart
of
the
case
with
powerful
arguments
like
a
great
leader
with
unbroken
phalanx
into
the
in
his
face
no
but
she
kept
me
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
door
what
did
she
say
she
was
trying
to
make
it
out
that
i
had
brought
the
wrong
bundle
and
so
she
opened
it
in
the
entry
but
it
was
only
to
keep
me
there
you
think
she
was
smitten
laughed
katy
i
have
an
opinion
replied
simon
sagely
my
face
katy
did
nt
think
any
fine
lady
could
be
much
charmed
with
that
thin
hatchet
face
and
she
realized
now
that
master
simon
was
a
great
heap
of
vanity
she
never
thought
before
that
he
could
be
so
silly
she
wanted
to
tell
him
that
he
was
a
great
fool
for
she
feared
he
would
never
find
it
out
himself
but
he
was
older
than
she
was
and
she
did
not
think
it
quite
proper
to
do
so
i
must
go
now
said
katy
if
you
do
nt
find
anything
you
like
better
you
can
sell
candy
you
know
katy
exclaimed
simon
sternly
i
am
poor
and
proud
master
simon
i
am
too
proud
to
be
dependent
or
do
anything
mean
and
wicked
but
i
am
not
too
proud
to
sell
candy
i
am
replied
simon
with
dignity
then
yours
is
a
foolish
pride
replied
katy
with
a
smile
toward
her
own
house
she
felt
thankful
that
she
had
no
such
pride
as
simon
s
and
she
had
reason
to
be
thankful
for
when
any
person
is
too
proud
to
do
the
work
which
god
has
placed
within
his
reach
he
becomes
a
pitiable
object
and
honest
men
will
regard
him
with
contempt
katy
had
to
work
very
hard
that
evening
in
making
candy
for
her
assistants
to
sell
and
it
was
nine
o
clock
before
she
was
ready
to
go
to
bed
the
next
morning
all
the
girls
who
had
engaged
to
come
appeared
with
their
trays
and
were
supplied
with
candy
katy
instructed
them
very
modestly
in
the
art
of
selling
taking
upon
herself
no
airs
and
assuming
no
superiority
ann
grippen
came
with
them
and
seemed
to
be
very
much
pleased
with
her
new
occupation
at
noon
they
all
returned
though
only
two
of
them
had
sold
out
their
two
dozen
sticks
katy
gave
them
further
instructions
in
regard
to
the
best
places
to
sell
candy
and
when
disposed
of
their
stock
the
experiment
therefore
was
regarded
as
a
successful
one
the
next
day
several
other
girls
who
had
heard
of
katy
s
plan
came
to
the
house
and
wanted
to
be
engaged
the
little
merchant
could
not
supply
them
but
promised
if
they
would
come
the
next
day
to
furnish
them
with
a
stock
even
now
the
quantity
manufactured
required
the
services
of
mrs
colvin
for
three
hours
and
this
day
she
engaged
her
to
come
immediately
after
dinner
i
need
not
detail
the
manner
in
which
katy
s
trade
kept
increasing
in
a
fortnight
she
had
more
than
a
dozen
girls
employed
in
selling
candy
she
was
actually
making
a
wholesale
business
of
it
and
no
longer
traveled
about
the
streets
herself
by
the
first
of
december
mrs
redburn
had
so
far
recovered
her
health
as
to
be
able
to
take
charge
of
the
manufacturing
part
of
the
business
and
katy
was
permitted
to
go
to
school
though
she
supplied
the
girls
in
the
morning
and
day
she
received
a
call
from
michael
mrs
gordon
s
man
requesting
her
attendance
in
temple
street
she
obeyed
the
summons
but
when
she
met
mrs
gordon
and
grace
she
was
alarmed
to
see
how
coldly
and
reproachfully
they
looked
upon
her
i
have
heard
a
very
bad
story
about
you
katy
said
mrs
gordon
about
me
gasped
she
yes
and
i
was
very
sorry
to
hear
it
what
was
it
ma
am
i
hope
i
have
nt
done
anything
to
lose
your
good
will
i
am
afraid
you
have
i
do
nt
believe
she
did
it
mother
said
grace
she
is
too
good
to
do
any
such
thing
what
is
it
do
tell
me
i
have
been
told
that
a
little
girl
who
sells
candy
has
been
playing
tricks
upon
passers
by
in
the
streets
that
she
tells
lies
and
deceives
them
i
never
did
such
with
the
blush
of
indignation
mrs
gordon
explained
the
deception
and
spoke
in
very
severe
terms
of
it
the
trick
had
been
played
off
on
a
friend
of
hers
who
had
told
of
it
the
evening
before
when
was
it
ma
am
asked
katy
yesterday
forenoon
i
was
in
school
then
besides
i
have
nt
sold
any
candy
in
the
street
for
more
than
three
weeks
i
knew
it
was
nt
she
exclaimed
grace
triumphantly
i
was
very
unwilling
to
believe
it
added
mrs
gordon
but
the
description
seemed
to
point
you
out
as
the
little
deceiver
i
would
nt
do
such
a
thing
ma
am
if
you
inquire
you
will
find
that
i
have
been
in
school
every
day
this
week
i
believe
you
katy
but
can
you
tell
me
who
it
was
i
do
nt
know
but
i
will
find
out
and
before
she
took
her
leave
she
amused
them
very
much
who
played
this
trick
said
she
to
herself
when
she
got
into
the
street
if
i
can
only
find
out
i
will
discharge
her
she
will
bring
the
business
into
contempt
of
course
no
one
would
own
it
and
the
only
way
she
could
find
out
was
by
watching
them
it
must
be
stopped
for
besides
being
too
honest
to
allow
such
deception
katy
saw
that
it
would
spoil
the
trade
when
she
got
home
she
found
a
letter
which
the
penny
post
had
brought
directed
to
her
in
large
schoolboy
hand
it
is
from
tommy
exclaimed
she
eagerly
seizing
the
letter
and
retiring
to
a
corner
to
read
it
you
and
tommy
are
great
friends
said
her
mother
yes
mother
but
do
nt
you
see
it
came
all
the
way
from
liverpool
mrs
redburn
sighed
deeply
at
the
mention
of
her
native
this
evening
while
the
boys
were
reading
and
talking
to
mr
harvey
several
bats
flew
in
at
the
window
john
caught
one
of
them
in
his
hat
and
placed
it
on
the
table
for
his
cousin
to
examine
samuel
asked
his
uncle
if
it
would
not
fly
away
no
said
mr
harvey
it
can
not
raise
itself
from
the
ground
what
we
call
its
wings
are
you
see
nothing
but
two
thin
skins
or
membranes
stretched
from
its
hind
legs
to
its
fore
ones
and
fastened
to
its
sides
when
flying
it
spreads
out
its
toes
so
as
to
unfold
these
membranes
and
thus
balances
itself
in
the
air
do
not
some
people
think
that
the
bat
is
a
bird
never
examined
a
bat
closely
you
see
that
it
looks
nothing
at
all
like
a
bird
father
said
john
where
did
those
great
bats
come
from
which
you
have
in
your
cabinet
from
the
island
of
java
said
mr
harvey
they
are
called
java
bats
i
have
seen
some
with
bodies
as
large
as
hens
and
wings
like
umbrellas
hundreds
of
these
animals
fly
about
the
gardens
and
orchards
of
that
island
every
night
destroying
great
quantities
of
fruit
the
people
there
spread
nets
over
the
trees
to
protect
the
fruit
and
shoot
the
bats
with
guns
as
you
did
the
hawk
i
have
read
in
a
book
of
travels
said
samuel
that
while
persons
are
asleep
these
bats
or
some
other
large
kind
suck
their
blood
is
that
true
sir
no
said
mr
harvey
such
tales
were
long
believed
even
by
writers
on
of
a
monstrous
bat
sucking
the
blood
from
a
man
s
veins
but
all
this
is
now
known
to
be
fabulous
no
kind
of
bat
will
attack
an
animal
as
large
as
itself
nor
enter
a
house
when
there
is
an
abundance
of
fruit
and
insects
in
the
field
shall
we
let
this
bat
go
now
said
john
mr
harvey
said
yes
and
then
john
lifted
it
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
and
threw
it
into
the
air
in
a
moment
it
spread
out
its
thin
wings
and
after
flying
about
the
room
two
or
three
times
passed
out
of
the
window
mr
harvey
told
them
that
although
the
bat
was
so
feeble
when
on
the
ground
yet
its
strength
of
wing
was
greater
than
that
of
any
bird

the
walk
to
the
creek
the
next
day
there
was
a
heavy
thunder
shower
in
the
morning
which
compelled
the
boys
to
stay
in
the
house
and
in
the
afternoon
the
teacher
of
the
academy
he
staid
thomas
with
his
brother
and
cousin
were
told
to
remain
in
the
house
but
the
next
day
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
they
started
early
on
a
ramble
through
the
fields
as
they
passed
close
to
a
farm
house
samuel
saw
a
large
dog
chained
to
a
tree
in
the
yard
it
looked
very
fierce
at
them
as
they
passed
and
then
began
to
growl
and
bark
thomas
told
his
cousin
that
this
dog
had
bitten
several
persons
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
some
of
the
school
boys
had
tried
to
poison
it
but
that
the
farmer
was
careful
always
to
keep
it
chained
so
that
no
body
might
get
a
chance
to
catch
it
in
the
road
about
half
a
mile
further
onward
was
a
fine
stream
of
water
it
began
in
the
hills
and
ran
winding
along
deeper
and
broader
to
a
great
distance
mr
harvey
owned
several
farms
along
this
creek
and
here
thomas
and
john
often
came
in
summer
evenings
to
that
hundreds
of
fish
could
be
seen
sporting
around
the
shores
when
the
boys
reached
this
creek
they
sat
down
under
a
shady
tree
to
watch
the
fishes
and
listen
to
the
songs
of
the
birds
on
the
bushes
that
hung
over
the
water
in
a
short
time
a
number
of
eels
came
from
under
a
large
stone
one
after
the
other
and
after
swimming
about
for
a
little
while
buried
themselves
in
the
mud
samuel
asked
thomas
where
so
many
came
from
they
live
in
the
water
replied
his
cousin
on
a
pleasant
evening
you
can
see
many
more
swimming
among
the
stones
and
the
roots
of
trees
by
the
edge
of
the
creek
but
do
you
know
that
they
sometimes
come
out
of
the
water
and
glide
about
the
meadows
no
said
samuel
do
they
yes
replied
thomas
at
night
you
may
sometimes
see
a
great
many
among
the
grass
one
of
them
going
from
the
little
creek
near
daddy
hall
s
house
toward
the
mill
pond
we
thought
at
first
that
they
were
snakes
and
so
moved
out
of
their
road
but
by
and
by
we
perceived
that
they
were
eels
the
weather
had
been
hot
and
dry
for
two
weeks
before
and
these
eels
were
travelling
to
find
more
water
so
father
told
us
afterwards
the
boys
now
walked
on
down
the
creek
until
they
came
to
a
small
bridge
on
this
a
boy
about
as
large
as
samuel
was
standing
throwing
stones
into
the
water
when
thomas
and
the
other
two
got
near
enough
they
saw
he
was
stoning
frogs
every
time
one
of
these
little
animals
put
its
head
above
the
water
the
boy
pelted
it
with
a
stone
and
two
or
three
had
been
mashed
to
death
as
they
sat
on
the
broad
stones
near
the
water
s
edge
illustration
stoning
frogs
now
all
will
say
that
this
was
a
cruel
boy
and
so
he
was
as
soon
as
john
saw
what
he
was
about
he
called
to
him
to
stop
the
boy
said
he
would
not
and
stoned
harder
than
before
then
john
began
to
grow
angry
you
remember
children
i
told
you
that
though
john
was
a
noble
hearted
fellow
yet
he
was
quick
of
temper
and
when
he
saw
boys
doing
wrong
he
was
apt
to
get
angry
very
soon
if
they
did
not
stop
when
they
were
told
so
seeing
the
capacity
of
the
cylinder
or
vessel
which
the
kindness
of
the
publisher
was
to
furnish
for
containing
it
he
compared
the
lorgnette
in
this
view
with
one
of
the
flashy
novels
of
some
two
hundred
pages
at
two
and
sixpence
and
with
an
enormous
weekly
containing
as
he
said
fourfold
the
matter
for
the
small
sum
of
six
cents
another
bookseller
paper
altogether
too
quiet
for
the
spirit
of
the
day
if
said
he
these
sketches
had
been
written
in
the
style
of
napoleon
and
his
marshals
or
mr
poe
s
works
or
even
of
the
monk
s
revenge
they
would
have
been
in
great
demand
the
public
taste
wants
just
now
high
spicing
a
great
deal
of
ginger
and
mustard
and
if
the
writer
had
ventured
to
be
a
little
more
severe
and
made
personal
attacks
or
even
given
personal
descriptions
like
those
in
the
elegant
summer
correspondence
of
the
express
newspaper
with
dashes
thrown
in
for
vowels
there
would
have
been
no
possible
doubt
of
his
success
another
thing
he
very
kindly
told
me
which
went
much
against
my
letters
was
the
evidently
unbefriended
state
of
the
author
he
does
nt
seem
he
told
me
to
have
secured
the
good
offices
of
a
single
journal
or
to
have
a
good
natured
paragraph
writer
in
the
whole
town
clique
of
course
he
can
sir
these
little
puffs
are
the
making
of
books
now
a
days
as
much
as
advertisements
are
the
making
of
pills
or
bosom
friends
the
making
of
women
the
publisher
might
mend
the
matter
somewhat
if
he
would
enclose
a
curt
little
notice
to
several
of
the
journals
with
a
long
advertisement
or
a
small
bank
note
but
that
is
his
concern
moreover
a
literary
adventurer
as
this
fellow
appears
to
be
is
fair
game
for
the
whole
tribe
of
critics
to
peck
at
and
no
editor
thinks
it
worth
his
while
to
say
a
good
word
for
a
person
that
nobody
knows
good
opinions
are
not
so
cheap
now
a
days
as
to
be
hazarded
without
an
equivalent
either
in
money
or
flattery
if
said
a
publisher
whom
i
happened
to
have
known
in
the
country
this
author
who
seems
to
be
a
handy
fellow
with
his
pen
would
make
up
a
dashing
book
of
travels
in
some
new
country
such
as
the
rocky
mountain
region
or
along
the
would
meet
with
a
fair
sale
and
i
should
not
object
under
suitable
guarantees
to
undertake
the
work
of
publishing
on
my
hinting
that
possibly
the
writer
might
not
be
familiar
with
those
regions
he
answered
that
it
made
but
very
little
difference
that
in
fact
one
half
of
the
more
popular
books
of
travel
just
now
were
made
up
by
persons
who
had
never
visited
the
localities
described
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
make
the
general
features
and
geography
correct
that
in
short
the
universal
gazetteer
and
morse
s
cerrographic
maps
afforded
sufficient
data
for
a
man
of
proper
genius
to
make
a
reputation
in
that
line
the
old
class
of
writers
who
dealt
stupidly
in
facts
he
informed
me
were
now
quite
given
up
and
were
not
worth
consideration
even
the
soberer
subjects
of
history
he
told
me
must
be
re
vamped
in
some
tasty
way
and
all
the
little
tittle
tattle
of
the
times
if
it
could
only
be
seized
hold
of
all
those
leading
political
facts
which
used
to
be
considered
essential
to
the
very
name
of
history
and
he
instanced
in
this
connection
mr
parley
mr
abbott
and
even
prof
frost
who
by
proper
attention
to
this
habit
of
the
popular
mind
had
achieved
immense
reputation
and
what
was
still
more
rare
indeed
almost
unknown
with
the
whole
race
of
american
writers
very
considerable
incomes
a
popular
publisher
of
startling
pamphlets
has
conveyed
to
me
privately
the
suggestion
of
putting
my
periodical
into
more
popular
shape
by
introducing
some
extravagant
diablerie
upon
the
cover
printing
in
blue
and
crimson
and
by
giving
more
details
of
private
life
than
i
have
yet
ventured
upon
and
he
hinted
that
if
it
could
be
made
up
in
the
literary
style
of
a
late
pamphlet
the
rich
men
of
new
york
with
a
little
of
scandal
interspersed
in
what
he
was
pleased
to
term
my
very
readable
style
it
would
be
much
more
to
my
credit
and
he
would
engage
to
take
hands
of
course
my
dear
fritz
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
not
to
be
anxious
to
please
the
booksellers
who
are
so
full
of
their
friendly
suggestions
and
who
are
so
clearly
anxious
to
please
me
but
as
the
gaining
of
a
little
money
is
not
so
much
my
object
as
the
gratification
of
a
curious
desire
i
am
possessed
of
to
say
whatever
my
humor
disposes
me
to
say
in
my
own
way
at
my
own
time
and
at
my
own
length
i
shall
hold
on
very
pertinaciously
to
my
present
system
until
my
letters
are
done
meantime
however
i
would
not
object
to
proposals
coming
from
respectable
publishers
with
suitable
references
for
entering
during
the
summer
upon
a
two
volume
book
of
travels
in
ethiopia
or
along
the
upper
mississippi
a
short
didactic
homily
upon
the
rochester
knockings
unpublished
poems
of
john
milton
by
his
great
grandson
or
astounding
developments
connected
with
the
life
of
q
n
v
ct
r
a
do
not
the
bounty
or
the
literary
acumen
of
most
of
our
town
publishers
not
a
more
charitable
body
of
men
in
their
way
than
our
publishers
and
booksellers
are
to
be
found
in
the
world
and
the
number
of
authors
who
are
maintaining
from
day
to
day
a
subsistence
upon
their
benevolence
is
i
am
told
past
all
computation
it
has
even
been
suggested
by
the
refined
and
elegant
of
our
town
and
the
suggestion
does
even
more
credit
to
their
heads
than
to
their
hearts
that
a
committee
of
the
most
respected
authors
with
dr
griswold
at
their
head
be
named
to
erect
some
suitable
testimonial
saw
the
delicate
print
of
violet
s
fingers
on
the
child
s
neck
it
looked
just
as
if
while
violet
was
shaping
out
the
image
she
had
given
it
a
gentle
pat
with
her
hand
and
had
neglected
to
smooth
the
impression
quite
away
after
to
her
idea
that
the
angels
would
be
as
much
delighted
to
play
with
violet
and
peony
as
she
herself
was
after
all
she
does
look
strangely
like
a
snow
image
i
do
believe
she
is
made
of
snow
a
puff
of
the
west
wind
blew
against
the
snow
child
and
again
she
sparkled
like
a
star
snow
repeated
good
mr
lindsey
drawing
the
reluctant
guest
over
his
hospitable
threshold
no
wonder
she
looks
like
snow
she
is
half
frozen
poor
little
thing
but
a
good
fire
will
put
everything
to
rights
without
further
talk
and
always
with
the
same
best
intentions
this
highly
benevolent
and
common
sensible
individual
led
the
little
white
damsel
drooping
drooping
drooping
more
and
more
out
of
the
frosty
air
and
into
his
comfortable
parlor
a
heidenberg
stove
filled
to
the
brim
with
intensely
burning
anthracite
was
sending
a
bright
gleam
through
the
isinglass
of
its
iron
door
and
causing
the
vase
of
water
on
its
top
to
fume
and
bubble
throughout
the
room
a
thermometer
on
the
wall
farthest
from
the
stove
stood
at
eighty
degrees
the
parlor
was
hung
with
red
curtains
and
covered
with
a
red
carpet
and
looked
just
as
warm
as
it
felt
the
difference
betwixt
the
atmosphere
here
and
the
cold
wintry
twilight
out
of
doors
was
like
stepping
at
once
from
nova
zembla
to
the
hottest
part
of
india
or
from
the
north
pole
into
an
oven
oh
this
was
a
fine
place
for
the
little
white
stranger
the
common
sensible
man
placed
the
snow
child
on
the
hearth
rug
right
in
front
of
the
hissing
and
fuming
stove
now
she
will
be
comfortable
cried
mr
lindsey
rubbing
his
hands
and
looking
about
him
with
the
pleasantest
smile
you
ever
saw
make
yourself
at
home
my
child
sad
sad
and
drooping
looked
the
little
white
maiden
as
she
stood
on
the
hearth
rug
with
the
hot
blast
of
the
stove
striking
through
her
like
a
pestilence
once
she
threw
a
through
its
red
curtains
of
the
snow
covered
roofs
and
the
stars
glimmering
frostily
and
all
the
delicious
intensity
of
the
cold
night
the
bleak
wind
rattled
the
window
panes
as
if
it
were
summoning
her
to
come
forth
but
there
stood
the
snow
child
drooping
before
the
hot
stove
but
the
common
sensible
man
saw
nothing
amiss
come
wife
said
he
let
her
have
a
pair
of
thick
stockings
and
a
woollen
shawl
or
blanket
directly
and
tell
dora
to
give
her
some
warm
supper
as
soon
as
the
milk
boils
you
violet
and
peony
amuse
your
little
friend
she
is
out
of
spirits
you
see
at
finding
herself
in
a
strange
place
for
my
part
i
will
go
around
among
the
neighbors
and
find
out
where
she
belongs
the
mother
meanwhile
had
gone
in
search
of
the
shawl
and
stockings
for
her
own
view
of
the
matter
however
subtle
and
delicate
had
given
way
as
it
always
did
the
remonstrances
of
his
two
children
who
still
kept
murmuring
that
their
little
snow
sister
did
not
love
the
warmth
good
mr
lindsey
took
his
departure
shutting
the
parlor
door
carefully
behind
him
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
sack
over
his
ears
he
emerged
from
the
house
and
had
barely
reached
the
street
gate
when
he
was
recalled
by
the
screams
of
violet
and
peony
and
the
rapping
of
a
thimbled
finger
against
the
parlor
window
husband
husband
cried
his
wife
showing
her
horror
stricken
face
through
the
window
panes
there
is
no
need
of
going
for
the
child
s
parents
we
told
you
so
father
screamed
violet
and
peony
as
he
re
entered
the
parlor
you
would
bring
her
in
and
now
our
poor
dear
beau
ti
ful
little
snow
sister
is
thawed
and
their
own
sweet
little
faces
were
already
dissolved
in
tears
so
that
their
father
seeing
what
strange
things
occasionally
happen
in
this
every
day
world
felt
not
a
little
anxious
lest
his
children
might
be
going
demanded
an
explanation
of
his
wife
she
could
only
reply
that
being
summoned
to
the
parlor
by
the
cries
of
violet
and
peony
she
found
no
trace
of
the
little
white
maiden
unless
it
were
the
remains
of
a
heap
of
snow
which
while
she
was
gazing
at
it
melted
quite
away
upon
the
hearth
rug
and
there
you
see
all
that
is
left
of
it
added
she
pointing
to
a
pool
of
water
in
front
of
the
stove
yes
father
said
violet
looking
reproachfully
at
him
through
her
tears
there
is
all
that
is
left
of
our
dear
little
snow
sister
naughty
father
cried
peony
stamping
his
foot
and
i
shudder
to
say
shaking
his
little
fist
at
the
common
sensible
man
we
told
you
how
it
would
be
what
for
did
you
bring
her
in
and
the
heidenberg
stove
through
the
isinglass
of
its
door
seemed
to
glare
at
good
mr
lindsey
like
a
red
eyed
demon
triumphing
you
will
observe
was
one
of
those
rare
cases
which
yet
will
occasionally
happen
where
common
sense
finds
itself
at
fault
the
remarkable
story
of
the
snow
image
though
to
that
sagacious
class
of
people
to
whom
good
mr
lindsey
belongs
it
may
seem
but
a
childish
affair
is
nevertheless
capable
of
being
moralized
in
various
methods
greatly
for
their
edification
one
of
its
lessons
for
instance
might
be
that
it
behooves
men
and
especially
men
of
benevolence
to
consider
well
what
they
are
about
and
before
acting
on
their
philanthropic
purposes
to
be
quite
sure
that
they
comprehend
the
nature
and
all
the
relations
of
the
business
in
hand
what
has
been
established
as
an
element
of
good
to
one
being
may
prove
absolute
mischief
to
another
even
as
the
their
arms
around
each
other
illustration
frank
and
fanny
in
the
woods
frank
was
very
fond
of
his
sister
seldom
leaving
her
for
any
other
playmate
he
remembered
his
dying
mother
s
charge
she
had
called
both
children
to
her
bed
side
before
her
death
and
placing
fanny
s
hand
in
frank
s
had
said
my
son
in
a
few
hours
you
and
fanny
will
be
motherless
promise
me
that
you
will
try
to
fill
my
place
that
you
will
cherish
and
love
your
sister
with
all
the
care
and
tenderness
of
which
you
are
capable
and
fanny
my
little
darling
you
must
remember
mamma
and
try
never
to
be
peevish
and
fretful
so
that
frank
will
love
to
be
with
you
and
take
care
of
you
and
both
children
to
your
grand
parents
that
you
have
ever
been
and
frank
promised
through
his
sobs
that
he
would
never
neglect
his
gentle
little
sister
he
had
kept
his
promise
faithfully
more
than
a
year
had
now
passed
away
and
very
seldom
had
fanny
known
what
it
was
to
have
her
brother
cross
or
unkind
to
her
frank
was
now
ten
years
old
and
fanny
seven
in
all
the
village
there
were
not
two
happier
or
better
behaved
children
we
will
now
go
back
to
the
pleasant
green
meadows
where
we
left
them
on
their
way
home
fanny
was
looking
very
serious
when
frank
said
are
you
tired
sister
if
you
are
i
will
carry
you
pick
a
back
back
oh
no
i
am
not
one
single
bit
tired
then
what
makes
you
look
so
sober
i
was
wishing
that
i
could
have
one
of
those
little
birds
to
love
and
to
take
care
of
always
i
do
a
dear
little
bird
that
would
know
me
and
turn
his
bright
black
eyes
up
to
me
like
mary
day
s
little
canary
when
she
calls
billy
billy
he
turns
his
yellow
head
first
one
side
then
the
other
and
when
he
sees
her
he
sings
so
sweetly
oh
could
nt
you
get
just
one
of
those
little
birdies
for
me
frank
frank
looked
very
thoughtful
for
a
moment
and
fanny
spoke
again
just
one
you
know
there
are
six
little
ones
i
know
there
are
six
fanny
but
you
heard
how
the
poor
birds
cried
and
scolded
when
i
only
peeped
into
the
nest
and
if
i
took
one
away
what
would
they
do
fanny
thought
an
instant
and
then
said
i
did
not
have
six
mammas
i
only
had
one
and
god
took
my
mamma
away
from
me
and
i
am
sure
the
birds
could
spare
me
one
little
one
spare
my
mamma
when
i
only
had
one
fanny
s
reasoning
seemed
very
correct
to
frank
he
was
not
old
enough
to
explain
the
difference
to
her
so
promising
to
bring
her
one
of
the
birds
he
left
her
and
ran
back
over
the
meadows
while
fanny
kept
on
her
way
home
because
she
knew
her
grandmother
always
expected
them
earlier
on
saturday
afternoons
but
though
she
made
haste
it
was
quite
sundown
when
she
reached
home
the
snow
white
cloth
was
spread
upon
the
table
for
tea
and
sally
was
cutting
the
fresh
rye
bread
as
fanny
entered
the
room
her
grandmother
sat
by
the
little
table
between
the
windows
and
looked
up
to
welcome
fanny
but
missing
frank
she
asked
where
he
was
he
has
gone
back
to
the
woods
grandmother
to
get
then
fanny
hesitated
for
she
remembered
how
often
she
had
been
told
that
it
was
wicked
to
rob
the
bird
s
nest
and
she
had
not
thought
she
felt
ashamed
to
tell
her
grandmother
and
so
she
hurried
through
the
room
and
went
to
the
closet
to
hang
up
her
sun
bonnet
pretty
soon
she
heard
the
garden
gate
swing
to
and
she
ran
out
into
the
back
yard
to
meet
frank
who
was
hurrying
along
with
a
sober
face
very
different
from
his
usual
joyous
expression
he
held
his
cap
together
with
both
hands
and
fanny
s
heart
beat
hard
when
she
heard
the
feeble
plaint
of
the
poor
imprisoned
bird
oh
frank
i
am
so
sorry
were
the
first
words
that
she
said
i
did
not
think
that
it
would
be
stealing
until
i
got
home
and
then
i
was
ashamed
to
tell
grandmother
what
you
had
gone
back
for
oh
i
am
so
sorry
and
so
am
i
said
frank
it
almost
made
me
cry
to
hear
the
poor
birds
fret
so
when
i
took
it
away
one
of
them
flow
close
around
my
from
it
i
hit
my
foot
against
a
stone
and
stumbled
down
and
i
am
afraid
i
hurt
the
bird
all
the
way
across
the
meadow
i
could
hear
the
old
birds
crying
so
sorrowfully
chick
a
dee
dee
dee
and
it
made
my
heart
ache
so
that
i
should
have
carried
it
back
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
oh
dear
i
wish
you
had
it
is
too
late
to
carry
it
back
to
night
and
what
will
grandmother
say
to
us
supposing
we
do
nt
tell
her
to
night
and
to
morrow
morning
we
will
get
up
early
and
carry
it
back
and
then
we
can
tell
her
all
about
it
no
we
ca
nt
do
that
frank
for
to
morrow
is
sunday
and
grandmother
does
not
let
us
go
into
the
woods
on
sunday
oh
what
shall
we
do
frank
now
uncovered
the
bird
and
fanny
took
it
gently
in
her
hand
smoothed
the
glossy
black
head
pleasure
for
the
poor
little
thing
wailed
pitifully
and
looked
so
frightened
out
of
its
dark
hazel
eyes
all
the
time
that
they
had
been
talking
their
grandmother
had
been
standing
at
the
open
window
close
by
them
but
the
vines
hid
her
from
sight
and
they
did
not
know
that
she
was
there
when
they
went
into
the
house
they
did
not
see
her
and
so
they
carried
the
bird
up
stairs
into
fanny
s
room
and
that
she
sat
beside
your
dying
mother
and
soothed
and
comforted
her
but
for
this
good
and
brave
man
she
would
now
have
been
with
her
in
heaven
it
was
only
necessary
to
gain
a
hearing
for
such
words
to
produce
an
influence
on
the
rash
but
not
cruel
men
whom
mr
sinclair
addressed
and
scarcely
half
an
hour
had
passed
since
their
entrance
into
the
room
when
whose
life
they
had
come
to
seek
as
a
proof
of
their
sincerity
they
advised
major
scott
no
longer
to
delay
his
departure
from
the
town
and
some
of
them
volunteered
to
accompany
him
as
a
guard
to
his
country
seat
you
have
saved
my
life
said
captain
percy
as
he
shook
hands
with
mr
sinclair
at
parting
and
you
have
preserved
for
me
all
except
my
duties
for
which
i
can
now
desire
to
live
answered
mr
sinclair
with
emotion
then
turning
to
major
scott
he
added
as
soon
as
you
consider
it
safe
you
will
i
hope
bring
captain
percy
to
visit
us
in
the
mean
time
captain
percy
remember
that
the
stranger
and
the
prisoner
are
a
clergyman
s
especial
care
and
suffer
yourself
to
want
nothing
which
i
can
do
for
you
by
the
by
and
he
took
major
scott
aside
and
whispered
him
give
yourself
no
concern
about
that
my
dear
sir
said
major
scott
he
did
attend
to
it
and
captain
percy
s
drafts
on
his
captor
were
promptly
met
till
he
was
able
to
open
a
communication
with
the
british
commander
in
as
quiet
a
manner
as
possible
major
scott
and
captain
percy
moved
off
from
the
hotel
and
were
met
in
the
suburbs
by
their
volunteer
guard
while
another
party
of
the
men
whom
he
had
thus
saved
from
a
great
crime
attended
mr
sinclair
to
his
home
as
he
entered
the
area
of
the
smouldering
ruins
his
eye
sought
the
object
lately
viewed
with
so
much
horror
he
had
scarcely
glanced
at
it
when
one
of
his
companions
stepped
up
and
disengaged
a
dark
cloak
from
the
noose
already
prepared
for
its
expected
victim
i
knew
no
one
would
steal
it
from
the
gallows
said
the
man
as
he
threw
it
over
his
shoulders
mr
sinclair
smiled
to
think
how
easily
imagination
had
transformed
that
harmless
object
into
the
fair
proportions
of
a
man
nothing
more
was
heard
of
captain
percy
for
weeks
dreary
weeks
to
many
parsonage
who
missed
at
every
turn
the
familiar
step
and
voice
which
had
been
life
s
sweetest
music
to
their
hearts
at
length
mr
sinclair
received
a
note
from
major
scott
announcing
his
own
approaching
departure
to
the
army
on
our
northern
frontier
and
requesting
permission
for
captain
percy
and
himself
to
call
on
mr
and
miss
sinclair
permission
was
given
the
call
was
made
and
they
who
had
met
only
in
scenes
of
terror
and
dismay
amidst
flushing
looks
and
fierce
words
now
greeted
each
other
with
gentlest
courtesy
among
sounds
and
sights
of
peace
the
call
was
succeeded
by
a
visit
of
some
days
and
this
by
one
of
weeks
till
at
last
it
seemed
to
be
understood
that
the
parsonage
was
to
be
the
home
of
captain
percy
while
awaiting
the
exchange
which
major
scott
had
promised
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
expedite
his
society
was
at
the
present
time
peculiarly
pleasing
to
mr
sinclair
who
was
diverted
from
his
own
sad
thoughts
by
the
varied
intelligence
of
the
soldier
and
traveller
in
many
deliverer
without
a
thrill
of
emotion
which
communicated
an
air
of
timidity
to
her
manner
whose
usual
characteristic
was
modest
self
possession
captain
percy
at
thirty
five
had
outlived
the
age
of
sudden
and
violent
passion
but
he
had
not
outlived
that
of
deep
feeling
a
soldier
from
boyhood
he
had
visited
almost
every
clime
and
been
familiar
with
the
beauties
of
almost
every
land
yet
in
this
lovely
and
gentle
girl
whom
he
had
guarded
from
ill
and
whom
he
now
saw
in
all
the
pure
and
tender
associations
of
her
home
blessing
and
blessed
there
was
something
which
touched
his
heart
more
deeply
than
he
liked
to
acknowledge
even
to
himself
again
and
again
when
he
saw
the
soft
varying
color
that
arose
to
her
cheek
at
his
sudden
entrance
or
heard
the
voice
in
which
she
was
addressing
another
sink
into
a
more
subdued
tone
as
she
spoke
to
him
did
he
take
his
hat
and
wander
forth
that
he
might
still
in
solitude
his
bosom
s
triumphant
throb
and
to
be
enthralled
by
one
from
whom
ere
another
day
passed
he
might
be
separated
by
orders
which
would
send
him
thousands
of
miles
away
and
detain
him
perhaps
for
years
if
i
thought
her
feelings
were
really
interested
he
would
say
to
himself
at
other
times
but
nonsense
how
can
i
be
such
a
coxcomb
all
she
can
feel
for
me
is
gratitude
this
last
sentiment
was
echoed
by
mary
sinclair
who
when
self
convicted
of
unusual
emotion
in
captain
percy
s
presence
ever
repeated
it
is
only
gratitude
one
evening
mr
sinclair
retired
after
tea
to
his
study
leaving
his
daughter
and
his
guest
together
he
had
not
been
gone
long
when
a
servant
entered
with
the
letters
and
papers
just
brought
by
the
semi
weekly
mail
which
conveyed
to
the
inhabitants
of
havre
de
grace
news
of
the
important
events
then
daily
transpiring
in
distant
parts
of
the
country
the
only
letter
was
a
somewhat
bulky
one
for
captain
percy
mary
received
the
papers
and
commenced
reading
them
had
she
been
looking
at
him
she
would
have
seen
some
surprise
and
even
a
little
annoyance
in
his
countenance
as
his
eyes
rested
on
the
seals
of
his
dispatch
he
opened
it
and
the
annoyance
deepened
he
read
it
more
than
once
minutes
passed
in
perfect
silence
and
mary
began
to
wonder
what
correspondent
could
so
deeply
interest
him
a
heavy
sigh
made
her
look
up
his
letter
lay
open
on
the
thought
it
was
nt
best
to
say
any
thing
to
him
about
the
plan
till
his
cattle
were
fairly
saved
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
should
rather
see
him
deprived
of
his
last
penny
than
do
a
questionable
act
we
should
never
do
wrong
because
others
have
done
wrong
to
us
there
is
a
differ
between
your
think
and
mine
i
see
mistress
if
they
did
wrong
in
getting
away
harry
s
cattle
so
as
every
body
knows
they
did
then
the
tother
of
that
getting
them
back
again
must
be
right
but
you
need
nt
tell
any
body
what
i
ve
said
mistress
for
they
might
perhaps
have
bill
piper
and
me
up
and
try
to
make
barglary
out
of
it
or
simony
i
do
nt
know
but
the
law
folks
would
call
it
the
breaking
into
a
log
barn
but
hush
somebody
s
coming
it
is
the
doctor
doctor
soper
who
now
entered
was
manners
and
high
pretensions
to
skill
and
knowledge
in
his
profession
though
in
fact
he
was
but
a
quack
and
of
that
most
dangerous
class
too
who
dip
into
books
rather
to
acquire
learned
terms
than
to
study
principles
and
who
consequently
as
often
as
otherwise
are
found
doctoring
to
a
name
which
chance
has
suggested
but
which
has
little
connection
with
the
case
which
is
engaging
their
attention
ah
how
do
you
find
yourself
madam
said
the
doctor
throwing
off
his
dripping
overcoat
and
drawing
up
a
chair
towards
the
head
of
the
patient
s
bed
very
ill
doctor
replied
the
other
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
loss
of
strength
as
yet
as
the
deeply
seated
pain
in
the
chest
which
for
the
last
twenty
four
hours
has
caused
me
great
suffering
though
for
the
last
half
hour
not
so
severe
indeed
madam
well
now
for
diagnostics
your
wrist
madam
if
you
please
said
the
doctor
proceeding
to
feel
the
pulse
of
his
patient
with
an
air
intended
for
a
very
professional
one
tense
frequent
this
pulse
of
yours
madam
showing
great
irritability
your
tongue
now
ay
rubric
dry
and
streaked
usual
prognostics
of
neuralgy
pretty
much
made
up
my
mind
about
your
complaint
coming
along
madam
having
learned
from
your
lad
here
something
of
your
troubles
and
fright
on
losing
your
home
and
i
was
right
i
see
it
is
neuralgy
decidedly
a
neuralgy
what
is
that
doctor
always
happy
to
explain
madam
so
as
to
bring
my
meaning
within
the
comprehension
of
common
minds
neuralgy
madam
is
a
derangement
of
the
nerves
your
disease
precisely
why
i
am
not
at
all
nervous
sir
responded
the
patient
looking
up
in
surprise
you
may
not
think
so
and
then
doctor
i
have
an
intense
inward
fever
persisted
the
other
and
my
lungs
seem
much
affected
nervous
fever
madam
returned
the
doctor
too
wise
to
be
instructed
and
lungs
sympathetically
affected
that
s
all
quiet
and
strengthen
the
nerves
and
all
will
be
right
in
a
short
time
i
shall
prescribe
radix
rhei
in
small
doses
assafoetida
quinine
and
brandy
bitters
of
my
own
preparing
these
with
nourishing
food
as
soon
as
you
can
bear
it
will
speedily
restore
you
madam
having
dealt
out
the
prescribed
medicines
calculated
rather
to
increase
than
check
the
poor
woman
s
malady
which
was
inflammation
of
the
lungs
the
self
satisfied
doctor
swelling
with
his
own
importance
departed
leaving
his
patient
now
to
contend
with
two
evils
instead
of
one
a
dangerous
disease
and
the
more
dangerous
effects
of
a
quack
s
prescription
what
time
is
it
now
barty
as
she
awoke
from
a
troubled
slumber
into
which
she
had
fallen
after
the
doctor
s
departure
why
do
nt
know
exactly
mistress
answered
bart
rousing
himself
from
the
dreamy
abstraction
in
which
he
had
been
indulging
as
he
sat
looking
into
the
decaying
fire
do
nt
know
exactly
but
it
has
got
a
considerable
piece
into
the
night
about
nine
o
clock
guess
may
be
more
nine
o
clock
at
night
and
harry
not
yet
returned
sighed
the
invalid
well
well
i
will
complain
no
more
can
i
do
any
thing
for
you
mistress
asked
her
untutored
attendant
touched
at
the
sad
and
despondent
tone
of
the
other
you
may
bring
me
in
a
pitcher
of
fresh
cold
water
with
some
ice
in
it
if
you
will
barty
replied
the
former
it
seems
to
me
as
if
this
inward
heat
was
consuming
my
vitals
since
i
took
the
step
then
disappeared
with
his
pitcher
and
in
a
few
moments
returned
with
it
filled
with
water
and
several
pieces
of
clear
pure
ice
which
were
heard
dashing
against
its
sides
how
grateful
said
the
sick
woman
as
she
took
from
her
lips
the
wooden
cup
which
had
been
filled
and
handed
her
by
her
attendant
and
from
which
she
had
eagerly
drained
nearly
a
pint
of
the
cooling
beverage
at
a
single
draught
there
now
set
the
pitcher
on
the
table
yonder
and
raise
the
largest
piece
of
ice
up
in
sight
so
as
i
lie
here
i
can
look
at
it
the
mere
sight
of
it
seems
to
do
me
good
another
dreary
hour
rolled
away
in
silence
which
was
broken
only
by
the
restless
motions
and
occasional
suppressed
groans
of
the
invalid
within
and
the
wailing
of
the
winds
and
the
pattering
of
the
rain
against
the
windows
without
when
a
slow
heavy
step
was
heard
coming
up
to
the
house
faintly
exclaimed
the
sick
woman
partially
raising
herself
in
bed
and
gazing
eagerly
towards
the
door
while
her
pain
contracted
features
were
for
the
moment
smoothed
by
the
smile
of
affection
and
pleasure
that
now
broke
over
them
like
the
faint
electric
illumining
of
a
weeping
cloud
the
quick
ears
of
the
afflicted
mother
had
not
deceived
her
the
next
instant
harry
woodburn
entered
the
room
and
with
a
gloomy
abstracted
air
proceeded
to
divest
himself
of
his
wet
coat
and
muddy
boots
without
uttering
a
word
or
bestowing
any
thing
more
mr
jasper
urged
martin
warmly
you
hav
nt
yet
looked
at
the
statements
which
i
am
prepared
to
lay
before
you
feeling
answer
and
that
is
that
i
am
declining
trouble
and
cost
about
that
part
of
the
business
there
can
be
little
question
then
said
martin
his
manner
changing
i
am
to
understand
that
you
do
not
wish
to
join
me
in
this
matter
yes
i
would
like
you
to
understand
that
distinctly
very
well
i
am
sorry
you
refuse
so
advantageous
an
investment
of
money
for
right
sure
am
i
that
no
other
investment
you
can
make
will
turn
out
as
this
would
have
done
but
as
you
have
declined
i
will
not
offer
a
share
in
my
good
fortune
to
any
one
else
but
prosecute
the
work
to
my
own
advantage
i
thought
you
had
nt
the
capital
to
do
that
said
jasper
speaking
with
ill
repressed
eagerness
nor
have
i
coolly
answered
martin
the
proposition
i
was
about
to
make
was
this
an
advance
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
capital
on
your
part
but
this
you
decline
certainly
certainly
i
would
not
have
entertained
it
for
a
moment
exactly
so
i
have
already
inferred
i
will
therefore
as
just
said
retain
this
advantage
in
my
own
hands
but
mr
jasper
i
shall
need
some
help
the
visitor
fixed
his
eyes
keenly
on
the
merchant
as
he
said
this
there
was
a
momentary
pause
then
he
resumed
i
shall
only
want
about
ten
thousand
dollars
though
and
this
you
must
obtain
for
me
martin
do
you
think
i
am
made
of
money
exclaimed
jasper
starting
to
his
feet
and
facing
his
companion
in
the
attitude
and
with
the
expression
of
a
man
who
finding
himself
in
the
presence
of
an
enemy
assumes
the
defensive
oh
no
was
the
quiet
answer
not
made
of
money
but
for
a
particular
friend
you
can
no
doubt
easily
raise
such
a
trifle
as
ten
sir
do
nt
get
excited
about
this
matter
mr
jasper
coolly
returned
martin
whose
name
the
reader
has
probably
recognised
as
that
of
an
agent
employed
by
the
merchant
and
grind
the
lawyer
some
years
before
in
making
investigations
relative
to
the
existence
of
coal
on
certain
lands
not
far
from
reading
pennsylvania
do
nt
get
excited
he
repeated
that
will
do
no
good
i
have
not
come
to
rob
you
i
do
nt
ask
you
to
give
me
ten
thousand
dollars
all
i
want
is
a
loan
for
which
i
will
pledge
good
security
what
kind
of
security
asked
jasper
quickly
security
on
my
lead
mine
pooh
i
would
nt
give
the
snap
of
a
finger
for
such
security
jasper
thrown
off
his
guard
spoke
more
contemptuously
than
was
prudent
an
instant
change
was
visible
in
martin
who
rising
commenced
buttoning
up
his
coat
there
was
about
him
every
sir
said
he
with
a
low
formal
bow
yet
with
his
eyes
fixed
searchingly
in
those
of
the
merchant
martin
jasper
did
not
smile
nor
was
there
in
his
voice
the
slightest
affectation
of
good
feeling
yet
his
manner
and
tone
were
both
decisive
martin
sit
down
again
talk
in
reason
and
i
will
hear
the
man
resumed
his
seat
and
with
his
eyes
still
in
those
of
jasper
said
i
have
talked
in
reason
you
are
worth
so
report
says
not
less
than
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
how
the
first
hundred
thousand
came
is
known
certainly
only
to
one
man
beside
you
and
me
in
procuring
that
large
sum
i
was
a
very
prominent
agent
you
have
already
been
paid
for
your
services
a
dozen
times
over
there
may
be
a
difference
of
opinion
about
this
replied
the
man
boldly
and
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
i
what
of
that
five
thousand
to
three
hundred
thousand
that
you
have
made
by
the
operation
you
are
in
error
martin
said
jasper
with
a
blended
look
of
perplexity
and
distress
i
am
not
worth
the
sum
you
have
mentioned
nothing
like
it
my
losses
during
the
past
six
months
have
been
very
heavy
it
is
your
interest
to
say
this
i
can
credit
as
much
of
it
as
i
please
you
are
insulting
you
presume
on
the
power
a
knowledge
of
my
affairs
has
given
you
i
will
look
for
a
more
honourable
agent
the
next
time
honourable
ha
ha
the
visitor
laughed
in
a
low
guttural
voice
martin
i
will
not
hear
this
from
any
living
man
the
face
of
jasper
was
almost
purple
with
suppressed
anger
go
he
added
leave
my
house
instantly
i
defy
you
scarcely
had
these
words
passed
his
lips
ere
martin
the
street
door
shut
with
a
heavy
reverberating
jar
the
merchant
stood
like
one
bewildered
for
a
few
moments
and
then
as
he
sank
into
a
chair
uttered
a
low
groan
for
a
long
time
he
remained
as
motionless
as
if
sleeping
chapter
xvi
on
leaving
the
house
of
jasper
martin
who
instead
of
having
been
in
the
city
only
a
few
hours
arrived
two
days
previously
took
his
way
to
the
office
of
grind
the
lawyer
he
had
seen
this
individual
already
several
times
and
now
called
on
him
again
by
appointment
the
two
men
on
meeting
exchanged
looks
of
intelligence
did
you
see
him
asked
the
lawyer
as
martin
took
a
proffered
chair
i
saw
him
was
replied
can
you
make
any
thing
out
of
him
i
think
so
he
fights
a
little
hard
but
the
odds
are
against
him
how
much
did
you
ask
him
to
loan
you
ten
thousand
too
sharp
not
a
hit
he
ll
never
miss
such
a
trifle
you
ca
nt
bleed
him
that
deep
said
the
lawyer
ca
nt
i
you
ll
see
i
could
get
twenty
thousand
but
i
m
disposed
to
be
generous
ten
thousand
i
must
and
will
have
and
the
man
laughed
in
a
low
self
satisfied
sinister
chuckle
he
s
able
enough
remarked
grind
so
you
have
told
me
and
if
he
is
able
he
must
pay
i
are
bent
upon
it
i
said
the
tongue
may
surely
speak
since
i
his
inmate
am
and
for
his
vices
while
you
seek
his
virtues
i
ll
proclaim
you
say
the
mouth
embezzles
all
the
fruit
of
your
exertion
but
i
on
this
assembly
call
to
prove
the
base
assertion
the
food
which
you
with
labor
gain
he
too
with
labor
chews
nor
does
he
long
the
food
retain
but
gives
has
resign
d
to
whom
you
may
prefer
he
begs
you
therefore
now
to
find
some
other
treasurer
well
be
it
so
they
all
replied
his
wish
shall
be
obeyed
we
think
the
hands
may
now
be
tried
as
treasurers
in
his
stead
the
hands
with
joy
to
this
agreed
and
all
to
them
was
paid
but
they
the
treasure
kept
indeed
and
no
disbursements
made
once
more
the
clam
rous
members
met
a
lean
and
hungry
throng
when
all
allowed
from
head
to
feet
that
what
they
d
done
was
wrong
to
take
his
office
once
again
the
mouth
they
all
implored
who
soon
accepted
it
and
then
health
was
again
restored
moral
this
tale
for
state
affairs
is
meant
which
we
need
not
discuss
at
present
we
will
be
content
to
find
a
moral
thus
the
mouth
has
claims
of
large
amount
from
arms
legs
feet
and
hands
but
let
them
not
on
that
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
said
a
hare
to
a
tortoise
good
sir
what
a
while
you
have
been
only
crossing
the
way
why
i
really
believe
that
to
go
half
a
mile
you
must
travel
two
nights
and
a
day
i
am
very
contented
the
creature
replied
though
i
walk
but
a
tortoise
s
pace
but
if
you
think
proper
the
point
to
decide
we
will
run
half
a
mile
in
a
race
very
good
said
the
hare
said
the
tortoise
proceed
and
the
fox
shall
decide
who
has
won
then
the
hare
started
off
with
incredible
speed
but
the
tortoise
walk
d
leisurely
on
come
tortoise
friend
tortoise
walk
on
said
the
hare
well
i
shall
stay
here
for
my
dinner
why
twill
take
you
a
month
at
that
rate
to
get
there
then
how
can
you
hope
to
be
winner
but
the
tortoise
could
far
distant
behind
so
the
hare
felt
secured
while
at
leisure
she
fed
and
took
a
sound
nap
when
she
dined
so
at
last
this
slow
walker
came
up
with
the
hare
and
there
fast
asleep
did
he
spy
her
and
he
cunningly
crept
with
such
caution
and
care
that
she
woke
not
although
he
pass
d
by
her
well
now
thought
the
hare
when
she
open
d
her
eyes
for
the
race
and
i
soon
shall
have
done
it
but
who
can
describe
her
chagrin
and
surprise
when
she
found
that
the
tortoise
had
won
it
moral
thus
plain
plodding
people
we
often
shall
find

leave

confident
people

poized
a
full
pail
on
her
head
thus
mused
on
her
prospects
in
life
it
is

let
s
see
i
should
think
that
this
milk
will
procure
one
hundred
good
eggs
or
fourscore

be

some
may

the
most

to
roast

then
there
s
their
barley
how
much
will
they
need
why
they
take
but
one
grain
at
a
time
when
they
feed
so
that
s
a
mere
trifle
now
then
let
us
see
at
a
fair
market
price
how
much
money
there
ll
be
six
shillings

to
prevent
all
mistakes
that
low
price

what
will
that

let
us
tell

just
a

times

will
remain

now
how
shameful
it
is
that
i

reckon
up
as
much
money
as
this
well
there
s
no
use
in
trying
so
let
s
give
a

i
will

twenty

and
it

be
no

twenty

i
am

will
buy
me
a

thirty

eight

if
these
turn
out
well
at
the
