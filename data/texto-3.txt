between
the
gratification
of
her
pride
and
resentment
and
the
pleasure
of
granting
the
suit
which
fitzgerald
was
already
pressing
upon
her
deborah
was
the
only
member
of
either
of
the
two
parties
who
was
quite
satisfied
and
tranquil
but
she
was
determined
as
she
said
not
to
come
so
far
and
spend
so
much
time
and
money
without
having
her
pennyworth
of
pleasure
the
affair
of
the
changeable
had
caused
her
but
a
momentary
vexation
the
only
indications
that
she
remembered
it
were
that
she
had
carefully
refolded
and
restored
it
to
her
trunk
without
one
word
of
comment
and
that
she
never
again
appeared
in
that
ambitious
array
if
ever
a
shadow
obscured
deborah
s
good
nature
it
was
as
fleeting
as
an
april
cloud
the
notice
of
mr
redwood
and
westall
which
they
seemed
proud
of
bestowing
was
a
warrant
for
her
respectability
and
though
the
town
bred
young
ladies
thought
her
quite
terrible
and
their
beaus
pronounced
her
a
monster
the
lovers
of
the
picturesque
admired
her
figure
with
fearless
curiosity
with
her
holiday
work
her
knitting
in
her
hands
she
was
sometimes
seen
surrounded
by
a
group
of
boys
relating
to
them
a
revolutionary
story
with
all
the
animation
of
personal
experience
and
her
little
auditors
for
boys
are
naturally
belligerents
would
warm
with
the
spirit
of
their
fathers
and
long
to
fight
their
battles
o
er
again
she
even
attracted
the
notice
of
the
french
ambassador
who
made
many
inquiries
of
her
in
relation
to
the
mode
of
agriculture
and
domestic
economy
of
our
common
farmers
and
seemed
so
satisfied
of
the
accuracy
and
intelligence
of
her
replies
that
he
condescended
to
record
them
in
his
note
book
but
deborah
s
stable
mind
was
quite
unmoved
by
attention
or
neglect
she
inquired
every
body
s
name
and
learned
something
of
every
body
s
history
she
sometimes
mingled
in
the
crowd
and
took
part
in
the
conversation
and
sometimes
stood
aloof
making
her
own
observations
in
short
she
went
up
and
down
wherever
she
listed
with
good
nature
always
obtained
her
sufferance
and
sometimes
procured
her
attention
and
respect
this
was
the
posture
of
affairs
when
our
female
friends
on
entering
the
parlour
one
morning
in
their
way
to
the
breakfast
room
were
encountered
by
the
armstead
party
miss
campbell
sprang
towards
ellen
exclaiming
while
her
fine
face
witnessed
her
sincerity
my
dear
miss
bruce
i
am
delighted
to
find
you
are
not
gone
from
lebanon
i
should
have
died
with
uncertainty
and
impatience
the
last
five
minutes
but
that
i
most
opportunely
met
my
friend
charles
westall
at
whom
i
have
been
speering
questions
about
you
which
he
answered
as
patiently
as
if
he
had
been
bred
in
the
socratic
school
and
to
do
him
justice
he
asked
as
many
as
he
answered
but
how
comes
it
she
added
hardly
allowing
ellen
time
to
return
the
kind
greetings
of
the
other
members
of
her
party
how
comes
it
that
you
have
not
mentioned
our
meeting
and
the
fortunate
incident
that
broke
the
ice
of
have
thought
of
nothing
else
since
at
least
it
has
given
an
agreeable
hue
to
all
my
other
thoughts
you
hesitate
you
were
too
modest
to
proclaim
your
own
heroism
oh
my
dear
miss
bruce
the
days
are
past
when
one
might
do
good
by
stealth
and
blush
to
find
it
fame
this
is
the
age
of
display
of
publication
however
thanks
to
my
generous
interposition
you
have
lost
nothing
on
this
occasion
by
your
modesty
i
have
told
the
whole
story
to
mr
westall
every
particular
of
it
with
a
suitable
number
of
epithets
and
exclamations
and
have
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
put
all
his
ohs
and
ahs
in
the
right
places
and
with
the
right
emphasis
and
conclude
with
a
just
like
miss
bruce
but
here
she
continued
seeming
at
least
not
to
notice
the
deep
blush
that
suffused
ellen
s
cheeks
here
comes
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
the
beautiful
miss
redwood
and
we
common
mortals
entered
leaning
on
mrs
westall
s
arm
her
father
was
beside
her
captain
fitzgerald
joined
them
as
they
came
into
the
room
and
they
passed
near
the
window
at
which
westall
and
the
ladies
were
standing
fitzgerald
recognised
miss
campbell
in
a
dubious
inquiring
manner
which
expressed
do
we
meet
as
friends
and
her
cold
bow
replied
unequivocally
as
strangers
caroline
turned
towards
westall
your
mother
and
papa
she
said
have
settled
it
that
we
take
our
drive
to
the
shakers
after
breakfast
you
are
no
laggard
and
we
shall
depend
on
your
being
ready
and
do
be
so
good
as
to
get
a
direction
from
miss
bruce
to
aunt
the
elect
lady
your
aunt
the
elect
lady
exclaimed
miss
campbell
no
replied
ellen
quite
unmoved
by
a
stroke
that
was
meant
to
mortify
her
i
have
no
aunt
among
the
shakers
neither
if
i
understand
their
order
is
there
any
elect
lady
said
caroline
it
is
this
miss
allen
s
aunt
that
i
allude
to
perhaps
she
added
still
addressing
westall
you
may
persuade
her
to
go
with
us
as
pioneer
she
must
be
quite
familiar
with
the
curiosities
of
the
place
and
possibly
she
may
favour
us
with
an
introduction
to
some
of
the
gifted
brethren
poor
emily
blushed
and
trembled
as
every
eye
turned
on
her
and
edging
herself
behind
ellen
she
whispered
in
all
simplicity
do
tell
her
i
ca
nt
go
my
dear
emily
miss
redwood
knows
you
can
not
go
afraid
of
being
reclaimed
said
caroline
enjoying
the
confusion
into
which
she
had
thrown
the
simple
girl
never
mind
child
we
shall
do
very
well
without
you
i
will
trust
to
luck
for
a
chance
to
quiz
some
of
the
old
broad
brims
caroline
said
mr
redwood
we
shall
lose
our
places
at
the
breakfast
table
by
this
the
ladies
must
excuse
me
i
have
an
engagement
after
breakfast
miss
redwood
bit
her
lips
with
vexation
and
then
turning
to
captain
fitzgerald
more
deeply
impressed
on
the
heart
for
its
instruction
in
righteousness
a
tablet
of
individual
domestick
and
social
vicissitudes
would
serve
as
a
monument
to
recall
the
past
and
as
a
way
mark
to
direct
the
future
the
record
of
our
adversities
is
not
easily
forgotten
but
when
the
sun
of
mercy
beams
upon
us
we
do
not
always
like
the
israelites
set
up
a
stone
of
remembrance
and
say
hitherto
hath
the
lord
helped
us
our
beloved
minister
has
departed
full
of
days
and
full
of
honour
four
score
and
ten
years
were
appointed
him
he
spoke
to
us
from
the
pulpit
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
dear
to
me
and
his
countenance
ever
restored
the
memory
of
scenes
of
happiness
in
which
his
friendship
had
participated
or
of
affliction
in
which
his
piety
had
administered
consolation
how
majestic
was
his
presence
he
answered
when
he
enforced
the
obligations
of
conscience
and
the
terrours
of
the
law
he
spoke
with
a
power
that
forced
the
guilty
to
tremble
with
what
an
overflowing
fullness
would
his
mind
illustrate
points
which
the
thoughtless
had
deemed
of
minor
importance
in
prayer
his
solemnity
was
so
striking
that
i
think
none
could
listen
to
him
without
revering
that
devotion
by
which
he
was
inspired
i
have
been
peculiarly
impressed
with
this
my
brother
during
the
exciting
events
of
our
recent
war
in
his
humility
for
our
occasional
defeat
his
gratitude
for
deliverances
his
thanksgiving
at
the
result
he
seemed
to
pour
out
his
whole
soul
in
all
that
variety
of
of
the
hosts
of
israel
yet
there
were
some
who
were
fatigued
with
the
length
of
his
orisons
and
others
who
objected
to
the
narrations
which
they
contained
the
nurse
of
my
niece
who
was
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
remarked
that
his
prayers
seemed
principally
intended
to
convey
information
to
the
lord
were
gabriel
on
earth
he
replied
there
would
undoubtedly
be
some
to
object
to
the
strain
of
his
devotion
i
have
heard
our
departed
minister
censured
for
credulity
because
in
one
or
two
instances
he
gave
thanks
for
victory
which
afterwards
proved
a
defeat
but
amid
the
variety
of
rumours
which
during
our
long
war
often
deceived
professed
politicians
how
could
he
be
expected
always
to
discern
between
correct
and
false
information
he
whose
integrity
of
soul
would
render
him
one
of
the
last
to
suspect
others
i
have
recently
heard
also
some
uneasiness
expressed
at
the
length
of
his
sermons
it
seems
that
some
of
our
office
of
an
hour
glass
that
they
can
ascertain
the
moment
when
the
speaker
passes
the
limit
of
sixty
minutes
all
beyond
is
to
them
weariness
and
vanity
they
are
not
indifferent
to
any
other
species
of
gain
but
goodly
pearls
without
price
are
scorned
if
they
are
presented
in
large
numbers
or
in
a
capacious
casket
yet
these
cavillers
are
principally
among
the
younger
part
of
our
auditors
who
have
not
yet
attained
the
piety
of
their
fathers
they
feel
the
winter
s
cold
or
the
summer
s
heat
more
sensibly
than
the
peril
of
their
souls
if
the
stoves
and
the
furs
of
russia
could
be
introduced
into
our
places
of
worship
changing
an
inclement
season
into
the
softness
of
spring
i
fear
that
even
then
they
would
scarcely
listen
without
murmuring
to
a
discourse
of
an
hour
and
a
half
in
length
ah
i
fear
that
days
are
coming
when
sound
doctrine
must
be
stinted
both
in
weight
and
measure
and
when
it
will
be
thought
to
destroy
its
specific
nature
so
that
there
may
yet
be
a
time
when
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
will
be
held
secondary
to
the
vehicle
in
which
it
is
presented
and
men
will
hear
sermons
not
for
the
purpose
of
laying
conscience
open
to
their
power
but
to
employ
the
mind
in
criticism
upon
their
construction
our
aged
pastor
might
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
reflecting
that
he
never
curtailed
the
copiousness
of
his
theme
or
allayed
its
pungency
for
the
accommodation
of
ears
polite
to
me
she
replied
his
performances
were
ever
consistent
with
each
other
and
with
the
holy
dignity
of
one
appointed
to
lead
the
sacramental
host
of
god
s
elect
and
it
has
given
me
great
pleasure
in
my
visits
to
him
during
his
decline
to
perceive
that
his
strenuousness
about
particular
doctrines
had
become
absorbed
in
the
sublimity
of
the
great
plan
of
salvation
while
we
are
ascending
the
hill
of
life
little
obstructions
or
aids
seem
of
great
importance
sun
of
glory
beam
there
the
whole
journey
appears
but
as
one
path
of
light
his
happy
spirit
wondered
where
were
the
obstacles
that
had
impeded
its
course
they
vanished
when
it
sat
so
peacefully
on
the
threshold
of
the
gate
of
heaven
this
i
have
also
observed
my
sister
in
recent
conversation
with
him
undoubtedly
many
of
those
opinions
which
we
now
defend
with
asperity
will
appear
divested
of
importance
when
the
light
of
another
world
shines
upon
them
our
clergyman
seemed
to
gather
gentleness
and
charity
while
he
went
downward
to
the
grave
as
the
sun
sheds
a
more
serene
lustre
when
he
trembles
at
the
gates
of
the
west
i
witnessed
an
affecting
occurrence
of
this
nature
in
the
chamber
of
his
sickness
the
divine
of
a
neighbouring
township
differed
from
him
in
the
interpretation
of
a
particular
doctrine
and
a
dispute
on
this
point
had
been
conducted
with
considerable
acrimony
like
the
strife
between
paul
and
barnabas
it
caused
a
their
friendly
exchange
of
pulpits
had
ceased
a
meeting
between
them
was
effected
by
mr
s
the
young
colleague
and
successor
of
our
departed
guide
they
pressed
each
other
s
hands
and
tears
fell
down
like
rain
brother
said
the
dying
clergyman
raising
himself
on
his
couch
underneath
thee
be
the
everlasting
arms
one
thing
is
needful
i
trust
that
we
both
have
faith
in
our
redeemer
and
shall
dwell
together
eternally
where
one
spirit
of
love
pervadeth
all
those
who
there
have
been
in
my
day
said
miss
sandford
in
the
squeaking
tones
of
antiquated
coquetry
it
was
a
toilsome
process
to
please
a
lady
when
i
was
young
but
times
are
sadly
altered
now
i
dare
say
cain
scolded
his
wife
about
the
degeneracy
of
the
ladies
in
nod
said
lucretia
laughing
lacking
mortals
she
carried
on
her
dangerous
flirtation
with
satan
continued
somerville
no
one
smiled
at
this
speech
for
its
levity
was
offensive
to
those
whose
associations
with
the
bible
were
all
sacred
and
to
henry
osborne
the
irreverence
it
argued
was
peculiarly
painful
anxious
to
interrupt
the
awkward
silence
lucretia
hastily
said
my
uncle
left
the
servants
with
us
but
after
all
it
seems
that
bonnets
and
hats
cover
brains
of
very
similar
formation
for
one
by
one
the
eagerness
of
curiosity
tempted
them
from
us
till
we
were
left
to
the
protection
of
aunt
sandford
and
really
we
have
been
much
frightened
added
grace
i
had
no
idea
the
citizens
of
boston
could
utter
sounds
so
terrific
as
those
we
have
heard
to
night
it
would
be
well
if
their
echo
could
reach
across
the
atlantic
observed
her
brother
and
what
would
be
heard
if
they
did
asked
somerville
liberty
and
property
a
darkening
expression
passed
over
the
fine
face
of
somerville
as
rapidly
as
the
shadows
of
autumnal
clouds
over
the
sunny
brow
of
some
verdant
hill
then
you
said
he
are
among
the
unhappy
men
who
encourage
popular
outrage
and
will
thus
drive
the
mother
country
to
severity
repugnant
to
her
nature
you
talk
sir
as
many
others
do
who
know
nothing
of
the
subject
rejoined
henry
you
mistake
the
unanimous
voice
of
a
free
and
intelligent
people
for
the
factious
zeal
of
a
few
office
seeking
demagogues
and
what
farther
proof
need
we
than
james
otis
the
aaron
of
your
tribes
the
goliath
of
your
hosts
had
his
father
been
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
the
world
would
have
lost
his
fiery
speech
against
writs
of
assistance
as
well
as
his
never
ceasing
clamour
about
taxation
without
representation
that
is
a
common
but
most
unjust
slander
upon
the
character
of
a
generous
and
noble
minded
man
he
is
disgusted
rapacity
for
office
which
distinguishes
some
friends
of
the
administration
but
he
is
too
high
minded
to
place
the
interest
of
his
family
above
that
of
his
country
besides
if
avarice
or
ambition
guides
the
course
of
james
otis
why
is
he
not
a
tory
the
ministry
would
gladly
buy
him
over
on
any
conditions
crystals
would
fetch
the
price
of
diamonds
if
they
were
as
rare
replied
somerville
england
has
quite
too
many
great
men
to
come
and
purchase
in
such
a
market
as
her
colonies
we
have
some
however
that
britain
herself
might
be
proud
to
boast
such
men
as
adams
hawley
quincy
hancock
mayhew
and
otis
would
even
there
obtain
the
influence
and
reputation
which
talents
joined
with
integrity
never
fail
to
procure
from
those
who
can
appreciate
them
stop
now
dear
brother
said
grace
playfully
putting
her
hand
before
his
mouth
governor
hutchinson
is
coming
and
i
can
not
never
agree
the
shadow
of
the
chief
justice
darkened
the
threshold
as
she
finished
speaking
he
bowed
to
the
ladies
with
all
the
parisian
gallantry
that
usually
characterized
his
manner
and
after
warm
congratulations
had
passed
between
him
and
his
nephew
he
inquired
what
news
from
england
nothing
new
to
you
i
imagine
sir
lord
bute
s
ministry
continues
to
keep
the
king
unpopular
among
the
commons
chatham
holds
the
people
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
if
his
demands
for
himself
and
friends
were
not
so
excessively
exorbitant
a
coalition
of
parties
would
no
doubt
be
formed
and
he
would
be
what
he
has
long
desired
to
be
secretary
of
state
and
disposer
general
of
offices
and
the
queen
and
the
young
princes
said
hutchinson
her
popularity
is
unbounded
she
and
her
rosy
children
unite
all
parties
prince
george
is
as
handsome
and
clever
a
scion
as
ever
sprung
from
a
royal
root
the
duke
of
york
is

and
promising

group
and
the
king
is
as
gallant
as
ever
i
suppose
too
much
so
to
leave
three
distressed
damsels
to
guard
a
house
on
such
a
night
as
this
i
fancy
said
lucretia
smiling
nay
said
the
lieutenant
governor
i
will
not
plead
guilty
to
that
charge
i
left
the
servants
with
you
and
i
knew
the
rioters
were
employed
at
a
safe
distance
besides
it
would
have
been
ungenerous
in
me
to
have
deserted
mr
oliver
if
there
was
the
least
chance
of
being
useful
to
him
then
there
is
your
friend
doctor
byles
lucretia
it
behoved
me
to
inquire
about
his
safety
for
we
well
know
that
his
wit
and
his
loyalty
make
him
very
abominable
in
the
eyes
of
this
liberty
mad
race
mr
osborne
frowned
and
grace
looked
more
grave
than
usual
oh
what
a
deal
of
scorn
looks
beautiful
in
the
contempt
and
anger
of
that
lip
said
the
gallant
chief
justice
floor
but
really
mr
osborne
the
scenes
of
this
day
and
night
must
convince
the
most
obstinate
whig
that
the
designs
of
the
popular
party
in
these
colonies
are
altogether
subversive
of
good
government
and
must
eventually
bring
ruin
on
the
people
i
know
not
the
extent
of
your
meaning
when
you
speak
of
the
popular
party
sir
replied
osborne
but
of
one
thing
i
am
very
certain
and
that
is
that
outrages
of
any
kind
have
never
been
incited
and
will
never
be
countenanced
by
such
men
as
adams
quincy
hancock
and
whiting
indeed
it
is
worse
than
foolish
governor
hutchinson
to
trace
the
present
commotions
to
the
party
spirit
of
individuals
the
truth
is
whenever
government
heap
up
combustibles
a
hand
will
always
be
found
ready
to
kindle
them
and
if
it
were
otherwise
they
would
take
fire
spontaneously
and
what
damage
has
been
occasioned
by
the
explosion
at
this
time
inquired
somerville
cousin
oliver
upon
the
waves
of
the
sea
beating
from
one
world
to
another
and
i
should
know
it
by
rason
that
i
myself
was
fighting
and
baiting
gentaly
under
wellington
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
pyrennees
in
one
month
and
the
next
comes
an
order
and
whips
us
off
for
canada
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
among
the
indians
and
the
yankees
who
know
nothing
about
fighting
he
concluded
glancing
his
eye
at
mr
morris
according
to
the
civil
rules
of
said
mrs
sackville
i
am
grieved
at
her
disappointment
though
i
expected
it
oh
do
let
us
go
in
and
see
her
said
julia
we
will
wait
a
moment
my
dear
replied
her
mother
her
little
boy
must
have
told
her
that
we
were
here
and
i
think
she
will
come
out
to
us
she
ll
not
be
right
free
to
come
before
you
said
the
soldier
if
as
i
now
partly
suspect
you
are
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
that
were
so
hospitable
like
to
her
the
man
now
doffed
his
cap
and
stood
with
it
in
his
hand
with
an
expression
of
respect
in
his
manner
far
different
from
the
hostile
air
he
had
at
first
assumed
but
why
not
my
friend
come
before
us
asked
mrs
sackville
i
trust
she
has
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
ashamed
no
thank
god
it
would
be
hard
with
her
other
misfortunes
but
though
a
soldier
s
wife
she
has
an
enlish
spirit
and
a
proud
one
and
she
says
while
she
has
her
health
and
her
hands
she
will
never
be
seen
asking
charity
and
that
destitute
is
her
condition
that
as
she
said
to
day
to
make
her
case
known
to
christian
people
is
asking
charity
of
them
do
mother
let
us
go
now
and
see
her
again
interposed
julia
stop
a
moment
my
love
replied
mrs
sackville
and
then
turning
again
to
the
soldier
you
say
she
is
utterly
destitute
but
when
she
left
us
she
said
she
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
she
spake
the
truth
ma
am
or
what
is
the
same
she
thought
she
did
but
a
little
limb
of
the
old
one
saving
your
presence
my
lady
had
fingered
all
the
poor
cratur
had
been
earning
in
three
years
in
as
many
ah
exclaimed
mr
morris
who
had
been
intently
listening
the
son
of
belial
i
told
you
so
i
knew
the
rascal
had
it
so
dame
barton
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
told
her
but
the
bundle
was
all
tight
and
snug
for
the
little
devil
had
sewed
it
up
again
and
she
did
not
examine
it
till
she
come
to
look
for
the
money
to
pay
the
captain
of
a
schooner
who
had
agreed
to
take
her
down
the
lakes
and
just
think
my
lady
at
that
moment
what
an
overcast
it
was
that
mischief
was
done
said
edward
as
soon
as
he
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
when
you
and
i
julia
left
that
little
wretch
tristy
in
the
wood
i
shall
always
think
we
were
to
blame
for
leaving
him
does
the
poor
woman
asked
mrs
sackville
still
think
of
returning
to
quebec
to
quebec
ah
she
ll
find
her
husband
if
he
is
above
ground
she
is
that
resolute
that
neither
wind
nor
tide
can
turn
her
if
she
was
left
on
a
naked
island
in
mid
ocean
she
would
contrive
to
get
off
from
it
come
children
said
mrs
sackville
we
will
just
leave
your
father
and
uncle
to
finish
their
survey
here
while
we
look
in
upon
our
poor
friend
well
go
on
mother
said
edward
i
will
overtake
you
first
i
must
run
up
to
the
flag
staff
and
get
at
least
a
clover
stalk
for
a
memorial
of
the
gallant
brock
who
is
buried
there
and
i
will
overtake
you
too
mother
said
julia
falling
back
with
edward
the
soldier
s
eye
followed
the
children
god
bless
them
god
bless
them
said
he
that
is
better
than
a
monument
what
is
better
than
a
monument
friend
asked
mrs
sackville
by
an
honest
commendation
of
her
children
the
memory
of
an
innocent
heart
and
a
tear
from
eyes
that
never
cried
for
sin
my
lady
we
soldiers
die
and
are
turned
into
the
turf
but
we
are
honored
in
our
officers
farewell
my
friend
i
wish
you
well
said
mrs
sackville
dropping
a
piece
of
money
into
the
soldier
s
hand
and
then
turned
from
him
while
he
was
still
uttering
his
hearty
god
bless
you
my
lady
julia
hailed
edward
as
he
was
bounding
off
towards
the
flag
staff
and
begged
him
to
stop
for
her
as
she
had
something
private
to
say
to
him
he
laughed
at
her
passion
for
secrets
said
he
could
not
possibly
be
detained
and
at
last
good
naturedly
stopped
to
listen
ned
she
said
i
tell
you
what
i
was
thinking
of
as
it
was
our
fault
you
know
that
poor
mrs
barton
lost
her
money
and
she
little
dick
is
such
a
good
good
natured
little
fellow
i
was
thinking
ned
for
mercy
s
sake
think
a
little
faster
julia
well
i
was
thinking
if
we
could
contrive
some
way
to
have
her
go
down
in
the
boat
with
us
contrive
it
could
not
take
us
long
to
contrive
i
think
we
can
only
ask
papa
you
know
and
all
the
contrivance
in
the
world
will
do
her
no
good
if
he
does
not
think
it
best
but
then
ned
there
is
one
thing
i
would
like
to
propose
to
father
and
mother
if
you
are
willing
to
join
me
do
nt
be
so
round
about
julia
as
if
i
was
the
great
mogul
speak
out
well
then
to
speak
plain
you
know
edward
you
and
i
have
each
of
us
five
dollars
that
papa
gave
us
to
buy
canada
curiosities
with
now
i
think
if
we
were
to
club
quebec
if
the
captains
of
the
boats
are
good
natured
men
and
reasonable
in
their
charges
greatly
relieving
it
would
seem
that
while
his
own
surprise
had
been
anticipated
and
had
consequently
failed
the
enemy
in
their
turn
having
been
deceived
in
its
object
and
in
his
numbers
had
left
too
small
a
force
to
resist
the
impetuous
onset
of
the
young
mohican
this
fact
was
doubly
apparent
by
the
rapid
manner
in
which
the
battle
in
the
forest
rolled
upward
toward
the
village
and
by
an
instant
falling
off
in
the
number
of
their
assailants
who
rushed
to
assist
in
maintaining
the
front
and
as
it
now
proved
to
be
the
principal
point
of
defense
animating
his
followers
by
his
voice
and
his
own
example
hawkeye
then
gave
the
word
to
bear
down
upon
their
foes
the
charge
in
that
rude
species
of
warfare
consisted
merely
in
pushing
from
cover
to
cover
nigher
to
the
enemy
and
in
this
maneuver
he
was
instantly
and
successfully
obeyed
the
hurons
were
compelled
to
withdraw
and
the
scene
of
the
contest
rapidly
changed
from
to
a
spot
where
the
assailed
found
a
thicket
to
rest
upon
here
the
struggle
was
protracted
arduous
and
seemingly
of
doubtful
issue
the
delawares
though
none
of
them
fell
beginning
to
bleed
freely
in
consequence
of
the
disadvantage
at
which
they
were
held
in
this
crisis
hawkeye
found
means
to
get
behind
the
same
tree
as
that
which
served
for
a
cover
to
heyward
most
of
his
own
combatants
being
within
call
a
little
on
his
right
where
they
maintained
rapid
though
fruitless
discharges
on
their
sheltered
enemies
you
are
a
young
man
major
said
the
scout
dropping
the
butt
of
killdeer
to
the
earth
and
leaning
on
the
barrel
a
little
fatigued
with
his
previous
industry
and
it
may
be
your
gift
to
lead
armies
at
some
future
day
ag
in
these
imps
the
mingoes
you
may
here
see
the
philosophy
of
an
indian
fight
it
consists
mainly
in
ready
hand
a
quick
eye
and
a
good
cover
royal
americans
here
in
what
manner
would
you
set
them
to
work
in
this
business
the
bayonet
would
make
a
road
ay
there
is
white
reason
in
what
you
say
but
a
man
must
ask
himself
in
this
wilderness
how
many
lives
he
can
spare
no
horse
continued
the
scout
shaking
his
head
like
one
who
mused
horse
i
am
ashamed
to
say
must
sooner
or
later
decide
these
scrimmages
the
brutes
are
better
than
men
and
to
horse
must
we
come
at
last
put
a
shodden
hoof
on
the
moccasin
of
a
red
skin
and
if
his
rifle
be
once
emptied
he
will
never
stop
to
load
it
again
the
american
forest
admits
of
the
passage
of
horses
there
being
little
underbrush
and
few
tangled
brakes
the
plan
of
hawkeye
is
the
one
which
has
always
proved
the
most
successful
in
the
battles
between
the
whites
and
the
indians
wayne
in
his
celebrated
campaign
on
the
miami
received
causing
his
dragoons
to
wheel
round
his
flanks
the
indians
were
driven
from
their
covers
before
they
had
time
to
load
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
chiefs
who
fought
in
the
battle
of
miami
assured
the
writer
that
the
red
men
could
not
fight
the
warriors
with
long
knives
and
leather
stockings
meaning
the
dragoons
with
their
sabers
and
boots
this
is
a
subject
that
might
better
be
discussed
at
another
time
returned
heyward
shall
we
charge
i
see
no
contradiction
to
the
gifts
of
any
man
in
passing
his
breathing
spells
in
useful
reflections
the
scout
replied
as
to
rush
i
little
relish
such
a
measure
for
a
scalp
or
two
must
be
thrown
away
in
the
attempt
and
yet
he
added
bending
his
head
aside
to
catch
the
sounds
of
the
distant
combat
if
we
are
to
be
of
use
to
uncas
these
knaves
in
our
front
must
be
got
rid
of
then
turning
with
his
indians
in
their
own
language
his
words
were
answered
by
a
shout
and
at
a
given
signal
each
warrior
made
a
swift
movement
around
his
particular
tree
the
sight
of
so
many
dark
bodies
glancing
before
their
eyes
at
the
same
instant
drew
a
hasty
and
consequently
an
ineffectual
fire
from
the
hurons
without
stopping
to
breathe
the
delawares
leaped
in
long
bounds
toward
the
wood
like
so
many
panthers
springing
upon
their
prey
hawkeye
was
in
front
brandishing
his
terrible
rifle
and
animating
his
followers
by
his
example
a
few
of
the
older
and
more
cunning
hurons
who
had
not
been
deceived
by
the
artifice
which
had
been
practiced
to
draw
their
fire
now
made
a
close
and
deadly
discharge
of
their
pieces
and
justified
the
apprehensions
of
the
scout
by
felling
three
of
his
foremost
warriors
but
the
shock
was
insufficient
to
repel
the
impetus
of
the
charge
the
delawares
broke
into
the
cover
with
the
ferocity
of
their
natures
and
swept
away
every
trace
of
resistance
by
the
fury
instant
hand
to
hand
and
then
the
assailed
yielded
ground
rapidly
until
they
reached
the
opposite
margin
of
the
thicket
where
they
clung
to
the
cover
with
the
sort
of
obstinacy
that
is
so
often
witnessed
in
hunted
brutes
at
this
critical
moment
when
the
success
of
the
struggle
was
again
becoming
doubtful
the
crack
of
a
rifle
was
heard
behind
the
hurons
and
a
bullet
came
whizzing
from
among
some
beaver
lodges
which
were
situated
in
the
clearing
in
their
rear
and
was
followed
by
the
fierce
and
appalling
yell
of
the
war
whoop
there
speaks
the
sagamore
shouted
hawkeye
answering
the
cry
with
his
own
stentorian
voice
we
have
them
now
in
face
and
back
the
effect
on
the
hurons
was
instantaneous
discouraged
by
an
assault
from
a
quarter
that
left
them
no
opportunity
for
cover
the
warriors
uttered
a
common
yell
of
disappointment
and
breaking
off
in
a
body
they
spread
themselves
across
the
opening
heedless
of
every
consideration
but
flight
many
and
the
blows
of
the
pursuing
delawares
we
shall
not
pause
to
detail
the
meeting
between
the
scout
of
some
uncovered
corse
he
grew
fainter
and
fainter
a
dead
weight
like
iron
was
on
his
brain
the
remembrance
of
even
his
situation
was
only
created
things
was
nearly
lost
but
once
again
his
faculties
appeared
renewed
and
he
looked
fearfully
from
side
to
side
he
gazed
upon
the
arms
of
a
mighty
tree
that
waved
in
the
wind
above
him
and
by
his
distorting
vision
seemed
tottering
to
a
fall
he
wished
that
the
falling
timber
might
crush
and
release
him
from
his
misery
he
revelled
in
the
thought
for
it
seemed
as
though
connexion
with
the
living
was
broken
and
he
retained
no
human
or
earthly
ties
his
senses
swam
and
his
eyes
now
weakened
to
exhaustion
closed
as
it
were
from
mere
pain
and
then
there
came
a
voice
close
to
his
ear
as
from
the
lips
of
his
comrade
yet
he
scarce
heard
it
for
his
limbs
grew
motionless
stiff
like
with
the
ice
of
death
a
very
slumber
tranquil
and
senseless
was
on
him
when
sudden
a
sound
sharp
and
loud
startled
him
and
he
awoke
the
noise
petrified
his
very
frame
but
although
he
strived
at
when
again
it
was
repeated
such
was
the
joy
and
surprise
that
pervaded
him
that
he
had
almost
relapsed
into
his
former
helplessness
for
it
was
the
report
of
a
gun
followed
by
the
deep
mouthed
baying
of
a
wolf
dog
that
even
in
its
roughness
came
as
sweet
to
his
ears
as
music
to
the
listening
sick
in
an
instant
all
weakness
was
fled
his
intellectual
powers
returned
with
increased
vigour
and
acuteness
and
appeared
to
vie
with
each
other
while
as
he
shouted
every
nerve
trembled
with
agitation
and
fear
lest
the
succour
should
not
be
real
but
a
mere
deception
of
the
sense
and
as
soon
as
the
call
was
echoed
by
the
cheerful
voice
of
man
the
blood
rushed
back
in
a
torrent
to
the
heart
as
with
the
joyful
bound
of
a
stag
and
he
sunk
down
overcome
by
fatigue
and
agitation
thank
heaven
we
are
saved
we
are
saved
burst
joyfully
from
his
lips
as
he
beheld
his
comrades
revived
and
starting
answer
was
twice
repeated
to
his
call
at
a
short
space
of
time
a
large
dog
sprang
through
the
thicket
and
with
fierce
and
malicious
barkings
darted
towards
them
but
his
ferocity
was
soon
soothed
to
silence
by
the
appearance
of
a
savage
looking
man
who
followed
down

down
thou
noisy
hound
said
the
stranger
and
the
animal
passive
and
obedient
ran
fawning
about
him
a
lanthorn
which
the
man
bore
in
one
hand
by
its
strong
yet
transient
gleams
discovered
to
the
party
his
singular
grim
and
haggard
visage
overrun
by
a
grey
and
grisly
beard
which
appeared
to
have
been
long
unshorn
he
was
as
well
as
could
be
distinguished
a
tall
gaunt
bony
figure
with
sinews
and
muscle
that
indicated
almost
gigantic
strength
a
buckskin
hunting
shirt
dressed
with
the
hair
outward
hung
half
way
between
the
hip
and
knee
and
was
tied
round
his
waist
with
a
leathern
thong
his
legs
were
covered
with
stockings
of
blanket
on
his
head
he
wore
a
cap
made
of
the
hide
of
some
wild
animal
but
dyed
of
a
scarlet
colour
after
the
manner
of
the
indian
and
in
one
hand
he
held
a
long
barrelled
spanish
musquetoon
a
hatchet
and
knife
bared
to
the
handle
and
glittering
in
the
red
light
were
stuck
in
the
thong
which
bound
his
garments
he
greeted
the
benighted
and
perishing
travellers
in
a
voice
the
roughness
of
whose
tone
was
strongly
contrasted
with
the
kindness
intended
and
after
a
few
inquiries
of
their
distress
which
was
briefly
conveyed
to
him
as
much
by
their
appearance
as
words
he
proceeded
to
state
that
if
their
strengths
could
support
it
he
would
conduct
them
where
not
many
paces
distant
several
of
his
companions
hunters
who
had
been
bewildered
also
in
the
snow
storm
in
the
far
pursuit
of
game
had
been
enabled
to
build
their
watch
fire
within
the
shelter
of
a
ruined
and
deserted
hut
and
in
their
name
he
offered
a
share
of
the
succour
and
scanty
the
tempest
mustering
up
cheerfully
at
this
speedy
chance
of
relief
their
remaining

they
blessed
him
for
his
proffered
hospitality
and
with
an
activity
scarcely
to
be
expected
from
their
worn
and
weakened
frames
they
hastily
prepared
to

the
observance
of
the
sabbath
began
with
the
puritans
as
it
still
does
night
at
the
going
down
of
the
sun
on
saturday
all
temporal
affairs
were
suspended
and
so
zealously
did
our
fathers
maintain
the
letter
as
well
as
the
spirit
of
the
law
that
according
to
a
vulgar
tradition
in
connecticut
no
beer
was
brewed
in
the
latter
part
of
the
week
lest
it
should
presume
to
work
on
sunday
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
tendency
of
the
age
is
to
laxity
and
so
rapidly
is
the
wholesome
strictness
of
primitive
times
abating
that
should
some
antiquary
fifty
years
hence
in
exploring
his
garret
rubbish
chance
to
cast
his
eye
on
our
humble
pages
he
may
be
surprised
to
learn
that
even
now
the
sabbath
is
observed
in
the
interior
of
new
england
with
an
almost
judaical
severity
on
saturday
afternoon
an
uncommon
bustle
is
apparent
the
great
class
of
procrastinators
are
hurrying
to
and
fro
to
complete
the
lagging
business
of
the
week
the
good
mothers
like
burns
matron
are
plying
their
needles
making
while
the
domestics
or
help
we
prefer
the
national
descriptive
term
are
wielding
with
might
and
main
their
brooms
and
mops
to
make
all
tidy
for
the
sabbath
as
the
day
declines
the
hum
of
labour
dies
away
and
after
the
sun
is
set
perfect
stillness
reigns
in
every
well
ordered
household
and
not
a
foot
fall
is
heard
in
the
village
street
it
can
not
be
denied
that
even
the
most
spiritual
missing
the
excitement
of
their
ordinary
occupations
anticipate
their
usual
bed
time
the
obvious
inference
from
this
fact
is
skilfully
avoided
by
certain
ingenious
reasoners
who
allege
that
the
constitution
was
originally
so
organised
as
to
require
an
extra
quantity
of
sleep
on
every
seventh
night
we
recommend
it
to
the
curious
to
inquire
how
this
peculiarity
was
adjusted
when
the
first
day
of
the
week
was
changed
from
saturday
to
sunday
the
sabbath
morning
is
as
peaceful
as
the
first
hallowed
day

a
human
sound
is
heard
without
the
dwellings
crowing
of
the
cocks
and
the
gossipping
of
the
birds

would
seem
to
be
extinct

at
the
bidding
of
the

going

old
and
young

from
their

and
with
solemn
demeanor

their

family
of
the
minister
the
squire
the
doctor
the
merchants
the
modest
gentry
of
the
village
and
the
mechanic
and
labourer
all
arranged
in
their
best
all
meeting
on
even
ground
and
all
with
that
consciousness
of
independence
and
equality
which
breaks
down
the
pride
of
the
rich
and
rescues
the
poor
from
servility
envy
and
discontent
if
a
morning
salutation
is
reciprocated
it
is
in
a
suppressed
voice
and
if
perchance
nature
in
some
reckless
urchin
burst
forth
in
laughter
my
dear
you
forget
it

sunday
is
the
ever
ready
reproof

face
wears
a
solemn
aspect

we
once
chanced
to
see
even
a
deacon
s
muscles
relaxed
by
in
a
half
deprecating
half
laughing
voice

squire
is
so
droll

a

must
laugh

it
be

farmer

ample
waggon
and
the
little
one

bring
in
all
who
reside
at
an
inconvenient
walking
distance
that
is
to
say
in
our
riding
community
half
a
mile
from
the
church
it
is
a
pleasing
sight
to
those
who
love
to
note
the
happy
peculiarities
of
their
own
land
to
see
the
farmer
s
daughters
blooming
intelligent
and
well
bred
pouring
out
of
these
homely
coaches
with
their
nice
white
gowns
prunel
shoes
leghorn
hats
fans
and
parasols
and
the
spruce
young
men
with
their
plaited
ruffles
blue
coats
and
yellow
buttons
the
whole
community
meet
as
one
religious
family

offer
their
devotions
at
the
common
altar

there
is
an
out
law
from
the
society

luckless
wight
whose
vagrant
taste
has
never
been
subdued

may
be
seen
stealing
along
the
margin
of
some
and
troublesome
admonitions
of
his
fellows
towards
the
close
of
the
day
or
to
borrow
a
phrase
descriptive
of
his
feelings
who
first
used
it
when
the
sabbath
begins
to
abate
the
children
cluster
about
the
windows
their
eyes
wander
from
their
catechisms
to
the
western
sky
and
though
it
seems
to
them
as
if
the
sun
would
never
disappear
his
broad
disk
does
slowly
sink
behind
the
mountain
and
while
his
last
ray
still
lingers
on
the
eastern
summits
merry
voices
break
forth
and
wrapped
her
in
his
cloak
and
assisted
by
his
father
carried
her
in
his
arms
to
the
nearest
habitation
whence
she
was
conveyed
as
soon
as
a

obtained

our
readers
sagacity
has
probably
enabled
them
to
penetrate
the
slight
mystery
in
which
the
circumstances
that
led
to
the
apprehension
of
magawisca
have
been
shrouded
sir
philip
gardiner
after
attending
the
history
of
our
heroine
saw
her
enter
the
burial
place
partly
moved
by
his
desire
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
any
cause
for
her
running
away
from
him
that
might
soothe
his
vanity
and
partly
no
doubt
by
an
irresistible
attraction
towards
her
he
followed
at
a
prudent
distance
till
he
saw
her
meeting
with
magawisca
he
then
secreted
himself
in
the
thicket
of
evergreens
where
he
was
near
enough
to
hear
and
observe
all
that
passed
and
where
as
may
be
remembered
he
narrowly
escaped
being
exposed
by
his
dog
sir
philip
had
heard
the
rumour
of
a
conspiracy
among
the
natives
and
when
he
saw
magawisca
s
extreme
anxiety
to
secure
a
clandestine
interview
with
miss
leslie
the
probable
reason
for
her
secresy
at
once
occurred
to
him
if
he
conjectured
rightly
he
was
in
possession
of
a
secret
that
might
be
of
value
to
the
state
and
of
course
be
made
the
means
of
advancing
him
in
the
favour
of
the
governor
but
might
he
not
risk
incurring
and
thus
forfeit
the
object
of
all
his
present
thoughts
and
actions
he
believed
not
he
saw
that
she
yielded
reluctantly
and
because
she
had
no
alternative
to
magawisca
s
imposition
of
secresy
with
her
romantic
notions
it
was
most
probable
that
she
would
hold
her
promise
inviolate
but
would
she
not
be
bound
in
everlasting
gratitude
to
him
who
by
an
ingenious
manoeuvre
should
without
in
the
least
involving
her
honour
secure
the
recovery
of
her
sister
thus
he
flattered
himself
he
should
in
any
event
obtain
some
advantage
to
miss
leslie
he
would
appear
solely
actuated
by
zeal
for
her
happiness
to
the
governor
by
devotion
to
the
safety
and
welfare
of
the
commonwealth
accordingly
on
the
following
monday
morning
he
solicited
a
private
interview
with
the
magistrates
and
deposed
before
them
that
on
returning
to
his
lodgings
on
saturday
night
he
had
seen
miss
leslie
enter
the
burying
ground
alone
that
believing
she
had
gone
to
visit
some
spot
consecrated
by
the
interment
of
young
lady
he
feared
she
might
forget
in
the
indulgence
of
her
feelings
the
lateness
of
the
hour
he
had
therefore
with
the
intention
of
guarding
her
from
all
harm
without
intruding
on
her
meditations
which
though
manifestly
unseasonable
might
he
thought
tend
to
edifying
by
withdrawing
her
thoughts
from
worldly
objects
followed
her
and
secluded
himself
in
the
copse
of
evergreens
where
to
his
astonishment
he
had
witnessed
her
interview
with
the
indian
woman
the
particulars
of
their
conversation
he
gave
at
length
unfortunately
for
magawisca
sir
philip
s
testimony
coincided
with
the
story
of
a
renegado
indian
formerly
one
of
the
counsellors
and
favourites
of
maintunnomoh
this
savage
stung
by
some
real
or
fancied
wrongs
deserted
his
tribe
and
vowing
revenge
he
repaired
to
boston
and
divulged
to
the
governor
the
secret
hostility
of
his
chief
towards
the
english
which
he
said
had
been
stimulated
to
activity
by
the
old
pequod
chief
and
the
renowned
maiden
the
different
tribes
moved
by
the
eloquence
and
arguments
of
mononotto
were
forming
a
powerful
combination
thus
far
the
treacherous
savage
told
the
truth
but
he
proceeded
to
state
plots
and
underplots
and
artfully
to
exaggerate
the
number
and
power
of
the
tribes
the
magistrates
lent
a
believing
ear
to
the
whole
story
they
were
aware
that
the
narragansetts
ever
since
they
had
witnessed
the
defeat
and
extinction
of
their
ancient
enemies
the
pequods
had
felt
a
secret
dread
and
jealousy
of
the
power
and
encroachments
of
the
english
and
that
they
only
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
manifest
their
hostility
letters
had
been
recently
received
from
the
magistrates
of
connecticut
expressing
their
belief
that
a
general
rising
of
the
indians
was
meditated
all
these
circumstances
combined
to
give
importance
to
sir
philip
s
and
the
indian
s
communications
but
the
governor
felt
the
necessity
of
proceeding
warily
miantunnomoh
had
been
the
faithful
friend
and
ally
of
the
english
he
is
described
by
winthrop
as
a
sagacious
and
subtle
man
who
showed
and
ingenuity
withal
such
a
man
it
was
obviously
the
policy
of
the
english
not
unnecessarily
to
provoke
and
the
governor
hoped
by
getting
possession
of
the
pequod
family
to
obtain
the
key
to
miantunnomoh
s
real
designs
and
to
crush
the
conspiracy
before
it
was
matured
we
have
been
compelled
to
this
digression
in
order
to
explain
the
harsh
reception
and
treatment
of
magawisca
to
account
for
the
zeal
with
which
the
governor
promoted
the
party
to
the
garden
and
for
the
signal
which
guided
the
boat
directly
to
the
pequod
family
and
which
sir
philip
remained
on
the
island
to
give
the
knight
had
now
gotten
very
deep
into
the
councils
and
favour
of
the
magistrates
who
saw
in
him
the
selected
medium
of
a
special
kindness
of
providence
to
them
he
took
good
care
that
all
his
circling
wiles
should
end
in
feigned
religion
smooth
hypocrisy
and
by
addressing
his
arts
to
the
predominant
tastes
and
principles
of
the
honest
men
whom
he
deluded

well
sustained

time

landed
at
baltimore
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
his
voyage
he
prepared
to
go
to
philadelphia
thither
his
baggage
was
immediately
sent
under
the
protection
of
a
passenger
and
countryman
his
money
consisted
in
portuguese
gold
which
in
pursuance
of
advice
he
had
changed
into
bank
notes
he
besought
me
in
pathetic
terms
to
search
out
his
sister
whose
youth
and
poverty
and
ignorance
of
the
language
and
manners
of
the
country
might
expose
her
to
innumerable
hardships
book
and
small
volume
into
my
hand
indicating
by
his
countenance
and
gestures
his
desire
that
i
would
deliver
them
to
his
sister
his
obsequies
being
decently
performed
i
had
leisure
to
reflect
upon
the
change
in
my
condition
which
this
incident
had
produced
in
the
pocket
book
were
found
bills
to
the
amount
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
the
volume
proved
to
be
a
manuscript
written
by
the
elder
lodi
in
italian
and
contained
memoirs
of
the
ducal
house
of
visconti
from
whom
the
writer
believed
himself
to
have
lineally
descended
thus
had
i
arrived
by
an
avenue
so
much
beyond
my
foresight
at
the
possession
of
wealth
the
evil
which
impelled
me
to
the
brink
of
suicide
and
which
was
the
source
though
not
of
all
yet
of
the
larger
portion
of
my
anguish
was
now
removed
what
claims
to
honor
or
to
ease
were
consequent
on
riches
were
by
an
extraordinary
fortune
now
conferred
upon
me
such
for
a
time
were
my
money
was
not
mine
that
it
had
been
received
under
every
sanction
of
fidelity
for
another
s
use
to
retain
it
was
equivalent
to
robbery
the
sister
of
the
deceased
was
the
rightful
claimant
it
was
my
duty
to
search
her
out
and
perform
my
tacit
but
sacred
obligations
by
putting
the
whole
into
her
possession
this
conclusion
was
too
adverse
to
my
wishes
not
to
be
strenuously
combated
i
asked
what
it
was
that
gave
man
the
power
of
ascertaining
the
successor
to
his
property
during
his
life
he
might
transfer
the
actual
possession
but
if
vacant
at
his
death
he
into
whose
hands
accident
should
cast
it
was
the
genuine
proprietor
it
is
true
that
the
law
had
sometimes
otherwise
decreed
but
in
law
there
was
no
validity
further
than
it
was
able
by
investigation
and
punishment
to
enforce
its
decrees
but
would
the
law
extort
this
money
from
me
it
was
rather
by
gesture
than
by
words
that
the
will
remote
inferences
and
vague
conjecture
rather
than
of
explicit
and
unerring
declarations
besides
if
the
lady
were
found
would
not
prudence
dictate
the
reservation
of
her
fortune
to
be
administered
by
me
for
her
benefit
of
this
her
age
and
education
had
disqualified
herself
it
was
sufficient
for
the
maintenance
of
both
she
would
regard
me
as
her
benefactor
and
protector
by
supplying
all
her
wants
and
watching
over
her
safety
without
apprizing
her
of
the
means
by
which
i
shall
be
enabled
to
do
this
i
shall
lay
irresistible
claims
to
her
love
and
her
gratitude
such
were
the
sophistries
by
which
reason
was
seduced
and
my
integrity
annihilated
i
hastened
away
from
my
present
abode
i
easily
traced
the
baggage
of
the
deceased
to
an
inn
and
gained
possession
of
it
it
contained
nothing
but
clothes
and
books
i
then
instituted
the
most
diligent
search
after
the
young
lady
for
a
time
my
exertions
were
fruitless
meanwhile
the
possessor
of
this
house
thought
proper
to
embark
with
for
his
furniture
though
enormous
was
precipitately
paid
by
me
his
servants
were
continued
in
their
former
stations
and
in
the
day
at
which
he
relinquished
the
mansion
i
entered
on
possession
there
was
no
difficulty
in
persuading
the
world
that
welbeck
was
a
personage
of
opulence
and
rank
my
birth
and
previous
adventures
it
was
proper
to
conceal
the
facility
with
which
mankind
are
misled
in
their
estimate
of
characters
their
proneness
to
multiply
inferences
and
conjectures
will
not
be
readily
conceived
by
one
destitute
of
my
experience
my
sudden
appearance
on
the
stage
my
stately
reserve
my
splendid
habitation
and
my
circumspect
deportment
were
sufficient
to
entitle
me
to
homage
the
artifices
that
were
used
to
unveil
the
truth
and
the
guesses
that
were
current
respecting
me
were
adapted
to
gratify
my
ruling
passion
i
did
not
remit
my
diligence
to
discover
the
retreat
of
mademoiselle
lodi
i
found
her
at
length
in
the
family
of
a
kinsman
of
the
captain
under
whose
care
she
had
she
had
already
experienced
the
evils
of
being
protectorless
and
indigent
and
my
seasonable
interference
snatched
her
from
impending
and
less
supportable
ills
i
could
safely
unfold
all
that
i
knew
of
her
brother
s
history
except
the
legacy
which
he
had
left
i
ascribed
the
diligence
with
which
i
had
sought
her
to
his
death
bed
injunctions
and
prevailed
upon
her
to
accept
from
me
the
treatment
which
she
would
have
received
from
her
brother
if
he
had
continued
to
live
and
if
his
power
to
benefit
had
been
equal
to
my
own
though
less
can
be
said
in
praise
of
the
understanding
than
of
the
sensibilities
of
this
woman
she
is
one
whom
no
one
could
refrain
from
loving
though
placed
in
situations
far
less
favorable
to
the
generation
of
that
sentiment
than
mine
in
habits
of
domestic
and
incessant
intercourse
in
the
perpetual
contemplation
of
features
animated
by
boundless
gratitude
and
ineffable
sympathies
it
could
not
be
expected
that
either
she
or
i
should
escape
enchantment
the
poison
me
too
late
i
remembered
that
i
was
already
enslaved
by
inextricable
obligations
it
was
easy
to
have
hidden
this
impediment
from
the
eyes
of
my
companion
but
here
my
integrity
refused
to
yield
i
can
indeed
lay
claim
to
little
merit
on
account
of
this
forbearance
if
there
s
qualities
he
was
more
prone
to
shrink
from
danger
than
encounter
it
and
to
yield
to
the
flood
rather
than
sustain
it
but
it
is
just
to
observe
that
his
anguish
on
the
present
occasion
arose
not
wholly
from
selfish
considerations
his
parents
were
dead
and
two
sisters
were
dependant
on
him
for
support
one
of
these
was
nearly
of
his
own
age
the
other
was
scarcely
emerged
from
childhood
there
was
an
intellectual
as
well
as
a
personal
resemblance
between
my
friend
and
his
sisters
they
possessed
his
physical
infirmities
his
vehement
passions
and
refinements
of
taste
and
the
misery
of
his
condition
was
tenfold
increased
by
reflecting
on
the
feelings
which
would
be
awakened
in
them
by
the
knowledge
of
his
state
and
the
hardships
to
which
the
loss
of
his
succor
would
expose
them
chapter
xxviii
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
release
my
friend
by
the
payment
of
his
debt
but
board
i
could
save
him
from
famine
and
by
suitable
exertions
could
procure
him
lodging
as
convenient
as
the
time
would
admit
i
could
promise
to
console
and
protect
his
sisters
and
by
cheerful
tones
and
frequent
visits
dispel
some
part
of
the
evil
which
encompassed
him
after
the
first
surprise
had
subsided
he
inquired
by
what
accident
this
meeting
had
been
produced
conscious
of
my
incapacity
to
do
him
any
essential
service
and
unwilling
to
make
me
a
partaker
in
his
miseries
he
had
forborne
to
inform
me
of
his
condition
this
assurance
was
listened
to
with
some
wonder
i
showed
him
the
billet
it
had
not
been
written
by
him
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
penmanship
none
but
the
attorney
and
officer
were
apprized
of
his
fate
it
was
obvious
to
conclude
that
this
was
the
interposition
of
some
friend
who
knowing
my
affection
for
carlton
had
taken
this
mysterious
method
of
calling
me
to
his
succor
conjectures
as
to
the
author
and
considerations
i
requested
an
interview
with
the
keeper
and
inquired
how
carlton
could
be
best
accommodated
he
said
that
all
his
rooms
were
full
but
one
which
in
consequence
of
the
dismission
of
three
persons
in
the
morning
had
at
present
but
one
tenant
this
person
had
lately
arrived
was
sick
and
had
with
him
at
this
time
one
of
his
friends
carlton
might
divide
the
chamber
with
this
person
no
doubt
his
consent
would
be
readily
given
though
this
arrangement
being
the
best
must
take
place
whether
he
consented
or
not
this
consent
i
resolved
immediately
to
seek
and
for
that
purpose
desired
to
be
led
to
the
chamber
the
door
of
the
apartment
was
shut
i
knocked
for
admission
it
was
instantly
opened
and
i
entered
the
first
person
who
met
my
view
was
arthur
mervyn
i
started
with
astonishment
mervyn
s
countenance
betrayed
nothing
but
satisfaction
at
the
interview
the
traces
of
fatigue
and
anxiety
gave
place
to
mervyn
was
the
writer
of
the
note
which
i
had
lately
received
to
meet
him
within
these
walls
and
at
this
time
was
the
most
remote
and
undesirable
of
all
contingencies
the
same
hour
had
thus
made
me
acquainted
with
the
kindred
and
unwelcome
fate
of
two
beings
whom
i
most
loved
i
had
scarcely
time
to
return
his
embrace
when
taking
my
hand
he
led
me
to
a
bed
that
stood
in
one
corner
there
was
stretched
upon
it
one
whom
a
second
glance
enabled
me
to
call
by
his
name
though
i
had
never
before
seen
him
the
vivid
portrait
which
mervyn
had
drawn
was
conspicuous
in
the
sunken
and
haggard
visage
before
me
this
face
had
indeed
proportions
and
lines
which
could
never
be
forgotten
or
mistaken
welbeck
when
once
seen
or
described
was
easily
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
mankind
he
had
stronger
motives
than
other
men
for
abstaining
from
guilt
the
difficulty
of
concealment
or
disguise
being
tenfold
greater
in
him
than
in
others
by
reason
upon
him
he
was
pallid
and
emaciated
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
on
my
entrance
he
seemed
to
be
asleep
but
before
i
had
time
to
exchange
glances
with
mervyn
or
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
scene
he
awoke
on
seeing
me
he
started
and
cast
a
look
of
upbraiding
on
my
companion
the
latter
comprehended
his
emotion
and
endeavored
to
appease
him
this
person
said
he
is
my
friend
he
is
likewise
a
physician
and
perceiving
your
state
to
require
medical
assistance
i
ventured
to
send
for
him
welbeck
replied
in
a
contemptuous
and
indignant
tone
thou
mistakest
my
condition
boy
my
disease
lies
deeper
than
his
scrutiny
will
ever
reach
i
had
hoped
thou
wert
gone
thy
importunities
are
well
meant
but
they
aggravate
my
miseries
he
now
rose
from
the
bed
and
continued
in
a
firm
and
resolute
tone
you
are
intruders
into
this
apartment
it
is
mine
and
i
desire
to
be
left
alone
address
he
was
immersed
in
perplexity
at
length
raising
his
eyes
from
the
floor
he
said
my
intentions
are
indeed
honest
and
i
am
grieved
that
i
want
the
power
of
persuasion
tomorrow
perhaps
i
may
reason
more
cogently
with
your
despair
or
your
present
mood
may
be
changed
to
aid
my
own
weakness
i
will
entreat
the
assistance
of
this
friend
these
words
roused
a
new
spirit
in
welbeck
his
confusion
and
anger
increased
his
tongue
faltered
as
he
exclaimed
good
god
what
mean
you
headlong
and
rash
as
you
are
you
will
not
share
with
this
person
your
knowledge
of
me
here
he
checked
himself
conscious
that
the
words
he
had
already
uttered
tended
to
the
very
end
which
he
dreaded
this
consciousness
added
to
the
terror
of
more
ample
disclosures
which
the
simplicity
and
rectitude
of
mervyn
might
prompt
him
to
make
chained
up
his
tongue
and
covered
him
with
dismay
mervyn
was
not
long
in
answering
i
comprehend
your
you
the
truth
to
this
person
your
story
has
already
been
told
whatever
i
have
witnessed
under
your
roof
whatever
i
most
of
those
not
connected
with
my
father
and
his
nephew
i
have
often
related
at
present
therefore
i
shall
omit
all
collateral
and
contemporary
incidents
and
confine
myself
entirely
to
those
connected
with
these
two
persons
my
father
on
the
death
of
his
wife
retired
from
business
and
took
a
house
in
an
airy
and
secluded
situation
his
household
consisted
of
a
housekeeper
and
two
or
three
servants
and
apartments
were
always
open
for
his
son
my
brother
s
temper
grew
more
unmanageable
as
he
increased
in
years
my
father
s
and
discretion
commonly
dictate
he
wished
him
to
acquire
all
possible
advantages
of
education
and
then
to
betake
himself
to
some
liberal
profession
in
which
he
might
obtain
honor
as
well
as
riches
this
sober
scheme
by
no
means
suited
the
restless
temper
of
the
youth
it
was
his
maxim
that
all
restraints
were
unworthy
of
a
lad
of
spirit
and
that
it
was
far
more
wise
to
spend
freely
what
his
father
had
painfully
acquired
than
by
the
same
plodding
and
toilsome
arts
to
add
to
the
heap
i
scarcely
know
how
to
describe
my
feelings
in
relation
to
this
young
man
my
affection
for
him
was
certainly
without
that
tenderness
which
a
good
brother
is
sure
to
excite
i
do
not
remember
a
single
direct
kindness
that
i
ever
received
from
him
but
i
remember
innumerable
ill
offices
and
contempts
still
there
was
some
inexplicable
charm
in
the
mere
tie
of
kindred
which
made
me
more
deplore
his
errors
exult
in
his
talents
rejoice
in
his
success
and
take
a
deeper
interest
as
he
advanced
in
age
i
had
new
cause
for
my
zeal
in
his
behalf
my
father
s
temper
was
easy
and
flexible
my
brother
was
at
once
vehement
and
artful
frank
s
arguments
and
upbraidings
created
in
his
father
an
unnatural
awe
an
apprehension
and
diffidence
in
thwarting
his
wishes
and
giving
advice
which
usually
distinguish
the
filial
character
the
youth
perceived
his
advantages
and
employed
them
in
carrying
every
point
on
which
his
inclination
was
set
for
a
long
time
this
absurd
indulgence
was
shewn
in
allowing
his
son
to
employ
his
time
as
he
pleased
in
refraining
from
all
animadversions
on
his
idleness
and
dissipation
and
supplying
him
with
a
generous
allowance
of
pocket
money
this
allowance
required
now
and
then
to
be
increased
every
year
and
every
month
by
adding
new
sources
of
expense
added
something
to
the
stipend
my
father
s
revenue
was
adequate
to
a
very
splendid
establishment
but
he
was
accustomed
to
live
frugally
and
thought
it
wise
to
add
his
savings
to
the
principal
less
till
at
length
my
brother
s
numerous
excursions
a
french
girl
whom
he
maintained
in
expensive
lodgings
his
horses
dogs
and
friends
consumed
the
whole
of
it
i
never
met
my
brother
but
by
accident
these
interviews
were
for
the
most
part
momentary
either
in
the
street
or
at
my
father
s
house
but
i
was
too
much
interested
in
all
that
befel
him
not
to
make
myself
by
various
means
thoroughly
acquainted
with
his
situation
i
had
no
power
to
remedy
the
evil
as
my
elder
brother
and
as
a
man
he
thought
himself
entitled
to
govern
and
despise
me
he
always
treated
me
as
a
frivolous
girl
with
whom
it
was
waste
of
time
to
converse
and
never
spoke
to
me
at
all
except
to
direct
or
admonish
hence
i
could
do
nothing
but
regret
his
habits
their
consequences
to
himself
it
was
beyond
my
power
to
prevent
for
a
long
time
i
was
totally
unaware
of
the
tendencies
of
this
mode
of
life
would
carry
him
beyond
the
bound
of
vulgar
prudence
or
induce
him
to
encroach
on
those
funds
from
which
his
present
enjoyments
were
derived
i
knew
him
to
be
endowed
with
an
acute
understanding
and
imagined
that
this
would
point
out
with
sufficient
clearness
the
wisdom
of
limiting
his
expenses
to
his
income
in
my
daily
conversations
with
my
father
i
never
voluntarily
introduced
frank
as
our
topic
unless
by
the
harmless
and
trite
questions
of
when
was
he
here
where
has
he
gone
and
the
like
we
met
only
by
accident
at
his
lodgings
when
i
entered
the
room
where
he
was
he
never
thought
of
bestowing
more
than
a
transient
look
on
me
just
to
know
who
it
was
that
approached
circumstances
at
length
however
occurred
which
put
an
end
to
this
state
of
neutrality
i
heard
twice
or
thrice
a
year
from
my
cousin
risberg
one
day
a
letter
arrived
in
which
he
obscurely
intimated
that
the
failure
of
year
had
reduced
him
to
great
distress
my
father
had
always
taught
him
to
regard
himself
as
entitled
to
all
the
privileges
of
a
son
had
sent
him
to
europe
under
express
conditions
of
supplying
him
with
a
reasonable
stipend
till
he
should
come
of
age
at
which
period
it
was
concerted
that
risberg
should
return
and
receive
a
portion
with
me
enabling
him
to
enter
advantageously
on
the
profession
of
the
law
to
which
he
was
now
training
this
stipend
was
far
from
being
extravagant
or
more
than
sufficient
for
the
decent
maintenance
of
a
student
at
the
temple
and
risberg
s
conduct
had
always
been
represented
by
those
under
whose
eye
he
had
been
placed
as
regular
and
exemplary
this
intimation
surprised
me
a
good
deal
i
could
easily
imagine
the
embarrassments
to
which
a
failure
of
this
kind
must
subject
a
generous
spirit
and
thought
it
my
duty
to
remove
them
as
soon
as
possible
i
supposed
that
some
miscarriage
or
delay
had
happened
to
the
money
and
that
my
father
i
hastened
therefore
to
his
house
with
the
opened
letter
i
found
him
alone
and
immediately
showed
him
that
page
of
the
letter
which
related
to
this
affair
i
anxiously
watched
his
looks
while
he
read
it
i
observed
marks
of
great
surprise
in
his
countenance
and
as
soon
as
he
laid
down
the
letter
i
began
to
expatiate
conducted
on
the
justest
principles
at
the
end
of
four
years
our
protector
found
it
expedient
to
make
a
voyage
to
cayenne
his
brother
was
an
extensive
proprietor
in
that
colony
but
his
sudden
death
made
way
for
the
succession
of
our
friend
to
establish
his
claims
his
presence
was
necessary
on
the
spot
he
was
little
qualified
for
arduous
enterprises
and
his
age
demanded
repose
but
his
own
acquisitions
having
been
small
and
being
desirous
of
leaving
us
in
possession
of
competence
he
cheerfully
embarked
meanwhile
my
brother
was
placed
at
a
celebrated
seminary
in
the
pais
de
vaud
and
i
was
sent
to
a
sister
who
resided
at
verona
i
was
at
this
time
fourteen
years
old
one
year
younger
than
my
brother
whom
since
that
period
i
have
neither
heard
of
nor
seen
i
was
for
myself
the
character
of
my
new
friend
was
austere
and
devout
and
there
were
so
many
incongenial
points
between
us
that
but
little
tranquillity
was
enjoyed
under
her
control
the
priest
who
discharged
the
office
of
her
confessor
thought
proper
to
entertain
views
with
regard
to
me
grossly
inconsistent
with
the
sanctity
of
his
profession
he
was
a
man
of
profound
dissimulation
and
masterly
address
his
efforts
however
were
repelled
with
disdain
my
security
against
his
attempts
lay
in
the
uncouthness
and
deformity
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
his
person
and
visage
rather
than
in
the
firmness
of
my
own
principles
the
courtship
of
father
bartoli
the
austerities
of
madame
roselli
the
disgustful
or
insipid
occupations
to
which
i
was
condemned
made
me
impatiently
wish
for
a
change
but
my
father
so
i
will
call
him
had
decreed
that
i
should
remain
under
his
sister
s
guardianship
till
his
return
from
guiana
when
this
would
happen
was
uncertain
events
unforeseer
might
protract
it
for
years
but
it
could
incessantly
preyed
upon
by
discontent
my
solitude
was
loathsome
i
panted
after
liberty
and
friendship
and
the
want
of
these
were
not
recompensed
by
luxury
and
quiet
and
by
the
instructions
in
useful
science
which
i
received
from
bartoli
who
though
detested
as
a
hypocrite
and
lover
was
venerable
as
a
scholar
he
would
fain
have
been
an
abelard
but
it
was
not
his
fate
to
meet
with
an
heloise
two
years
passed
away
in
this
durance
my
miseries
were
exquisite
i
am
almost
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
unhappiness
of
that
time
for
looking
back
upon
it
i
perceive
that
an
equal
period
could
not
have
been
spent
with
more
benefit
for
the
sake
of
being
near
me
bartoli
importunately
offered
his
instructions
he
had
nothing
to
communicate
but
metaphysics
and
geometry
these
were
little
to
my
taste
but
i
could
not
keep
him
at
distance
i
had
no
other
alternative
than
to
endure
him
as
a
lover
or
a
teacher
his
passion
for
science
was
and
both
these
passions
combined
to
make
him
a
sedulous
instructer
he
was
a
disciple
of
the
newest
doctrines
respecting
matter
and
mind
he
denied
the
impenetrability
of
the
first
and
the
immateriality
of
the
second
these
he
endeavored
to
inculcate
upon
me
as
well
as
to
subvert
my
religious
tenets
because
he
delighted
like
all
men
in
transfusing
his
opinions
and
because
he
regarded
my
piety
as
the
only
obstacle
to
his
designs
he
succeeded
in
dissolving
the
spell
of
ignorance
but
not
in
producing
that
kind
of
acquiescence
he
wished
he
had
in
this
respect
to
struggle
not
only
with
my
principles
but
my
weakness
he
might
have
overcome
every
obstacle
but
my
abhorrence
of
deformity
and
age
to
cure
me
of
this
aversion
was
beyond
his
power
my
servitude
grew
daily
more
painful
i
grew
tired
of
chasing
a
comet
to
its
aphelion
and
of
untying
the
knot
of
an
infinite
series
a
change
in
my
condition
became
indispensable
to
my
very
existence
languor
were
at
last
my
perpetual
attendants
madame
roselli
was
alarmed
at
my
condition
the
sources
of
my
inquietude
were
incomprehensible
to
her
the
truth
was
that
i
scarcely
understood
them
myself
and
my
endeavors
to
explain
them
to
my
friend
merely
instilled
into
her
an
opinion
that
i
was
either
lunatic
or
deceitful
she
complained
and
admonished
but
my
disinclination
to
my
usual
employments
would
not
be
conquered
and
my
health
rapidly
declined
a
physician
who
was
called
confessed
that
my
case
was
beyond
his
power
to
understand
but
recommended
as
a
sort
of
desperate
expedient
a
change
of
scene
a
succession
and
variety
of
objects
might
possibly
contribute
to
my
cure
at
this
time
there
arrived
at
verona
lady
d
arcy
an
english
woman
of
fortune
and
rank
and
a
strenuous
catholic
her
husband
had
lately
died
and
in
order
to
divert
her
grief
as
well
as
to
gratify
her
curiosity
in
viewing
the
great
seat
of
her
religion
she
had
come
to
italy
this
means
she
gained
a
knowledge
of
my
person
and
condition
and
kindly
offered
to
take
me
under
her
protection
she
meant
to
traverse
every
part
of
italy
and
was
willing
that
i
should
accompany
her
in
all
her
wanderings
this
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
in
spite
of
the
artifices
and
remonstrances
of
bartoli
my
companion
speedily
contracted
for
me
the
affection
of
a
mother
she
was
without
kindred
of
her
own
religion
having
acquired
her
faith
not
by
inheritance
but
conversion
she
desired
to
abjure
her
native
country
and
to
bind
herself
by
every
social
tie
to
a
people
who
adhered
to
the
same
faith
me
she
promised
to
adopt
as
her
daughter
provided
her
first
impressions
in
my
favor
were
not
belied
by
my
future
deportment
my
principles
were
opposite
to
her
s
but
habit
an
aversion
to
displease
my
friend
my
passion
for
knowledge
which
my
new
condition
enabled
me
to
gratify
all
combined
to
make
me
a
deceiver
but
my
imposture
was
merely
forbearance
to
contradict
and
by
acting
as
she
acted
than
by
open
assent
and
zealous
concurrence
my
new
state
was
on
this
account
not
devoid
the
productions
of
europe
and
the
prejudices
which
infect
us
are
derived
chiefly
from
this
source
these
prejudices
may
be
somewhat
rectified
by
age
and
by
converse
with
the
world
but
they
flourish
in
full
vigor
in
youthful
minds
reared
in
seclusion
and
privacy
and
undisciplined
by
intercourse
with
various
classes
of
mankind
in
me
they
possessed
an
unusual
according
to
foreign
usages
and
my
notions
of
dignity
were
modelled
on
a
scale
which
the
revolution
has
completely
taken
away
i
could
never
forget
that
my
condition
was
that
of
a
peasant
and
in
spite
of
reflection
i
was
the
slave
of
those
sentiments
of
self
contempt
and
humiliation
which
pertain
to
that
condition
elsewhere
through
chimerical
and
visionary
on
the
western
side
of
the
atlantic
my
ambition
of
dignity
and
fortune
grew
out
of
this
supposed
inferiority
of
rank
experience
had
taught
me
how
slender
are
the
genuine
wants
of
a
human
being
and
made
me
estimate
at
their
true
value
the
blessings
of
competence
and
fixed
property
our
fears
are
always
proportioned
to
our
hopes
and
what
is
ardently
desired
appears
when
placed
within
our
reach
to
be
an
illusion
designed
to
torment
us
we
are
inclined
to
question
the
reality
of
that
which
our
foresight
had
never
suggested
as
near
though
our
wishes
had
perpetually
hovered
around
it
when
the
death
of
wilmot
put
his
when
converted
into
land
would
procure
her
and
the
man
whom
her
affection
had
distinguished
a
domain
of
four
or
five
hundred
fertile
acres
my
emotions
i
can
not
describe
many
would
be
less
affected
in
passing
from
a
fisherman
s
hovel
to
the
throne
of
an
opulent
nation
it
so
much
surpassed
the
ordinary
bounds
of
my
foresight
and
even
of
my
wishes
that
for
a
time
i
was
fain
to
think
myself
in
one
of
my
usual
walking
dreams
my
doubts
were
dispelled
only
by
the
repetition
of
the
same
impressions
and
by
the
lapse
of
time
i
gradually
became
familiarized
to
the
change
and
by
frequently
revolving
its
benefits
and
consequences
raised
the
tenor
of
my
ordinary
sensations
to
the
level
as
it
were
of
my
new
condition
from
this
unwonted
height
morton
s
reappearance
had
thrown
us
down
to
our
original
obscurity
but
now
my
old
preceptor
had
started
up
before
me
and
like
my
good
genius
had
brought
with
him
gifts
immeasurable
and
hemisphere
they
occupied
an
elevation
in
the
social
scale
to
which
i
could
scarcely
raise
my
eyes
yet
they
were
now
within
a
short
journey
of
my
dwelling
i
was
going
to
be
ushered
into
their
presence
but
my
privilege
was
not
to
be
circumscribed
by
any
sober
limits
this
heiress
of
opulence
and
splendor
this
child
of
fortune
and
appropriator
of
elegance
and
grace
and
beauty
was
proffered
to
me
as
a
wife
i
reflected
on
the
education
which
i
had
received
from
mr
howard
his
affection
for
me
which
had
been
unlimited
his
relation
to
his
wife
s
daughter
and
the
authority
and
respect
which
that
relation
as
well
as
his
personal
qualities
produced
i
reflected
on
the
futility
of
titular
distinction
on
the
capriciousness
of
wealth
and
its
independence
of
all
real
merit
in
the
possessor
but
still
i
could
not
retain
but
for
a
moment
the
confidence
and
self
respect
which
flowed
from
these
thoughts
i
was
still
nothing
more
than
an
obscure
and
cornfield
and
to
whose
level
it
was
impossible
for
a
being
qualified
and
educated
like
clara
ever
to
descend
you
must
not
imagine
however
that
this
descent
was
desired
by
me
i
was
bound
by
every
tie
of
honor
though
not
of
affection
to
mary
wilmot
incited
by
compassion
and
by
gratitude
i
had
plighted
my
vows
to
her
and
had
formed
no
wish
or
expectation
of
revoking
them
these
vows
were
to
be
completed
in
a
few
months
by
marriage
but
this
event
by
the
unfortunate
though
seasonable
and
equitable
claim
of
morton
was
placed
at
an
uncertain
distance
marriage
while
both
of
us
were
poor
would
be
an
act
of
the
utmost
indiscretion
what
however
was
taken
away
by
morton
might
i
fondly
conceived
be
restored
to
us
by
the
generosity
of
mr
howard
it
was
not
indeed
perfectly
agreeable
to
the
dictates
of
my
pride
to
receive
fortune
as
the
boon
of
any
one
howard
more
as
my
father
than
teacher
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
a
natural
right
to
every
gift
which
was
needful
to
my
happiness
and
which
was
in
his
power
to
bestow
mary
and
her
claims
on
me
were
indeed
unknown
to
my
friend
he
had
no
reason
to
be
particularly
interested
in
her
fate
and
her
claims
interfered
with
those
schemes
which
he
had
apparently
formed
with
relation
to
clara
and
myself
how
i
asked
might
he
regard
her
claims
in
what
light
would
he
consider
that
engagement
of
the
understanding
rather
than
of
the
heart
into
which
i
had
entered
how
far
would
he
esteem
it
proper
to
adhere
to
it
and
what
efforts
might
he
make
to
dissolve
it
various
incidents
had
hindered
me
from
thoroughly
explaining
to
him
my
situation
during
his
short
stay
at
hatfield
but
i
resolved
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
our
next
meeting
and
by
a
frank
disclosure
to
put
an
end
to
all
my
doubts
meanwhile
an
account
of
all
these
events
to
mary
and
impatiently
waited
the
arrival
of
a
letter
the
period
of
my
friend
s
absence
was
nearly
expired
and
the
hourly
expectation
of
his
return
prevented
me
from
visiting
mary
in
person
instead
of
his
coming
however
i
at
length
received
a
letter
from
him
in
these
terms
richmond
nov
i
shall
not
call
on
you
at
hatfield
i
am
weary
of
traversing
hills
and
dales
and
my
detention
in
virginia
being
longer
than
i
expected
shall
go
on
board
a
vessel
in
this
port
bound
for
new
york
contract
in
my
name
with
your
old
friend
for
the
present
accommodation
of
the
girls
me
i
must
make
immediate
preparation
to
embark
as
the
ship
in
which
he
had
engaged
a
passage
would
be
ready
to
depart
in
three
days
this
expedition
was
unexpected
there
was
an
impatience
in
his
manner
when
he
urged
the
necessity
of
despatch
that
excited
my
surprise
when
i
questioned
him
as
to
the
cause
of
this
haste
he
generally
stated
reasons
which
at
that
time
i
could
not
deny
to
be
plausible
but
which
on
the
review
appeared
insufficient
i
suspected
that
the
true
motives
were
concealed
and
believed
that
these
motives
had
some
connexion
with
my
brother
s
destiny
i
now
recollected
that
time
been
imparted
to
me
was
always
accompanied
with
airs
of
reserve
and
mysteriousness
what
had
appeared
sufficiently
explicit
at
the
time
it
was
uttered
i
now
remembered
to
have
been
faltering
and
ambiguous
i
was
resolved
to
remove
my
doubts
by
visiting
the
unfortunate
man
in
his
dungeon
heretofore
the
idea
of
this
visit
had
occurred
to
me
but
the
horrors
of
his
dwelling
place
his
wild
yet
placid
physiognomy
his
neglected
locks
the
fetters
which
constrained
his
limbs
terrible
as
they
were
in
description
how
could
i
endure
to
behold
now
however
that
i
was
preparing
to
take
an
everlasting
farewell
of
my
country
now
that
an
ocean
was
henceforth
to
separate
me
from
him
how
could
i
part
without
an
interview
i
would
examine
his
situation
with
my
own
eyes
i
would
know
whether
the
representations
which
had
been
made
to
me
were
true
perhaps
the
sight
of
the
sister
whom
he
was
wont
to
love
with
a
passion
more
than
fraternal
might
have
an
auspicious
i
waited
to
communicate
it
to
mr
cambridge
i
was
aware
that
without
his
concurrence
i
could
not
hope
to
carry
it
into
execution
and
could
discover
no
objection
to
which
it
was
liable
if
i
had
not
been
deceived
as
to
his
condition
no
inconvenience
could
arise
from
this
proceeding
his
consent
therefore
would
be
the
test
of
his
sincerity
i
seized
this
opportunity
to
state
my
wishes
on
this
head
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
by
the
manner
in
which
my
request
affected
him
after
some
pause
in
which
his
countenance
betrayed
every
mark
of
perplexity
he
said
to
me
why
would
you
pay
this
visit
what
useful
purpose
can
it
serve
we
are
preparing
said
i
to
leave
the
country
forever
what
kind
of
being
should
i
be
to
leave
behind
me
a
brother
in
calamity
without
even
a
parting
interview
indulge
me
for
three
minutes
in
the
sight
of
him
my
heart
will
be
much
easier
after
i
have
looked
at
i
believe
otherwise
the
sight
of
him
would
only
augment
your
distress
without
contributing
in
any
degree
to
his
benefit
i
know
not
that
returned
i
surely
the
sympathy
of
his
sister
proofs
that
her
tenderness
is
as
lively
as
ever
must
be
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
him
at
present
he
must
regard
all
mankind
as
his
enemies
and
calumniators
his
sister
he
probably
conceives
to
partake
in
the
general
infatuation
and
to
join
in
the
cry
of
abhorrence
that
is
raised
against
him
to
be
undeceived
in
this
respect
to
be
assured
that
however
i
may
impute
his
conduct
to
delusion
i
still
retain
all
my
former
affection
for
his
person
and
veneration
for
the
purity
of
his
motives
can
not
but
afford
him
pleasure
when
he
hears
that
i
have
left
the
country
without
even
the
ceremonious
attention
of
a
visit
what
will
he
think
of
me
his
magnanimity
may
hinder
him
from
repining
but
he
will
surely
dear
sir
i
must
pay
this
visit
to
embark
with
you
without
paying
it
will
be
impossible
it
may
be
of
no
service
to
him
but
will
enable
me
to
acquit
myself
of
what
i
can
not
but
esteem
a
duty
besides
continued
i
if
it
be
a
mere
fit
of
insanity
that
has
seized
him
may
not
my
presence
chance
to
have
a
salutary
influence
the
mere
sight
of
me
it
is
not
impossible
may
rectify
his
perceptions
ay
said
my
uncle
with
some
eagerness
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
your
interview
may
have
that
effect
and
for
that
reason
beyond
all
others
would
i
dissuade
you
from
it
i
expressed
my
surprise
at
this
declaration
is
it
not
to
be
desired
that
an
error
so
fatal
as
this
should
be
rectified
i
wonder
at
your
question
reflect
on
the
consequences
of
this
error
has
he
not
destroyed
the
wife
whom
he
loved
enables
him
to
bear
the
remembrance
but
the
belief
that
he
acted
as
his
duty
enjoined
would
you
rashly
bereave
him
of
this
belief
would
you
restore
him
to
himself
and
convince
him
that
he
was
instigated
to
this
dreadful
outrage
by
a
perversion
of
his
organs
or
a
delusion
from
hell
now
his
visions
are
joyous
and
elate
he
conceives
himself
to
have
reached
a
loftier
degree
of
virtue
than
any
other
human
being
the
merit
of
his
sacrifice
is
only
enhanced
in
the
eyes
of
superior
beings
by
the
detestation
that
pursues
him
here
and
the
sufferings
to
which
he
is
condemned
the
belief
that
even
his
sister
has
deserted
him
and
gone
over
to
his
enemies
adds
to
his
sublimity
of
feelings
and
his
confidence
in
divine
approbation
and
future
recompense
let
him
be
undeceived
in
this
respect
and
what
floods
of
despair
and
of
horror
will
overwhelm
him
instead
of
glowing
approbation
and
serene
hope
will
he
not
hate
and
torture
himself
self
violence
or
a
be
expected
to
succeed
i
beseech
you
therefore
to
relinquish
this
scheme
if
you
calmly
reflect
upon
it
you
will
discover
that
your
duty
lies
in
carefully
shunning
him
mr
cambridge
s
reasonings
suggested
views
to
my
understanding
that
had
not
hitherto
occurred
i
could
not
but
admit
their
validity
but
they
showed
in
a
new
light
the
depth
of
that
misfortune
in
which
my
brother
was
plunged
i
was
silent
and
irresolute
presently
lonely
priest
finding
his
heart
daily
warming
toward
him
induced
the
squaw
who
nursed
him
to
take
up
her
abode
in
his
own
wigwam
the
indians
called
him
otoolpha
the
son
of
the
stranger
and
seemed
to
regard
the
adopted
one
with
quite
as
much
interest
as
their
own
offspring
not
a
year
after
otoolpha
and
his
nurse
were
domesticated
in
the
dwelling
of
the
jesuit
some
of
the
tribe
on
their
return
from
canada
found
a
nearly
famished
female
infant
in
the
wood
had
not
sebastian
rall
been
of
the
party
its
sufferings
would
probably
have
met
a
violent
end
but
at
his
suggestion
comfortable
nourishment
and
such
care
as
they
could
give
it
were
afforded
a
nose
slightly
approaching
to
aquiline
and
a
complexion
less
darkly
colored
than
usual
betrayed
an
origin
half
european
but
as
her
parentage
and
tribe
were
unknown
they
gave
her
the
emphatic
engrafted
her
on
the
tree
of
abnakis
from
the
first
dawn
of
reason
she
gave
indications
of
an
impetuous
fearless
and
romantic
spirit
the
squaw
who
nursed
her
together
with
the
little
otoolpha
tried
in
vain
to
curb
her
roving
propensities
at
four
and
five
years
old
she
would
frequently
be
absent
several
days
accompanied
by
her
foster
brother
the
duties
of
the
missionary
often
called
him
far
from
home
and
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
him
always
to
watch
over
them
either
in
kindness
or
authority
their
long
excursions
during
his
absence
at
first
occasioned
many
anxious
and
wretched
thoughts
but
when
he
found
his
wayward
protgs
invariably
returned
and
when
he
saw
they
could
cross
streams
leap
ditches
and
thread
their
way
through
the
labyrinths
of
the
wilderness
with
the
boldness
and
sagacity
of
young
hunters
he
ceased
to
disturb
himself
on
their
account
during
the
whole
of
their
adventurous
childhood
but
one
accident
ever
happened
to
them
they
had
been
at
the
english
settlement
to
and
on
their
return
they
took
a
fancy
to
cross
the
kennebec
when
recent
rains
had
swollen
its
deep
and
beautiful
waters
saupoolah
s
life
nearly
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
rapidity
of
the
current
but
her
foster
brother
ran
with
the
speed
of
lightning
to
call
assistance
from
the
village
they
had
just
left
a
muscular
kind
hearted
woman
by
the
name
of
allan
lived
in
a
log
house
very
near
the
river
in
the
midst
of
his
terror
otoolpha
remembered
this
circumstance
and
went
there
for
succor
his
frightened
looks
told
his
story
even
more
plainly
than
his
hurried
exclamation
ogh
saupoolah
die
the
great
spirit
drink
her
up
mrs
allan
saved
the
indian
child
at
the
risk
of
her
own
life
dried
her
clothes
gave
them
something
warm
and
comfortable
to
eat
and
conducted
them
into
their
homeward
path
in
safety
to
this
woman
and
her
children
otoolpha
and
saupoolah
ever
after
clung
with
singular
intensity
of
affection
during
their
childish
with
berries
for
her
little
ones
whom
they
always
chose
to
feed
with
their
own
hands
watching
every
morsel
of
the
fruit
as
it
disappeared
between
their
rosy
lips
with
the
most
animated
expressions
of
delight
and
when
they
arrived
at
maturer
years
they
used
the
great
influence
they
had
with
the
tribe
to
protect
mrs
allan
from
a
thousand
petty
wrongs
and
insults
with
which
her
white
brethren
were
not
unfrequently
visited
educated
by
the
learned
priest
as
far
as
such
fetterless
souls
could
be
educated
and
associating
only
with
savages
these
extraordinary
young
people
grew
up
with
a
strange
mixture
of
european
and
aboriginal
character
both
had
the
rapid
elastic
tread
of
indians
but
the
outlines
of
their
tall
erect
figures
possessed
something
of
the
pliant
gracefulness
of
france
when
indignant
the
expression
of
their
eyes
was
like
light
from
a
burning
glass
but
in
softer
moments
they
had
a
melting
glance
which
belongs
only
to
a
civilized
and
voluptuous
land
saupoolah
s
hair
though
remarkably
soft
and
otoolpha
s
was
brown
and
when
moistened
by
exercise
it
sometimes
curled
slightly
around
his
high
prominent
forehead
the
same
mixture
of
nations
was
shown
in
their
costume
as
in
their
personal
appearance
otoolpha
usually
wore
a
brown
cloth
tunic
with
tight
sleeves
and
large
buttons
under
which
appeared
a
scarlet
kilt
falling
to
his
knees
in
heavy
folds
edged
with
the
fur
of
the
silver
fox
and
fastened
at
the
waist
by
a
broad
girdle
richly
ornamented
with
indian
hieroglyphics
a
coronet
of
scarlet
dyed
fur
to
which
were
fastened
four
silver
bells
gave
indication
of
his
noble
descent
and
from
his
neck
were
suspended
a
cross
and
rosary
of
sandal
wood
which
sebastian
rall
declared
to
have
been
sanctified
by
the
blessed
touch
of
innocent
the
eleventh
saupoolah
s
dress
was
nearly
similar
her
tunic
was
deep
yellow
and
her
scarlet
kilt
touched
the
fur
edge
of
her
high
closely
fitted
and
very
gaudy
moccasins
her
cap
was
not
shaped
unlike
a
bishop
s
surmounted
by
the
black
feathers
of
three
eagles
her
own
arrow
had
slain
in
the
chase
she
was
as
eager
and
keen
eyed
as
otoolpha
it
was
a
noble
sight
to
see
them
equipped
for
the
chase
bounding
along
through
the
forest
the
healthful
and
rapid
blood
coursing
beneath
their
smooth
brown
cheeks
gave
a
richness
and
vividness
of
beauty
which
a
fair
transparent
complexion
can
never
boast
and
their
motions
had
that
graceful
elasticity
produced
only
by
activity
unconsciousness
and
freedom
sebastian
rall
had
been
several
years
at
rome
in
the
service
of
the
pope
and
had
there
acquired
a
refinement
of
taste
uncommon
at
that
early
period
his
adopted
children
sometimes
accompanied
him
on
his
missionary
expeditions
to
canada
and
elsewhere
on
which
occasions
the
game
they
killed
served
for
his
support
when
he
saw
them
with
their
dark
eyes
fixed
on
a
distant
bird
arrows
ready
for
flight
their
majestic
figures
slightly
bending
backward
resting
on
one
knee
with
an
advancing
foot
firmly
fixed
of
the
limb
outlines
most
gracefully
curved
he
gazed
upon
them
with
uncontrolled
delight
and
he
breath
nay
nay
do
nt
look
at
me
so
i
can
not
bear
it
look
at
thee
my
poor
bewildered
sister
how
can
thee
tell
whether
i
am
looking
at
thee
or
not
while
thy
head
is
there
get
up
get
up
i
say
i
do
not
like
that
posture
it
betokens
too
much
fear
the
fear
not
of
death
but
a
lowliness
the
cause
whereof
i
tremble
to
ask
thee
get
up
elizabeth
get
up
if
thee
do
not
mean
to
raise
a
grief
and
a
trouble
in
my
heart
which
i
would
nt
have
there
now
for
the
whole
world
get
up
i
beseech
thee
mary
elizabeth
dyer
elizabeth
got
up
and
after
standing
for
a
moment
or
two
without
being
able
to
utter
a
word
though
her
lips
moved
fell
once
more
upon
her
sister
s
neck
and
laying
her
mouth
close
to
her
ear
while
her
innocent
face
glowed
with
shame
and
her
whole
body
shook
with
fear
whispered
i
pray
thee
rachel
dear
rachel
do
do
let
me
see
him
for
a
minute
or
two
before
they
put
him
to
death
rachel
dyer
made
no
reply
she
could
not
speak
she
had
no
voice
for
speech
but
gathering
up
the
sweet
girl
into
her
bosom
with
a
convulsive
sob
she
wept
for
a
long
while
upon
her
neck
they
were
interrupted
burroughs
the
wizard
having
desired
much
to
see
rachel
dyer
and
mary
elizabeth
dyer
the
confederate
witches
before
his
and
their
death
he
had
been
permitted
by
the
honorable
and
merciful
judges
to
do
so
on
condition
that
he
should
be
doubly
ironed
at
the
wrist
wherefore
he
the
jailor
had
now
come
to
fetch
her
the
said
rachel
to
him
the
said
george
i
am
to
go
too
said
elizabeth
pressing
up
to
the
side
of
her
sister
and
clinging
to
her
with
a
look
of
dismay
no
no
said
he

a
separation
like
that
of
death
followed
no
hope
had
the
two
sisters
of
meeting
again
alive
they
were
afraid
each
for
the
other
and
elizabeth
sat
unable
to
speak
with
her
large
clear
eyes
turned
up
to
the
eyes
of
rachel
as
if
to
implore
with
a
last
look
a
devout
consideration
of
a
dying
prayer
if
it
may
be
said
rachel
turning
her
head
at
the
door
if
it
may
be

maiden

i
do
pray
thee
my
dear
sister

fell
upon
her
sister

neck
and
prayed
her
not
to
leave
her
i
must
leave
thee

george
burroughs
at

point

of
what

in
the
extremity
of
our
sorrow
but
others
may
he
and
thee

elizabeth
and
who
knows
but
after
the
first
shock
of
this
thy
approaching
bereavement
is
over
thee
may
come
to
regard
this
very
trial
with
joy
though
we
are
torn
by
it
as
by
the
agony
of
death
now
let
us
pray
the
sisters
now
prayed
together
for
a
little
time
each
with
her
arm
about
the
other
s
neck
interchanged
a
farewell
kiss
and
parted
parted
forever
and
rachel
was
then
led
to
the
dungeons
below
where
she
saw
him
that
her
sister
loved
and
that
a
score
of
other
very
natures
for
they
were
bred
up
in
fear
of
the
dark
savage
he
sat
with
his
hands
locked
in
his
lap
and
chained
and
rivetted
with
iron
his
brow
gathered
his
teeth
set
and
his
keen
eyes
fixed
upon
the
door
there
is
yet
one
hope
my
dear
friend
whispered
he
after
they
had
been
together
a
good
while
without
speaking
a
word
or
daring
to
look
at
each
other
one
hope
laying
his
pinioned
arm
lightly
upon
her
shoulder
and
pressing
up
to
her
side
with
all
the
affectionate
seriousness
of
a
brother
one
hope
dear
rachel
she
shut
her
eyes
and
large
drops
ran
down
her
cheeks
one
hope
and
but
one
have
a
care
george
burroughs
i
would
not
have
thee
betray
thyself
anew
there
is
no
hope
it
is
not
for
myself
i
speak
there
is
no
hope
for
me
i
know
that
i
feel
that
i
am
sure
of
it
nor
to
tell
you
the
truth
am
even
as
you
are
so
am
i
weary
of
this
world
sick
and
weary
of
life
her
head
sunk
upon
his
shoulder
and
her
breathing
was
that
of
one
who
struggles
with
deep
emotion
no
no
it
is
not
for
myself
that
i
speak
it
is
for
you
for
me
for
you
and
for
elizabeth
for
me
and
for
elizabeth
well
and
if
i
could
bring
you
to
do
what
i
am
persuaded
you
both
may
do
without
reproach
there
would
be
hope
still
for
for
elizabeth
and
for
you
for
elizabeth
and
for
me
o
george

what
hope
is
there

she
stopped
with
a
shudder
i
too
am
tired
of
life
she
withdrew
the
the
evening
of
the
day
in
which
the
events
just
related
took
place
a
miss
blakeney
a
very
amiable
girl
under
the
protection
of
the
rev
mr
matthews
who
with
his
wife
and
her
sister
the
honourable
mrs
cavendish
and
two
young
ladies
to

are
a
charming
family
i
wish
my

health
would
permit
my
bringing
you
acquainted
with
them

is
impossible
said
his
mother
sighing
for
besides
that
the
health
of
your
dear
father
is
in
a
very
precarious
state
i
fear
that
he

something

at
his
heart

within
the
last
few
months
his
rest
is
disturbed
and
indeed
it
is
only
by
powerful
opiates
that
he
obtains
any
and
by
them
alone
the
smallest
exhiliration
of
spirits
his
wound
is
no
doubt
very
painful
my
dear
madam
replied
the
son
but
we
will
hope
that
change
of
scene
and
strict
attention
to
the
advice
of
the
medical
gentlemen
who
attend
him
will
in
time
restore
him
at
that
moment
the
colonel
s
bell
summoned
his
servant
and
the
mother
of
franklin
flew
to
the
apartment
of
her
husband
to
strive
to
alleviate
his
sufferings
by
her
tenderness
and
cheer
him
by
her
said
the
colonel
when
that
faintness
seized
me
at
the
library
near
the
stiene
my
dear
do
you
not
recollect
the
interesting
girl
who
presented
her
smelling
bottle
the
colonel
put
his
hand
to
his
head
spoke
a
few
words
in
an
under
voice
and
leaning
back
on
a
sofa
on
which
he
was
seated
closed
his
eyes
and
his
wife
continuing
silent
he
dropped
into
a
perturbed
slumber
we
will
return
to
london
said
he
on
awaking
we
will
set
off
to
morrow
and
then
make
an
excursion
to
margate
and
ramsgate
from
thence
to
bellevue
where
we
will
finish
the
summer
why
not
go
to
your
sister
s
for
a
few
weeks
she
will
be
much
disappointed
if
we
do
not
make
her
a
visit
this
season
what
to
hampshire
no
no
i
can
not
go
to
hampshire
the
next
morning
mr
franklin
having
breakfasted
with
and
taken
leave
of
his
parents
they
three
days
in
the
vain
hope
that
another
place
would
contribute
to
restore
the
health
and
spirits
of
the
colonel
as
the
delicacy
of
every
member
of
mr
matthew
s
family
forbade
the
smallest
recurrence
to
the
rencontre
in
the
library
with
the
invalid
officer
who
they
had
learnt
was
the
father
of
lieutenant
franklin
when
two
days
after
he
mentioned
the
departure
of
his
parents
from
brighton
no
remark
was
made
but
the
kind
wish
offered
that
his
health
might
soon
be
restored
the
officers
upon
duty
at
brighton
having
received
many
civilities
from
numerous
families
of
distinction
temporary
residents
there
determined
as
it
drew
near
the
close
of
the
season
to
give
a
splendid
ball
mr
matthews
family
were
among
the
invited
guests
lady
mary
was
wild
with
delight
even
lucy
felt
somewhat
exhilirated
at
the
idea
of
a
ball
where
all
the
splendor
and
fashion
of
the
place
would
assemble
and
where
it
was
expected
some
personages
of
exalted
rank
would
make
their
appearance
aura
melville
was
the
most
stoical
heart
did
palpitate
a
little
quicker
than
usual
when
edward
ainslie
requested
to
be
her
partner
the
two
first
dances
perhaps
those
quickened
pulsations
will
in
some
measure
account
for
the
perfect
indifference
with
which
she
had
listened
to
all
her
admirers
balls
in
anticipation
and
indeed
in
reality
are
very
pleasant
to
those
engaged
in
them
but
most
insufferably
dull
in
detail
it
will
therefore
be
sufficient
to
say
that
our
three
orphans
enjoyed
themselves
extremely
well
the
attentions
of
franklin
to
lucy
were
very
pointed
so
much
so
that
mr
matthews
was
resolved
should
they
continue
and
the
lieutenant
follow
them
into
hampshire
to
call
upon
him
for
an
explanation
of
his
intentions
and
candidly
state
to
him
miss
blakeney
s
real
situation
in
order
that
should
an
union
take
place
such
settlements
might
be
made
as
should
secure
to
her
independence
for
life
whatever
events
might
hereafter
happen
the
morning
after
the
ball
lady
mary
held
forth
for
a
full
hour
upon
the
splendid
appearance
gallant
manners
and
evident
flirted
and
flattered
till
he
had
stirred
up
a
strange
commotion
in
her
little
vain
heart
lucy
heard
her
and
smiled
aura
smiled
too
but
it
was
with
a
look
of
arch
meaning
while
she
replied
to
the
often
repeated
question
of
do
you
not
own
he
is
very
handsome
why
yes
as
far
as
tolerable
features
good
eyes
and
teeth
with
more
than
tolerable
dress
goes
i
think
he
is
passable
but
my
dear
lady
mary
he
has
no
noble
blood
in
his
veins
his
grandfather
was
only
lord
mayor
of
london
and
you
know
you
told
me
your
mother
would
not
rest
in
her
grave
if
you
matched
with
aught
below
nobility
now
sir
stephen
haynes
s
father
and
his
father
before
him
were
only
stationers
and
booksellers
and
who
knows
my
pretty
mary
lady
mary
i
beg
your
pardon
who
knows
but
this
very
sir
stephen
haynes
may
on
the
female
side
be
a
collateral
descendant
of
the
renowned
helena
with
his
cat
how
do
you
know
it
was
to
st
helena
aura
said
mr
matthews
looking
up
for
he
had
been
reading
in
the
parlour
where
the
young
folks
were
talking
over
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
oh
i
only
surmised
sir
because
i
read
in
some
geographical
work
that
the
island
of
st
helena
was
infested
with
rats
so
that
the
inhabitants
could
neither
raise
or
preserve
grain
of
any
kind
upon
it
in
which
case
a
cat
must
have
been
a
very
valuable
animal
lady
mary
would
have
left
the
parlour
in
a
pet
but
that
she
hoped
the
baronet
would
call
in
the
course
of
the
morning
he
did
so
and
exercised
the
art
of
flattery
so
successfully
that
mary
lumley
totally
forgot
the
years
younger
than
her
husband
and
still
that
constancy
that
devotedness
of
affection
that
charity
with
which
she
seems
to
be
always
waiting
to
promote
her
husband
s
comfort
the
improvement
of
her
children
and
the
happiness
of
all
around
her
in
the
centre
of
the
room
stands
an
old
fashioned
round
table
covered
with
books
newspapers
a
board
exhibiting
the
royal
game
of
fox
and
geese
and
all
the
feminine
apparatus
of
needle
work
on
the
side
of
the
table
if
side
can
be
predicated
of
a
round
form
next
his
mother
is
the
place
of
master
robert
gage
the
eldest
hope
a
scholar
fitting
for
college
already
ambitious
of
being
a
great
man
near
to
him
usually
stand
or
sit
his
two
brothers
frolicksome
fellows
whose
glee
over
their
game
or
their
books
frequently
awakens
their
mother
s
reproofs
the
rogues
however
pay
little
attention
to
her
soft
spoken
remonstrances
but
if
they
meet
their
father
s
eye
frowning
disprovingly
or
hear
they
are
hushed
as
sleep
opposite
master
robert
sits
the
only
daughter
of
my
host
the
sweet
catharine
positively
edward
the
loveliest
girl
i
ever
beheld
there
she
sits
looking
so
meek
and
innocent
as
she
bends
her
head
closer
to
her
work
whenever
i
too
earnestly
regard
her
but
sometimes
usually
when
i
enter
the
room
she
looks
up
in
my
face
with
such
a
smile
o
when
i
can
flatter
myself
as
i
try
to
do
that
it
welcomes
me
to
the
family
circle
you
can
not
know
how
happy
i
feel
i
am
prevented
from
taking
a
seat
beside
her
because
that
is
always
occupied
by
her
brother
john
the
youngest
child
but
one
he
loves
catharine
so
well
that
i
can
not
help
loving
the
little
urchin
on
her
account
or
otherwise
i
fear
i
should
really
hate
him
for
there
he
will
sit
a
full
hour
after
i
am
at
home
and
he
will
engross
all
the
attention
catharine
can
helps
her
wind
her
thread
and
he
holds
her
work
basket
and
picks
up
her
scissors
or
handkerchief
and
often
claims
a
kiss
for
his
reward
i
have
really
wanted
to
strike
that
boy
there
are
always
two
vacant
chairs
left
for
mr
silsby
and
your
humble
servant
and
as
i
have
my
first
choice
i
take
the
one
nearest
to
catharine
but
that
is
of
little
consequence
while
john
remains
colonel
gage
converses
with
the
ease
of
one
accustomed
to
society
and
he
has
moreover
all
the
fund
of
anecdote
which
a
revolutionary
soldier
and
a
pioneer
in
our
new
settlements
might
be
expected
to
possess
i
have
learned
more
from
him
of
the
early
history
of
my
country
more
of
the
peculiar
spirit
of
the
early
settlers
of
their
character
their
labors
and
resources
than
i
ever
learned
before
in
my
whole
life
at
nine
o
clock
or
a
little
before
mr
silsby
makes
his
appearance
and
then
the
four
younger
boys
are
dismissed
to
bed
manner
in
which
their
father
takes
leave
of
them
for
the
night
has
a
solemnity
that
awes
and
prevents
me
from
taking
any
advantage
of
my
proximity
to
address
catharine
the
boys
in
leaving
the
room
pass
directly
by
their
father
they
pause
before
him
while
he
in
a
tone
of
tender
and
touching
pathos
dispenses
a
few
sentences
of
reproof
advice
or
commendation
to
each
individual
i
never
witnessed
such
a
scene
i
should
think
it
would
have
a
powerful
effect
on
their
tender
hearts
for
when
as
he
receives
their
bow
or
kiss
he
adds
god
bless
you
my
children
i
often
find
it
difficult
to
breathe
freely
after
a
short
pause
however
we
begin
to
converse
and
all
join
in
the
discourse
more
cheerfully
if
possible
than
before
news
politics
literature
and
anecdote
with
an
occasional
tune
on
the
piano
forte
the
colonel
is
quite
an
enthusiast
in
his
love
of
music
and
the
hour
of
ten
that
we
always
have
apples
and
cider
and
frequently
nuts
of
some
kind
during
the
evening
and
furthermore
i
confess
that
during
the
last
hour
as
the
fire
is
gradually
suffered
to
decay
we
as
gradually
draw
nearer
to
the
hearth
and
our
circle
contracting
i
am
at
last
usually
quite
near
catharine
i
say
usually
because
whenever
catharine
leaves
her
chair
to
play
a
tune
she
seldom
returns
to
it
she
contrives
to
steal
round
to
her
father
s
side
and
seats
herself
on
a
low
chair
close
by
his
knee
a
seat
claimed
by
the
little
boy
when
he
is
there
i
wish
from
my
soul
he
would
take
that
small
chair
with
him
when
he
goes
to
bed
i
expect
you
will
smile
at
what
i
am
now
going
to
confess
you
will
wish
you
were
here
to
quiz
me
so
do
not
i
though
conscious
i
am
acting
rightly
i
have
hardly
sufficient
courage
yet
to
stand
the
test
of
ridicule
but
as
one
conquest
over
family
devotions
from
choice
that
i
kneel
at
prayers
that
colonel
gage
is
a
methodist
and
that
catharine
says
amen
in
a
tone
so
soft
sweet
and
angelic
that
it
causes
me
to
feel
my
own
unworthiness
more
poignantly
than
would
the
severest
reproofs
i
never
before
comprehended
what
the
distress
of
macbeth
was
when
he
could
not
say
amen
yes
edward
when
i
can
kneel
beside
that
innocent
girl
and
catch
her
soft
whispered
amen
as
her
saint
like
father
pauses
in
the
aspirations
he
has
been
pouring
forth
perhaps
for
my
salvation
i
fancy
she
always
responds
the
sweetest
then
though
in
the
lowest
tone
my
heart
throbs
and
swells
till
i
believe
tears
have
relieved
me
from
the
agitation
of
my
feelings
but
this
agitation
is
not
care
or
pain
or
discontent
no
i
lay
my
head
on
my
pillow
in
peace
everything
around
me
is
peaceful
my
reflections
are
all
tinged
with
the
o
evenings
worthy
of
the
gods
you
may
exclaim
while
revelling
in
your
round
of
amusements
he
said
and
died
butler
on
perceiving
from
his
station
on
the
balcony
this
interruption
to
the
execution
of
his
victims
hastened
forward
to
ascertain
distinctly
the
cause
by
the
time
he
approached
the
hermit
had
ceased
to
speak
he
saw
brandt
powerfully
affected
he
was
surprised
for
he
knew
not
the
cause
what
is
this
the
hero
of
the
mohawks
said
he
upbraiding
his
confederate
in
iniquity
i
thought
thou
hadst
the
soul
of
a
warrior
but
thy
heart
is
grown
feeble
like
a
woman
s
the
spirits
of
thy
fathers
will
be
ashamed
of
thy
weakness
brandt
cast
upon
him
a
look
of
indignation
the
spirits
of
my
fathers
ashamed
of
me
he
exclaimed
ay
they
will
curse
me
but
thou
thou
hast
nothing
to
do
with
my
fathers
hie
hence
lest
if
thou
frettest
what
art
thou
indeed
mad
cried
butler
in
astonishment
does
it
grieve
thee
that
thou
hast
slain
a
peevish
grey
beard
who
was
thy
enemy
ha
cried
brandt
seizing
his
tomahawk
which
was
still
reeking
with
the
blood
of
his
father
if
thou
wilt
scoff
again
i
have
a
weapon
accustomed
to
pierce
hearts
by
the
blood
that
is
now
upon
it
i
swear
i
am
thy
friend
no
longer
nonsense
returned
butler
perceiving
the
impolicy
of
irritating
the
savage
farther
i
wish
not
to
offend
thee
i
can
not
comprehend
the
cause
of
thy
agitation
but
enough
of
it
let
us
now
proceed
with
the
sacrifice
of
the
prisoners
ah
exclaimed
the
savage
his
habitual
taste
for
destruction
returning
our
customs
require
it
he
was
but
a
white
man
he
said
to
the
executioners
who
now
stood
near
him
and
could
not
be
and
let
the
sacrifice
be
offered
being
no
longer
in
awe
of
rodolph
whom
they
now
considered
a
deceiver
and
who
lay
dead
before
them
the
executioners
hastened
to
re
kindle
their
brands
which
they
soon
accomplished
and
waving
them
as
they
blazed
and
crackled
in
the
air
they
proceeded
towards
the
piles
but
before
they
could
apply
the
flaming
instruments
to
their
destructive
purpose
a
sudden
shout
of
warlike
voices
issued
from
the
woods
and
a
number
of
musket
balls
pierced
each
of
them
together
with
the
ferocious
brandt
and
stretched
them
on
the
ground
this
was
instantaneously
followed
by
a
more
abundant
visitation
of
the
same
deadly
missiles
upon
the
thickest
groups
of
the
indians
more
than
a
hundred
of
whom
fell
and
the
rest
fled
in
terror
from
the
scene
butler
with
the
whole
force
of
the
tories
was
now
advancing
to
check
the
flight
of
the
indians
and
give
battle
to
the
assailants
when
henry
austin
at
the
head
of
the
wyoming
volunteers
the
wood
and
charged
the
traitorous
destroyers
with
the
bayonet
they
made
but
a
short
resistance
they
were
unable
to
withstand
even
the
first
shock
of
their
disciplined
adversaries
they
broke
and
imitating
their
indian
allies
fled
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
leaving
two
hundred
of
their
party
dead
on
the
field
butler
even
in
this
extremity
resolved
to
make
an
effort
to
retain
possession
of
agnes
he
hurried
from
the
scene
of
battle
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
the
day
was
lost
to
the
balcony
where
he
had
left
her
in
charge
of
a
sentinel
by
this
time
however
the
prisoners
were
unbound
and
dr
watson
whose
anxious
eye
followed
the
career
of
butler
over
the
field
perceived
this
movement
the
intention
of
which
he
at
once
conjectured
just
as
henry
austin
approached
towards
him
fly
henry
said
he
fly
to
yonder
balcony
and
save
your
betrothed
from
the
destroyer
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
henry
obeyed
her
off
he
with
one
spring
mounted
the
balcony
and
one
powerful
thrust
of
his
sword
annihilated
the
opposition
which
the
sentinel
imprudently
offered
to
his
advance
upon
butler
ah
infamous
miscreant
cried
he
to
the
latter
thank
heaven
i
have
thee
i
know
that
this
is
my
death
scene
said
the
courageous
ruffian
for
thy
soldiers
surround
me
but
i
shall
die
with
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
thou
my
detested
rival
shalt
not
survive
to
enjoy
agnes
so
saying
he
made
a
desperate
pass
at
henry
aiming
not
to
save
himself
but
to
destroy
his
antagonist
that
antagonist
however
was
too
expert
a
swords
man
to
be
endangered
by
such
maniac
rashness
he
struck
the
coming
weapon
aside
with
such
force
that
it
almost
flew
from
its
owner
s
grasp
while
his
own
sword
in
its
backward
sweep
nearly
dissevered
butler
s
head
from
his
body
by
that
heaven
directed
blow
said
colonel
dennison
hast
avenged
the
desolation
of
a
whole
people
thou
hast
also
said
dr
watson
who
entered
immediately
after
the
colonel
avenged
thy

and
rescued
thy

from
unspeakable
misery
from
the
hands
of
a
villain

exclaimed
henry
straining

to
his
palpitating
breast

said
she
oh

thanks
to

indeed
happiness
the
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
she
hid
her
burning
blushes
in
his
bosom
and
sobbed
aloud
the
grateful
agitations
of
her
heart

my

said
mr

who
now
with
miss

advanced

this

thee
and
to
her
vows
amidst
the
severest
trials
that
could
beset
human
nature
but
we
haste
to
close
our
narrative
and
must
therefore
decline
entering
into
a
detail
of
the
congratulations
and
outpourings
of
gratitude
of
which
henry
austin
was
now
the
object
the
party
retired
from
the
eventful
balcony
to
the
residence
of
mr
norwood
which
was
so
lately
the
prison
of
its
venerable
master
and
his
friends
henry
now
informed
them
that
it
was
owing

my
wedding
ring

to
my
wife
and
what
shall
i
say
to
her

to
say
no
message
to
send
to
her
not

word

mary
the
ring

be

to
satisfy
her

do
for
you
where

i
find

with
a
bitter
smile

but

pray

to
leave
me
now
and
go
straightway
to

with
that
ring

dear
sir

deeply
affected
by
his
manner

and
you

done
for

all
that
it
is
now
possible
for
man
to
do
edwards
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
say
there
is
no
hope
for
me
no
hope
finish
what
i
had
to
say
turning
toward
the
messenger
who
had
several
banknotes
in
his
hand
which
he
had
picked
up
without
being
observed
and
which
had
been
carried
away
by
the
draft
from
the
open
door
while
we
were
engaged
in
the
fearful
inquiry
that
his
appearance
had
provoked
now
sir
i
am
ready
for
you
good
night
all
good
night
good
night
good
night
said
every
body
in
the
room
and
almost
every
body
with
a
voice
of
deep
seated
emotion
they
were
scattered
about
some
sitting
some
standing
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
through
the
roof
he
passed
out
and
i
was
going
to
follow
when
i
was
stopped
by
two
strangers
while
the
man
that
i
saw
at
the
cottage
fontleroy
stepped
forward
with
a
cheerful
air
and
begged
to
know
if
bail
would
be
received
bail
no
said
a
gruff
voice
and
we
parted
he
for
a
lock
up
house
i
thought
and
i
to
deliver
a
to
see
chapter
xxii
the
ring
the
watchman
the
moment
i
was
in
the
street
i
began
to
look
about
for
a
coach
determined
whatever
might
be
the
hour
to
lose
no
time
in
the
delivery
of
the
charge
entrusted
to
me
for
how
could
i
be
sure
of
the
morrow
how
could
i
know
what
story
the
ring
would
tell
to
the
deserted
wife
what
was
to
be
done
should
or
should
i
not
see
her
should
i
go
to
her
at
once
or
wait
till
the
morrow
there
would
be
no
sleep
for
her
while
the
husband
of
her
heart
was
away
no
sleep
for
me
till
i
had
done
what
i
had
undertaken
to
do
but
there
was
no
coach
to
be
had
the
great
squares
and
wide
streets
before
me
were
all
deserted
i
drew
out
my
watch
with
surprise
i
had
no
idea
of
the
hour
it
was
after
three
o
clock
the
lamps
were
going
out
and
i
saw
on
looking
up
the
day
light
spreading
over
a
clear
blue
sky
and
felt
as
i
stood
there
debating
with
myself
how
to
proceed
what
i
have
not
felt
since
the
cool
air
blowing
upon
my
forehead
as
if
i
were
at
sea
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
after
a
little
hesitation
i
hurried
away
agitated
with
a
fear
that
grew
more
and
more
insupportable
at
every
step
and
giddy
with
a
feeling
that
i
dare
not
speak
of
now
before
i
had
determined
what
course
to
pursue
i
found
myself
at
the
door
of
no
street
bedford
square
i
stopped
i
stood
still
my
courage
died
away
and
i
strove
to
reason
myself
out
of
the
dreadful
vague
fear
that
possessed
me
but
i
could
not
and
i
was
actually
turning
away
from
the
door
with
a
determination
which
a
few
minutes
before
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
make
when
i
saw
a
light
which
appeared
to
proceed
from
the
back
parlor
on
the
ground
floor
it
be
sure
to
see
from
the
place
where
a
fond
faithful
wife
is
watching
over
a
baby
or
waiting
for
its
father
i
knocked
and
immediately
the
light
moved
and
a
voice
reached
my
ear
with
an
accent
of
joy
and
a
step
came
hurrying
to
the
door
but
just
when
it
was
so
near
that
i
felt
it
necessary
to
draw
back
i
heard
another
step
and
a
heavier
one
approach
and
after
a
word
or
two
in
a
sweet
kind
voice
that
nobody
could
hear
without
emotion
the
light
eager
step
withdrew
and
the
door
was
opened
a
little
way
a
very
little
way
just
far
enough
for
me
to
see
the
head
of
a
man
stooping
with
age
who
started
back
when
he
saw
me
saying
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
here
i
should
like
to
know
where
is
master
ned
who
is
it
philip
cried
some
one
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
where
i
saw
the
shadow
of
a
woman
projected
to
her
bosom
and
her
whole
attitude
that
of
one
who
listens
with
breathless
anxiety
i
do
nt
know
i
m
sure
it
s
a
stranger
said
he
grappling
the
heavy
door
chain
with
both
hands
looking
at
me
as
if
he
had
just
been
waked
out
of
a
sound
sleep
and
speaking
as
if
he
thought
i
intended
to
force
my
way
a
stranger
is
he
alone
i
believe
so
peeping
out
as
he
spoke
go
to
your
mistress
and
say
to
her
if
she
has
not
retired
that
i
beg
leave
to
see
her
said
i
i
have
a
message
for
her
open
the
door
philip
open
the
door
i
know
that
voice
but
the
old
man
could
not
open
the
door
the
chain
was
heavy
the
catch
had
slipped
and
he
shook
so
that
i
could
not
help
asking
where
the
other
servants
were
he
made
no
reply
but
i
saw
by
his
look
that
notwithstanding
all
i
had
been
of
powdered
lackeys
and
rich
livery
there
were
no
other
servants
in
that
large
house
now
that
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
company
away
none
but
this
more
courteous
reply
there
was
now
another
pause
and
mrs
leet
seemed
revolving
in
her
mind
how
it
might
best
be
broken
we
shall
be
sorry
to
see
you
go
forth
from
the
shelter
of
our
roof
to
night
mr
pardon
me
sir
i
have
forgotten
your
name
kellond
at
your
service
madam
thomas
kellond
and
my
friend
mr
kirk
ah
thank
you
let
me
help
you
to
a
bit
of
this
cold
chicken
mr
kellond
you
must
have
found
but
poor
accommodations
on
your
route
you
dined
at
middletown
i
presume
sir
continued
mrs
leet
we
ate
our
last
meal
at
hartford
madam
replied
mr
kellond
and
certainly
had
nothing
to
complain
of
for
we
colony
could
afford
governor
leet
who
had
till
this
moment
affected
perfect
indifference
to
the
communications
of
the
strangers
now
lifted
his
large
blue
eyes
fixing
them
alternately
upon
each
of
his
unknown
guests
with
a
gaze
of
deep
and
fluctuating
curiosity
a
conversation
which
he
had
previously
maintained
with
mr
russel
was
however
quickly
resumed
though
from
time
to
time
an
anxious
glance
at
the
strangers
intimated
a
greater
degree
of
interest
in
their
communications
than
he
chose
to
express
the
repast
was
at
length
completed
and
the
table
having
been
removed
to
a
less
conspicuous
station
the
family
again
encircled
the
fire
meanwhile
every
thing
had
been
arranged
according
to
the
well
established
rules
of
the
household
a
fresh
supply
of
fuel
crackled
on
the
neatly
swept
hearth
the
stand
the
lights
and
the
books
were
all
in
waiting
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
place
the
children
surrounded
a
low
round
table
pursuing
their
respective
avocations
with
an
air
of
decorum
which
contrasted
strongly
with
a
demure
countenance
knitting
a
pair
of
woolen
hose
for
her
brother
while
the
latter
leaned
with
frowning
brows
upon
his
slate
beside
her
flourishing
his
pencil
with
many
a
threatening
manoeuvre
over
the
mysterious
problems
beneath
the
youth
did
indeed
occasionally
pause
amid
his
mathematical
reveries
to
examine
into
the
conduct
of
an
intelligent
kitten
sporting
beneath
the
table
at
that
moment
dextrously
engaged
with
susan
s
ball
and
amusing
her
fancy
with
the
graceful
undulations
of
the
long
white
thread
as
it
darted
across
her
way
but
no
such
trivial
sport
had
power
to
arrest
the
attention
of
henry
davenport
as
he
bowed
his
young
head
over
the
classic
page
his
hand
supported
his
forehead
straying
among
the
dark
and
beautiful
locks
that
shaded
it
and
whenever
the
eye
of
the
youthful
scholar
was
for
a
moment
lifted
there
was
that
in
its
deep
lustre
that
told
of
a
mind
fitted
to
revel
among
the
rich
fountains
of
ancient
lore
gifted
with
the
inspiration
of
exalted
fancy
and
the
history
is
woven
with
our
tale
sat
in
a
low
chair
beside
him
in
the
first
bloom
of
infant
thoughts
and
feelings
and
with
the
tints
of
cradle
dreams
still
bright
in
her
young
fancy
her
eyes
seemed
intent
on
the
personages
who
now
surrounded
the
fire
their
naturally
pensive
expression
often
vanishing
amid
smiles
and
dimples
as
she
met
their
glances
in
return
indeed
there
were
others
who
now
began
to
survey
the
scene
with
much
interest
governor
leet
after
exchanging
his
boots
for
slippers
had
seated
himself
by
the
opposite
stand
the
candles
were
snuffed
the
spectacles
wiped
and
replaced
and
he
now
seemed
waiting
with
the
most
comfortable
composure
for
any
commmunications
that
might
be
made
the
silence
of
curious
expectation
pervaded
the
whole
apartment
interrupted
only
by
the
slight
and
occasional
ringing
of
the
china
cups
as
mrs
leet
carefully
wiped
and
replaced
them
on
the
waiter
considerable
hesitation
seemed
to
exist
with
the
strangers
as
to
which
of
them
should
first
open
their
embassy
but
at
of
studied
reserve
broke
silence
governor
leet
the
business
with
which
we
are
intrusted
is
of
an
official
and
private
nature
it
would
be
well
that
we
had
fewer
witnesses
no
one
here
but
my
family
i
believe
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
his
eye
passing
in
rapid
review
over
the
circle
unless
indeed
we
except
this
young
friend
of
ours
and
his
eye
rested
on
mr
russel
but
we
reckon
him
about
as
good
as
one
of
us
he
added
with
an
expression
of
pleasantry
which
brought
the
blood
in
richer
tides
to
miss
weldon
s
cheek
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
believe
we
are
all
to
be
trusted
nevertheless
you
must
be
aware
sir
replied
mr
kirk
as
he
drew
forth
a
large
pocket
book
that
there
are
certain
undertakings
which
need
to
be
executed
with
secrecy
and
despatch
in
order
to
insure
them
success
perfectly
the
young
gentleman
after
carefully
examining
the
contents
of
the
pocket
book
presented
him
with
a
folded
paper
the
governor
glanced
anxiously
over
it
and
those
who
were
watching
his
countenance
perceived
that
it
became
instantly
and
strongly
flushed
his
natural
composure
of
aspect
was
however
soon
resumed
and
he
began
in
a
low
whisper
to
examine
its
contents
miss
weldon
was
seated
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
stand
on
which
her
uncle
leaned
and
she
became
instantly
aware
that
the
kind
of
humming
tone
into
which
the
whisper
had
gradually
swelled
was
not
the
unconscious
and
unnecessary
sound
it
seemed
with
the
quickness
of
female
penetration
she
at
once
perceived
that
there
was
something
in
the
contents
of
the
paper
which
her
uncle
desired
her
to
understand
the
frill
she
was
working
dropped
from
her
hand
and
leaning
her
head
over
the
table
she
listened
with
breathless
interest
to
the
voice
of
the
reader
after
a
short
suspension
the
low
murinur
again
commenced
but
as
yet
she
caught
nothing
but
more
distinct
and
the
words
treason
and
rebellion
were
plainly
distinguished
then
was
another
pause
and
then
distinctly
followed
and
we
do
hereby
authorize
and
appoint
our
true
and
loyal
subjects
governor
leet
exclaimed
mr
kirk
hastily
you
must
be
aware
that
the
revealing
of
state
secrets
may
be
attended
with
serious
the
world
and
a
soldier
to
be
overcome
by
a
non
entity
an
ideal
mockery
he
resolved
not
to
harbour
even
the
consciousness
of
having
suspect
that
if
the
voice
had
not
been
altogether
imaginary
it
might
have
proceeded
from
some
person
desirous
of
playing
him
a
trick
and
who
had
consequently
become
acquainted
with
the
timidity
he
had
displayed
and
would
no
doubt
expose
it
so
as
to
render
him
an
object
of
ridicule
among
his
companions
such
a
thought
he
could
not
endure
he
therefore
again
turned
his
steps
towards
the
arbour
and
again
from
some
inexplicable
cause
he
became
alarmed
as
he
approached
it
he
stole
slowly
and
cautiously
forward
as
if
he
were
afraid
to
apprize
the
attendant
spirit
of
the
fatal
spot
of
his
presence
he
strained
to
the
utmost
his
faculties
of
seeing
and
hearing
in
order
that
nothing
whether
earthly
or
unearthly
should
take
him
by
surprise
the
wind
was
gentle
but
to
his
excited
senses
it
moved
audibly
with
fitful
sighs
among
the
trembling
leaves
of
the
pendent
willows
that
surrounded
him
as
he
drew
near
to
the
arbour
louder
than
was
consistent
with
the
mild
condition
of
the
wind
at
length
the
articulate
sounds
of
ruin
ruin
struck
upon
his
ear
a
sudden
chillness
crept
over
him
he
faltered
in
his
pace
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
he
struggled
with
his
weakness
his
courage
returned
and
he
determined
not
to
yield
again
to
the
influence
of
terror
be
its
cause
either
real
or
imaginary
with
a
violent
effort
he
advanced
to
the
entrance
of
the
arbour
but
he
advanced
no
further
for
there
now
stood
before
his
terrified
vision
a
figure
which
sent
a
cold
shuddering
through
all
his
veins
and
almost
froze
the
current
of
his
life
at
its
fountain
it
was
the
figure
of
mary
balantyne
in
her
winding
sheet
shadowy
thin
pale
pensive
and
awfully
solemn
in
her
looks
she
shook
her
head
slowly
and
mournfully
as
she
fixed
a
withering
gaze
upon
him
he
would
in
the
surprise
of
his
first
recognition
of
her
appearance
have
sunk
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
at
which
he
caught
while
his
enfeebled
joints
trembled
beneath
him
harris
however
was
neither
cowardly
nor
superstitious
and
he
had
long
indulged
in
absolute
scepticism
regarding
the
spirits
of
deceased
human
beings
becoming
visible
on
earth
in
a
few
seconds
therefore
he
began
to
rally
his
fortitude
and
soon
recovered
sufficient
firmness
to
look
at
the
apparition
and
address
it
who
art
thou
said
he
that
assumest
the
likeness
of
one
who
is
dead
and
can
not
consequently
be
now
standing
before
me
wretched
man
the
figure
replied
and
its
voice
thrilled
fearfully
like
electric
fire
along
the
nerves
of
the
awe
struck
criminal
remember
this
fatal
spot
dark
is
thy
doom
we
meet
again
the
apparition
then
slowly
faded
away
among
the
foliage

mist

from

cloud

the
terrified
culprit
was
for
some
time
scarcely
sensible
of
the
departure
of
the
awful
image
his
fixed
gaze
was
riveted
as
if
by
enchantment
on
the
spot
where
it
had
stood
and
its
fearful
words
still
tingled
in
his
ears
his
perceptions
at
length
gradually
returned
to
their
natural
state
and
he
became
sensible
of
his
true
situation
his
strength
of
frame
was
restored
and
perhaps
his
hardihood
but
not
his
tranquillity
of
mind
he
hastened
to
his
quarters
but
his
conscience
was
now
disturbed
and
he
no
longer
reflected
with
pride
or
complacency
on
the
triumph
he
had
gained
in
the
shades
of
dilworth
over
the
innocence
and
virtue
of
the
loveliest
maiden
they
had
ever
screened
from
the
glare
of
the
noon
tide
sun
but
although
frightened
into
remorse
he
was
not
humbled
into
penitence
instead
of
seeking
tranquillity
in
a
fixed
resolution
to
sin
no
more
he
sought
oblivion
for
his
troubles
in
the
intoxicating
revel
and
in
the
jovial
carousals
of
his
brother
officers
awful
apparition
in

soon
for

of

to

the
most
mischievous

its

by

who
would
be
driven
by
the
goadings
of
remorse
to
seek

relief
in
amendment
of
life
fly
to
the
fallacious
substitute
which
is
offered
in
the
hilarity
of
the
bowl
and
instead
of
cherishing
that
salutary
regret
for
past
misconduct
which
would
naturally
lead
to
reformation
as
the
only
means
of
regaining
tranquillity
they
seek
a
transient
refuge
from
remorse
in
the
turbulence
of
a
fleeting
madness
which
removes
every
good
impression
and
confirms
every
evil
propensity

him
of
his
crime
and
of
the
awful
vision
which
had
denounced
him
for
it
he
hastened
to
remove
from

he

with

activity
into

man
feels
at
the
sight
of
the
dying
took
possession
of
him
and
he
became
calm
again
the
approach
of
death
has
so
much
which
is
exalting
that
our
grief
for
the
time
is
forgotten
and
could
one
who
had
seen
arthur
a
few
hours
before
now
have
countenance
he
would
hardly
have
known
him
the
livid
hue
of
death
was
fast
spreading
over
his
mother
s
face
he
stooped
forward
to
catch
the
sound
of
her
breathing
it
grew
quick
and
faint
my
mother
she
opened
her
eyes
for
the
last
time
upon
him
and
a
faint
flush
passed
over
her
cheek
there
was
the
serenity
of
an
angel
in
her
look
her
hand
just
pressed
his
it
was
all
over
his
spirit
had
endured
to
its
utmost
it
sunk
down
from
its
unearthly
height
and
with
his
face
upon
his
mother
s
pillow
he
wept
like
a
child
he
arose
with
a
softened
grief
and
stepping
into
an
adjoining
chamber
spoke
to
his
aunt
it
is
past
said
he
is
my
sister
asleep
well
be
it
so
let
her
have
rest
she
needs
it
he
then
went
to
his
own
chamber
and
shut
himself
in
it
is
a
merciful
itself
a
relief
violent
grief
brings
on
a
torpor
and
indistinctness
as
from
long
watching
it
is
not
till
the
violence
of
affliction
has
subsided
and
gentle
and
soothing
thoughts
can
find
room
to
mix
with
our
sorrow
and
holy
consolations
can
minister
to
us
that
we
are
able
to
know
fully
our
loss
and
see
clearly
what
has
been
torn
away
from
our
affections
it
was
so
with
arthur
unconnected
thoughts
with
melancholy
but
half
formed
images
were
floating
in
his
mind
and
now
and
then
a
gleam
of
light
would
pass
through
it
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
troubled
trance
and
all
was
right
again
his
worn
and
tired
feelings
at
last
found
rest
in
sleep
it
is
an
impression
which
we
can
not
rid
ourselves
of
if
we
would
when
sitting
by
the
body
of
a
friend
that
he
has
still
a
consciousness
of
our
presence
that
though
the
common
concerns
of
the
world
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
he
has
still
a
love
and
long
been
familiar
with
when
it
was
all
life
and
motion
seems
only
in
a
state
of
rest
we
know
not
how
to
make
it
real
to
ourselves
that
in
the
body
before
us
there
is
not
a
something
still
alive
arthur
was
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
he
sat
alone
in
the
room
by
his
mother
the
day
after
her
death
it
was
as
if
her
soul
was
holding
communion
with
pure
spirits
in
paradise
though
it
still
abode
in
the
body
that
lay
before
him
he
felt
as
if
sanctified
by
the
presence
of
one
to
whom
the
other
world
had
been
laid
open
as
if
under
the
love
and
protection
of
one
made
holy
the
religious
reflections
that
his
mother
had
early
taught
him
gave
him
strength
a
spiritual
composure
stole
over
him
and
he
found
himself
prepared
to
perform
the
last
offices
to
the
dead
is
it
not
enough
to
see
our
friends
die
and
part
with
them
for
the
rest
of
our
days
to
reflect
that
they
will
never
look
on
us
again
to
see
that
turning
to
corruption
which
was
but
just
now
alive
and
eloquent
and
beautiful
with
the
sensations
of
the
soul
are
our
sorrows
so
sacred
and
peculiar
as
to
make
the
world
as
vanity
to
us
and
the
men
of
it
as
strangers
and
shall
we
not
be
left
to
our
afflictions
for
a
few
hours
must
we
be
brought
out
at
such
a
time
to
the
concerned
or
careless
gaze
of
those
we
know
not
or
be
made
to
bear
the
formal
proffers
of
consolation
from
acquaintances
who
will
go
away
and
forget
it
all
shall
we
not
be
suffered
for
a
little
while
a
holy
and
healing
communion
with
the
dead
must
the
kindred
stillness
and
gloom
of
our
dwelling
be
changed
for
the
show
of
the
pall
the
talk
of
the
passers
by
and
the
broad
and
piercing
light
of
the
common
sun
must
the
ceremonies
of
the
world
wait
on
us
even
to
the
open
graves
of
our
friends
when
the
hour
eye
though
his
face
was
tremulous
with
the
struggle
within
him
he
went
to
his
sister
and
took
her
arm
within
his
the
bell
struck
its
heavy
undulating
sound
rolled
forward
like
a
sea
he
felt
a
violent
beating
through
his
frame
which
shook
him
so
that
he
reeled
it
was
but
a
momentary
weakness
he
moved
on
passing
those
who
surrounded
him
as
if
they
had
been
shadows
while
he
followed
the
slow
hearse
there
was
a
vacancy
in
his
eye
as
it
rested
on
the
coffin
which
showed
him
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
before
him
his
spirit
was
with
his
mother
s
as
he
reached
the
grave
he
shrunk
back
and
turned
deadly
pale
but
dropping
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
drawing
his
hat
over
his
face
he
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
till
the
service
was
action

degree
excuse
its
introduction

barbarities
committed

it
when
there
but
never
let
the
midsummer
night
s
dream
fret
work
of
an
ethereal
imagination
have
a
tangible
existence
let
us
pass
to
the
common
acting
plays
macbeth
you
are
sitting
by
the
fire
on
a
winter
s
evening
wrapped
in
the
perusal
of
this
masterpiece
of
nature
s
masterpiece
preparatory
to
visiting
the
theatre
to
see
it
played
in
your
mind
s
eye
you
perceive
the
blasted
heath
the
scene
of
macbeth
s
temptation
sterile
and
wild
covered
with
masses
of
primeval
and
herbless
granite
and
untenanted
save
by
the
lonely
plover
or
shy
and
solitary
moorcock
beside
some
rude
cairn
are
clustered
the
weird
sisters
posters
of
the
sea
and
land
recounting
their
exploits
and
holding
devilish
consultation
in
the
distance
is
the
army
of
macbeth
there
is
a
bleak
and
gloomy
grandeur
in
the
picture
you
have
drawn
and
you
hasten
to
the
theatre
to
have
it
realized
does
not
your
enthusiasm
receive
a
shock
before
you
is
some
old
confined
wood
scene
used
on
all
occasions
divers
illdrilled
supernumeraries
huddled
together
in
most
unseemly
proximity
while
the
hags
so
wither
d
and
so
wild
in
their
attire
are
generally
represented
for
what
reason
managers
only
know
by
three
low
comedians
for
the
most
part
hearty
plump
oleaginous
personages
with
whom
all
sorts
of
odd
out
of
the
way
associations
are
connected
in
patched
red
and
tartan
petticoats
and
stationed
in
the
full
glare
of
the
gas
lamps
true
some
of
this
can
not
be
remedied
but
much
of
it
might
were
a
tithe
part
of
the
money
and
attention
directed
towards
it
that
is
wasted
on
some
gaud
or
pantomime
and
much
that
is
now
vulgar
common
place
and
ridiculous
might
by
the
aid
of
a
little
liberality
and
common
sense
be
rendered
grand
and
impressive
but
the
managers
think
that
shakspeare
may
be
used
and
abused
after
any
fashion
that
he
has
stamina
for
any
thing
and
they
think
right
though
they
act
wrong
scenery
machinery
dresses
and
decorations
yet
but
alas
what
mental
millwright
what
skilful
machinist
will
put
in
order
and
wind
up
the
talking
machines
that
do
the
subordinate
parts
about
the
theatre
to
the
true
shaksperian
pitch
and
set
them
a
going
for
the
night
is
the
schoolmaster
yet
abroad
ordained
to
shed
a
ray
of
light
upon
their
benighted
understandings
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
author
or
make
them
sensible
of
the
simple
but
important
fact
that
blank
verse
is
not
prose
and
ought
to
be
spoken
differently
here
it
is
where
our
great
dramatic
poet
principally
suffers
the
exuberant
genius
of
shakspeare
could
not
stoop
to
petty
calculations
it
never
entered
into
his
thoughts
what
unimaginative
pieces
of
mortality
would
in
after
times
give
utterance
to
the
glorious
poetry
that
is
scattered
indiscriminately
over
his
pages
small
occasion
had
he
to
play
the
niggard
and
carefully
apportion
out
his
sweet
fancies
and
rare
conceits
to
those
who
would
be
likely
to
give
the
most
effect
in
the
representation
and
hence
it
is
that
the
plodding
gentlemen
with
small
salaries
and
corresponding
capacities
who
in
other
authors
have
language
admirably
adapted
to
their
modes
of
thinking
and
expression
put
into
their
mouths
have
frequently
when
doing
their
work
in
subordinate
characters
in
shakspeare
to
utter
passages
redolent
with
beauty
which
they
do
in
a
way
that
very
satisfactorily
shows
these
imperfect
speakers
have
little
occasion
to
thank
the
gods
for
having
made
them
poetical
of
all
shakspeare
s
characters
there
are
not
any
so
systematically
ill
used
as
these
same
witches
in
macbeth
it
has
been
thought
by
many
who
know
something
of
the
matter
that
there
are
a
wildness
and
sublimity
in
the
character
and
attributes
of
those
malignant
hags
that
are
perfectly
inapproachable
by
any
one
below
shakspeare
s
calibre
and
be
it
noted
they
are
not
only
of
wondrous
import
of
themselves
but
the
mainspring
of
all
the
principal
events
in
the
great
drama
to
which
they
belong
the
talent
and
intellect
of
the
greatest
ornaments
the
stage
has
produced
would
not
be
strange
and
fantastical
creations
yet
what
are
they
at
present
three
old
women
absolute
objects
of
mockery
and
laughter
to
the
audience
nay
this
seems
in
some
degree
to
be
now
their
legitimate
purpose
for
it
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
that
when
the
spectators
are
more
decorous
than
usual
some
of
the
witches
by
a
grotesque
action
or
ridiculous
intonation
appeal
to
them
for
the
customary
tribute
a
hearty
laugh
but
it
is
not
always
the
actors
who
are
in
fault
there
is
one
thing
which
has
always
especially
moved
my
admiration
it
is
the
marvellous
small
provocative
to
laughter
which
people
require
when
congregated
together
in
large
bodies
and
when
it
is
quite
clear
they
should
do
any
earthly
thing
rather
than
laugh
here
for
instance
where
the
most
solemn
attention
and
breathless
anxiety
should
pervade
the
house
first
mingling
their
delicate
green
with
the
deep
hues
of
the
early
summer
grain
the
whole
landscape
had
a
fresh
breezy
look
it
was
not
hedged
in
from
the
highways
but
seemed
to
welcome
him
with
open
arms
i
felt
less
a
stranger
in
the
land
and
as
my
eye
traced
the
dusty
road
winding
along
through
a
rich
cultivated
country
and
skirted
on
either
side
with
blossomed
fruit
trees
and
occasionally
caught
glimpses
of
a
little
farm
house
resting
in
a
green
hollow
and
lapped
in
the
bosom
of
plenty
i
felt
that
i
was
in
a
prosperous
hospitable
and
happy
land
i
had
taken
my
seat
on
top
of
the
diligence
in
order
to
have
a
better
view
of
the
country
it
was
one
of
those
ponderous
vehicles
which
totter
slowly
along
the
paved
roads
of
france
laboring
beneath
a
mountain
of
trunks
and
bales
of
all
descriptions
and
like
the
trojan
horse
bore
a
groaning
multitude
within
it
it
was
a
curious
and
cumbersome
machine
resembling
the
bodies
of
three
coaches
placed
upon
one
carriage
with
a
cabriolet
on
top
for
outside
passengers
on
the
pannels
of
each
door
were
painted
the
fleurs
de
lis
of
france
and
upon
the
side
gnrale
des
messageries
royales
des
diligences
pour
le
havre
rouen
et
paris
it
would
be
useless
to
describe
the
motley
groups
that
filled
the
four
quarters
of
this
little
world
there
was
the
dusty
tradesman
with
green
coat
and
cotton
umbrella
the
sallow
invalid
in
skull
cap
and
cloth
shoes
the
priest
in
his
cassock
the
peasant
in
his
frock
and
a
whole
family
of
squalling
children
my
fellow
travellers
on
top
were
a
gay
subaltern
with
fierce
mustaches
and
a
nut
brown
village
beauty
of
sweet
sixteen
the
subaltern
wore
a
military
undress
and
a
little
blue
cloth
cap
in
the
shape
of
a
cow
bell
trimmed
smartly
with
silver
lace
and
cocked
on
one
side
of
his
head
the
brunette
was
decked
out
with
a
staid
white
norman
cap
nicely
starched
and
plaited
and
nearly
three
feet
high
a
rosary
and
cross
about
her
neck
a
linsey
woolsey
gown
and
wooden
shoes
the
personage
who
seemed
to
rule
this
little
world
with
absolute
sway
was
a
and
the
sonorous
title
of
monsieur
le
conducteur
as
insignia
of
office
he
wore
a
little
round
fur
cap
and
fur
trimmed
jacket
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
small
leathern
port
folio
containing
his
way
bill
he
sat
with
us
on
top
of
the
diligence
and
with
comic
gravity
issued
his
mandates
to
the
postillion
below
like
some
petty
monarch
speaking
from
his
throne
in
every
dingy
village
we
thundered
through
he
had
a
thousand
commissions
to
execute
and
to
receive
a
package
to
throw
out
on
this
side
and
another
to
take
in
on
that
a
whisper
for
the
landlady
at
the
inn
a
love
letter
and
a
kiss
for
her
daughter
and
a
wink
or
a
snap
of
his
fingers
for
the
chamber
maid
at
the
window
then
there
were
so
many
questions
to
be
asked
and
answered
while
changing
horses
every
body
had
a
word
to
say
it
was
monsieur
le
conducteur
here
monsieur
le
conducteur
there
he
was
in
complete
bustle
till
at
length
we
lumbered
away
in
a
cloud
of
dust
but
what
most
attracted
my
attention
was
the
grotesque
appearance
of
the
postillion
and
the
horses
he
was
a
comical
looking
little
fellow
already
past
the
heyday
of
life
with
a
thin
sharp
countenance
to
which
the
smoke
of
tobacco
and
the
fumes
of
wine
had
given
the
dusty
look
of
wrinkled
parchment
he
was
equipped
in
a
short
jacket
of
purple
velvet
set
off
with
a
red
collar
and
adorned
with
silken
cord
tight
pantaloons
of
bright
yellow
leather
arrayed
his
pipe
stem
legs
which
were
swallowed
up
in
a
huge
pair
of
wooden
boots
iron
fastened
and
armed
with
long
rattling
spurs
his
shirt
collar
was
of
vast
dimensions
and
between
it
and
the
broad
brim
of
his
high
bell
crowned
varnished
hat
projected
an
eel
skin
queue
with
a
little
tuft
of
frizzled
hair
like
a
powder
puff
at
the
end
bobbing
up
and
down
with
the
motion
of
the
rider
and
scattering
a
white
cloud
around
him
the
horses
which
and
leather
and
in
the
most
uncouth
manner
imaginable
they
were
five
in
number
black
white
and
gray
as
various
in
size
as
in
color
their
tails
were
braided
and
tied
up
with
wisps
of
straw
and
when
the
postillion
mounted
and
cracked
his
heavy
whip
off
they
started
one
pulling
this
way
another
that
one
on
the
gallop
another
trotting
and
the
rest
dragging
along
at
a
scrambling
pace
between
a
trot
and
a
walk
no
sooner
did
the
vehicle
get
comfortably
in
motion
than
the
postillion
throwing
the
reins
upon
his
horse
s
neck
and
drawing
a
flint
and
steel
from
one

enlivened
by

of
peasants
driving
before

a

ass
laden
with

for

we
would

with
a
shaggy
dog
at

guarding
his

making

account
of
sir
george
downing
of
london
from
the
new

daily
advertiser
george
downing
was
born
in
london
in
and
accompanied
his
parents
to
this
country
when
about
thirteen
years
of
age
his
father
emanual
downing
a
great
friend
of
new
england
was
brother
in
law
to
john
winthrop
one
of
the
principal
founders
and
first
governor
of
massachusetts
george
received
his
education
at
harvard
college
about
he
returned
to
england
when
he
was
soon
brought
into
notice
being
as
gov
winthrop
says
a
very
able
scholar
and
of
ready
wit
and
fluent
utterance
he
was
appointed
chaplain
in
the
regiment
of
col
john
okey
in
the
army
of
lord
fairfax
who
had
command
of
the
parliament

was
commissary
general
and
about
the
same
time
scout
master
general
of
the
english
army
in
scotland
in
the
same
year
he
was
employed
in
negotiations
with
the
duke
of
savoy
he
seems
to
have
been
fitted
by
nature
for
scenes
of
political
manoeuvering
and
his
principles
were
of
such
any
service
which
the
times
required
in
he
visited
the
french
king
on
public
business
and
communicated
his
instructions
in
latin
in
he
was
appointed
minister
to
holland
in
march
while
in
that
country
in
order
to
show
his
zeal
and
love
for
his
majesty
he
procured
the
arrest
of
john
okey
miles
corbet
and
john
barkstead
three
of
the
judges
who
had
condemned
to
death
charles

had
been
the

served
in
his
regiment
as
chaplain
with
the
other
two
he
had
co
operated
in
the
cause
of
the
parliament
his
conduct
therefore
in
this
transaction
was
justly
reprobated
he
also
spake
of
cromwell
as
a
traitor
and
rebel
in
he
was
created
a
baronet
he
informed
pepys
that
when
in
holland
he
had
so
good
spys
that
he
hath
had
the
keys
taken
out
of
de

dutch

when
he
was
abed
and
left
in
his
hands
for
an
hour
and
carried
back
and
laid
in
the
place
again
and
the
keys
put
into
his
pocket
he
says
he
hath
had
their
most
private
debates
that
have
been
between
but
two
or
three
of
them
brought
to
him
and
in
an
hour
after
that
hath
sent
word
thereof
to
the
king
in
he
was
again
sent
to
holland
but
returning
before
he
had
executed
the
business
of
his
mission
to
the
satisfaction
of
the

imprisoned
in

was

acquired

curiosities

literature
have
passed
through
seven
or
eight
editions
in

the
author
has
not
skimmed
the
surface
of
things
and
collected
the
froth
but
he
has
brought
up
pearls
from
the
bottom
he
has
not
been
a
compiler
of
floating
gossip
but
has
laboriously
searched
among
forgotten
records
and
brought
together
facts
which
have
all
the
freshness
and
attraction
of
novelty
his
style
is
lively
and
vigorous
and
divested
of
that
antiquarian
pedantry
which
most

who
have
delved
awhile
among
hidden

seem
to
feel
themselves

are
invaluable
and

will
find
much
in

the
curiosities

are
absolutely
astonishing
mr

appears
to
be
master
of
all
languages
of
all
sciences
and
of
all
books
nothing
that
is
useful
nothing
that
is
useless
nothing
that
is

nothing
that
is
entertaining
nothing
that
is
tedious
seems
to
have
escaped
the
author
infinitely
agreeable
we
believe
all
the
libraries
in
the
world
may
safely
be
challenged
to
furnish
forth
a
book
which
contains
so
many
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
literature
and
learning
as
this
it
is
a
book
which
may
be
taken
up
and
laid
down
at
daily
with
the
best
of
us
and
the
least
fortunate
how
few
of
us
ever
dream
of
the
narrow
escapes
we
make
at
moments
when
a
breath
might
kill
us
when
the
pressure
of
a
bare
bodkin
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
send
us
to
sudden
judgment
and
the
outlaw
was
again
defeated
he
had
not
perhaps
been
scared
he
had
only
been
surprised
been
confounded
in
the
first
cry
of
the
bird
the
first
rush
of
his
wings
flapping
through
the
trees
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
swept
across
his
eyes
he
lowered
the
pistol
involuntarily
he
forgot
to
pull
the
trigger
and
when
he
recovered
himself
steed
and
rider
had
gone
beyond
his
reach
is
there
a
devil
he
involuntarily
murmured
that
stands
between
me
and
my
victim
am
i
to
be
baffled
always
is
in
stupor
and
vexation
he
could
hear
the
distant
tramp
of
the
horse
sinking
faintly
out
of
hearing
that
i
who
have
lived
in
the
woods
all
my
life
should
have
been
startled
by
an
owl
and
at
such
a
moment
cursing
the
youth
s
good
fortune
not
less
than
his
own
weakness
the
fierce
disappointment
of
guy
rivers
was
such
that
he
fairly
gnashed
his
teeth
with
vexation
at
first
he
thought
to
dash
after
his
victim
but
his
own
steed
had
been
fastened
near
the
cottage
several
hundred
yards
distant
and
he
was
winded
too
much
for
a
further
pursuit
that
night
colleton
was
meanwhile
a
mile
ahead
going
forward
swimmingly
never
once
dreaming
of
danger
he
was
thus
far
safe
so
frequently
and
completely
had
his
enemy
been
baffled
in
the
brief
progress
of
a
single
night
that
he
was
almost
led
to
believe
for
like
most
criminals
he
was
not
without
his
superstition
that
his
foe
was
under
some
special
guardianship
with
chapter
xxv
subdued
agonies
the
entrance
of
guy
rivers
awakened
no
emotion
among
the
inmates
of
the
dwelling
indeed
at
the
moment
it
was
almost
unperceived
the
young
woman
happened
to
be
in
close
attendance
upon
her
parent
for
such
the
invalid
was
and
did
not
observe
his
approach
while
he
stood
at
some
little
distance
from
the
couch
surveying
the
scene
the
old
lady
was
endeavoring
though
with
a
feebleness
that
grew
more
apparent
with
every
breath
to
articulate
something
to
which
she
seemed
to
attach
much
importance
in
the
ears
of
the
kneeling
girl
who
with
breathless
attention
seemed
desirous
of
making
it
out
but
in
vain
and
signifying
by
her
countenance
the
disappointment
which
she
felt
the
speaker
with
something
like
anger
shook
her
skinny
finger
feebly
in
her
face
and
the
broken
and
incoherent
words
with
rapid
effort
but
like
success
endeavored
to
find
their
way
through
the
half
closed
aperture
between
her
teeth
the
tears
fell
fast
and
neither
sobbed
nor
spoke
but
with
continued
and
yet
despairing
attention
endeavored
earnestly
to
catch
the
few
words
of
one
who
was
on
the
eve
of
departure
and
the
words
of
whom
at
such
a
moment
almost
invariably
acquire
a
value
never
attached
to
them
before
as
the
sounds
of
a
harp
when
the
chords
are
breaking
are
said
to
articulate
a
sweet
sorrow
as
if
in
mourning
for
their
own
fate
the
outlaw
all
this
while
stood
apart
and
in
silence
although
perhaps
but
little
impressed
with
the
native
solemnity
of
the
scene
before
him
he
was
not
so
ignorant
of
what
was
due
to
humanity
and
not
so
unfeeling
in
reference
to
the
parties
here
interested
as
to
seek
to
disturb
its
progress
or
propriety
with
tone
look
or
gesture
which
might
make
either
of
them
regret
his
presence
becoming
impatient
however
of
a
colloquy
which
as
he
saw
that
it
had
not
its
use
and
was
only
productive
of
mortification
to
one
of
he
advanced
toward
them
and
his
tread
for
the
first
time
warned
them
of
his
presence
with
an
effort
which
seemed
supernatural
the
dying
woman
raised
herself
with
a
sudden
start
in
the
bed
and
her
eyes
glared
upon
him
with
a
threatening
horror
and
her
lips
parting
disclosed
the
broken
and
decayed
teeth
beneath
ineffectually
gnashing
while
her
long
skinny
fingers
warned
him
away
all
this
time
she
appeared
to
speak
but
the
words
were
unarticulated
though
from
the
expression
of
every
feature
it
was
evident
that
indignation
and
reproach
made
up
the
entire
amount
of
everything
she
had
to
express
the
outlaw
was
not
easily
influenced
by
anger
so
impotent
as
this
and
from
his
manner
of
receiving
it
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
for
some
time
accustomed
to
a
reception
of
a
like
kind
from
the
same
person
he
approached
the
young
girl
who
had
now
risen
from
her
knees
and
spoke
to
her
in
words
of
comparative
kindness
well
am
glad
to
see
you
have
suffered
no
injury
how
happened
the
fire
the
young
woman
explained
the
cause
of
the
conflagration
and
narrated
in
brief
the
assistance
which
had
been
received
from
the
stranger
but
i
was
so
terrified
guy
she
added
that
i
had
not
presence
of
mind
enough
to
thank
him
and
what
should
be
the
value
of
your
spoken
thanks
ellen
the
stranger
if
he
have
sense
must
feel
that
he
has
them
and
the
utterance
of
such
things
had
better
be
let
alone
but
how
is
the
old
lady
now
i
see
she
loves
me
no
better
than
formerly
she
is
sinking
fast
guy
and
is
now
incapable
of
speech
before
you
came
she
seemed
desirous
of
saying
something
to
me
but
she
tried
in
vain
to
speak
and
now
i
scarcely
think
her
conscious
believe
it
not
ellen
she
is
conscious
of
all
that
is
going
on
though
now
fixed
upon
me
and
with
the
old
expression
she
would
tear
me
if
she
could
oh
think
not
thus
of
the
dying
guy
of
her
who
has
never
harmed
and
would
never
harm

the

inferior
to

the

avoiding
therefore
the
abstruse
niceties
and
the
transcendental

has
nevertheless
produced
a
volume

fully
persuaded
to
impress
upon
his

the
magnitude
and
importance
of

by
the

that
there
was
nothing
in

manner
of

him
during

approaching
levity

any
thing
that
indicated

much

is

this
is
a
very
valuable

interesting

thence

order
directly
up

not

disturbing
the
silence

the
funerallike
procession

various
colours
of
their
plumes

they
waved
in

night

one
of
the
most
striking
scenes

general
bacon
assumed
the
immediate
command
of
his
columns
in
person
he
sat
upon
his
impatient
charger
on
the
right
wing
and
examined
the
ominous
appearance
of
the
enemy
s
camp
with
intense
interest
not
a
warrior
s
head
was
to
be
seen
above
the
breastwork
as
they
approached
all
was
silent
gloomy
and
portentous
not
a
sound
was
heard
as
they
moved
through
the
bushes
once
indeed
he
thought
he
heard
the
wild
shrill
scream
of
a
female
very
different
in
its
intonations
from
the
harsh
voice
of
the
savage
squaw
but
so
many
unearthly
sights
and
sounds
had
haunted
both
his
sleeping
and
waking
hours
of
late
that
he
drove
the
impression
from
his
mind
to
rest
with
hundreds
of
others
of
like
import
when
the
front
lines
had
arrived
within
some
forty
yards
of
the
dark
and
frowning
breastwork
a
sudden
and
momentary
check
was
given
to
their
farther
progress
a
rushing
sound
as
of
the
flight
of
many
birds
and
the
clatter
of
indian
arrows
against
their
arms
and
persons
simultaneously
struck
upon
their
senses
followed
by
the
fall
of
many
soldiers
and
the
short
nvoluntary
exclamations
of
pain
which
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment
escaped
the
unfortunate
individuals
trumpets
and
drums
instantaneously
broke
the
stillness
of
the
march
their
martial
notes
reverberated
over
the
surrounding
solitudes
in
enlivening
peals
the
ill
omened
birds
of
night
flapped
their
scene
in
utter
dismay
at
this
untimely
invasion
of
their
prescriptive
dominions
these
were
quickly
followed
by
a
discharge
of
musketry
poured
into
the
formidable
palisade
it
was
scarcely
discharged
however
before
bacon
discovered
the
utter
uselessness
of
such
a
waste
of
ammunition
he
saw
that
the
breastwork
was
so
constructed
that
while
it
admitted
of
the
discharge
of
missiles
from
within
it
afforded
a
secure
protection
to
its
occupants
against
the
musketry
of
their
assailants
in
the
mean
time
his
soldiers
were
exposed
to
the
murderous
discharges
of
poisoned
arrows
in
this
emergency
no
time
was
to
be
lost
placing
himself
therefore
at
the
head
of
his
troops
he
ordered
the
walls
to
be
torn
down
these
as
before
related
were
composed
of
large
trees
piled
one
upon
another
with
their
green
boughs
still
protruding
in
many
places
over
the
shallow
intrenchment
and
the
earth
excavated
from
the
latter
thrown
up
on
the
outside
agaist
a
rude
wicker
work
of
fine
bushes
filling
up
the
interstices
of
the
moved
at
a
quick
pace
to
the
onset
still
not
a
savage
head
was
seen
until
they
had
arrived
at
the
very
borders
of
the
intrenchment
here
some
two
hundred
of
the
stoutest
and
ablest
bodied
of
his
soldiers
were
marched
up
to
the
projecting
limbs
of
the
largest
tree
forming
the
basis
of
the
breastwork
bacon
saw
at
a
glance
that
if
he
could
manage
to
seize
hold
of
these
projecting
arms
and
turn
the
tree
across
the
fosse
it
would
at
once
open
the
way
for
his
mounted
troops
and
perhaps
carry
with
it
some
forty
or
fifty
feet
of
the
palisade
and
thereby
bring
the
opposing
armies
face
to
face
they
had
already
seized
the
projecting
limbs
and
were
shaking
the
frail
protection
of
the
savages
to
its
very
foundations
when
simultaneously
a
thousand
lights
gleamed
over
forest
hill
and
dale
a
thousand
voices
united
their
shrill
clamours
in
one
deafening
yell
of
savage
ferocity
the
troops
engaged
in
tearing
down
the
breastwork
instinctively
loosed
their
hold
and
flew
to
their
arms
these
blinding
lights
and
deafening
noises
came
it
was
but
the
work
of
an
instant
for
little
more
time
were
they
permitted
to
examine
they
were
called
upon
to
act
and
that
vigorously
for
their
own
preservation
in
a
single
instant
and
apparently
at
a
given
signal
the
whole
of
the
rude
terrace
surmounting
the
fortification
literally
swarmed
with
painted
warriors
each
bearing
in
his
left
hand
a
pine
torch
and
in
the
other
a
tomahawk
a
war
club
or
a
battle
axe
they
sprang
from
their
commanding
position
into
the
midst
of
their
assailants
and
scattered
themselves
in
every
direction
through
that
part
of
the
army
already
advanced
to
the
breastwork
human
ingenuity
could
not
have
devised
a
mode
of
warfare
better
calculated
to
suit
their
numbers
position
time
courage
and
limited
means
of
resistance
it
at
once
rendered
the
mounted
troops
useless
prevented
the
colonists
from
using
their
fire
arms
because
those
immediately
engaged
were
at
too
close
quarters
while
those
at
a
greater
distance
were
as
likely
to
blows
with
wonderous
rapidity
and
precision
and
though
the
hardy
planters
in
the
front
ranks
turned
upon
them
with
the
butt
ends
of
their
muskets
the
savages
had
evidently
the
advantage
the
blazing
fagots
were
often
thrust
into
the
very
faces
of
their
opponents
and
while
writhing
under
the
confusion
and
agony
of
the
fire
and
smoke
they
were
stricken
down
like
helpless
beasts
bacon
saw
the
imminent
peril
of
his
troops
and
though
he
was
at
first
astounded
by
the
rapidity
and
daring
courage
with
which
the
plan
was
executed
he
did
not
despair
nor
yet
sit
listlessly
upon
his
horse
to
see
his
friends
and
countrymen
slaughtered
he
saw
at
a
glance
too
that
only
the
front
columns
were
engaged
that
a
part
of
these
must
now
necessarily
fall
but
he
determined
at
the
same
time
that
their
deaths
should
be
dearly
avenged
and
his
remaining
troops
brought
off
victorious
he
immediately
placed
himself
between
the
forces
already
engaged
and
those
rushing
to
the
rescue
the
latter
he
wheeled
into
line
immediately
in
to
the
flank
of
the
contending
man
major
and
ai
nt
afeard
to
change
my
opinion
now
this
is
the
gineral
all
over
and
i
am
off
to
morrow
to
philadelphia
and
if
i
do
nt
give
mr
biddle
and
his
money
bags
a
stirring
up
i
m
mistaken
there
is
no
one
thing
i
m
so
cute
at
as
looking
through
accounts
i
showed
that
once
as
clear
as
a
whistle
when
i
settled
the
first
mackerel
voyage
of
the
two
pollies
capt
jumper
there
were
nine
owners
and
three
on
em
found
the
riggin
and
the
other
six
built
the
hull
and
the
captain
fitted
her
out
and
was
to
get
every
seventeenth
fish
for
his
share
extra
for
his
services
each
one
was
to
draw
his
share
according
to
amount
and
sarvices
it
was
all
strait
enuff
only
some
of
the
riggin
was
taken
from
the
amiable
mahitable
the
riggin
part
of
which
was
paid
back
by
capt
jumper
they
puzzled
at
a
settlement
all
winter
but
i
saw
thru
it
in
a
minute
and
made
it
all
as
strait
as
a
loon
s
leg
i
showed
the
gineral
the
accounts
one
day
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
why
he
wants
me
to
look
into
the
bank
i
ll
tell
you
more
about
it
to

i
have
just
got
here
after
examin
in
the
bank
and
it
was
the
toughest
job
i
ever
had
in
my
life
the
gineral
was
so
bent
on
my
doing
it
that
i
had
to
go
ahead
or
i
d
sneak
d
out
the
first
day
i
was
nigh
upon
a
week
about
it
figerin
and
siferin
all
the
while
mr
biddle
see
quick
enuff
it
was
made
some
of
his
folks
scratch
their
heads
i
tell
you
i
gin
em
no
notice
of
my
comin
and
i
jump
d
right
in
the
thickest
on
em
there
one
day
when
they
were
tumblin
in
and
shellin
out
the
money
like
corn
now
says
i
my
boys
i
advise
all
on
ye
to
brush
up
your
multiplication
tables
for
i
am
down
upon
you
with
aligation
and
the
rule
of
and
vulgar
fractions
and
if
i
find
a
penny
out
of
place
the
gineral
shall
know
it
i
m
no
green
horn
nor
member
of
congress
nor
judge
clayton
nor
mr
cambreleng
neither
says
i
as
soon
as
mr
biddle
read
the
letter
the
gineral
sent
by
me
says
he
major
i
m
glad
the
gineral
has
sent
some
one
at
last
that
knows
something
and
can
give
a
strait
account
and
with
that
he
call
d
all
the
bank
folks
and
tell
d
em
to
bring
their
books
together
now
at
first
it
makes
no
odds
which
says
i
all
i
care
about
is
to
see
if
both
eends
meet
and
if
they
do
nt
mr
biddle
says
i
its
all
over
with
you
and
the
bank
you
ll
all
go
hook
and
line
and
then
we
off
coats
and
went
at
it
i
found
some
of
them
ere
fellows
there
plaguy
sharp
at
siferin
they
d
do
a
sum
by
a
kinder
short
dilworth
quick
as
a
flash
i
always
use
a
slate
it
comes
kinder
natural
to
me
and
i
chalk
d
her
off
there
the
first
day
and
figur
d
out
nigh
upon
pretty
considerable
tuff
sums
there
was
more
than
cart
load
of
books
about
us
and
every
one
on
em
bigger
than
the
deacon
s
family
bible
and
such
an
etarnal
batch
of
figerin
i
never
see
and
there
war
nt
a
blot
or
a
scratch
in
the
hull
on
em
i
put
a
gin
me
a
long
string
on
em
and
i
thought
some
would
stagger
him
but
he
answered
them
all
just
as
glib
as
our
boys
in
downingville
do
the
catakize
from
the
chief
eend
of
man
clean
through
the
petitions
and
he
did
it
all
in
a
mighty
civil
way
too
there
was
only
one
he
kinder
tried
to
git
round
and
that
was
how
he
came
to
have
so
few
of
the
gineral
s
folks
among
the
dirictors
until
very
lately
why
says
he
major
and
major
says
he
and
then
he
got
up
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
offered
me
one
says
he
major
the
bank
knows
no
party
and
in
the
first
go
off
you
know
the
gineral
s
friends
were
all
above
matters
of
so
little
importance
as
banks
and
banking
if
we
had
put
a
branch
in
downingville
says
he
the
gineral
would
not
have
had
occasion
to
ask
such
a
question
i
went
home
and
took
dinner
with
him
it
is
plaguy
curious
to
hear
him
talk
about
millions
and
thousands
and
i
got
as
glib
too
at
it
as
he
is
and
how
on
earth
i
shall
git
back
again
to
ninepences
and
fourpence
happenies
i
ca
nt
tell
after
i
had
been
figerin
away
there
nigh
upon
a
week
and
used
up
or
slate
pencils
and
spit
my
mouth
as
dry
as
a
cob
rubbin
out
the
sums
as
fast
as
i
did
them
i
writ
to
the
gineral
and
tell
d
him
it
was
no
use
i
could
find
no
mistake
but
so
long
as
the
bank
was
at
work
it
was
pretty
much
like
counting
a
flock
of
sheep
in
a
fall
day
when
they
are
just
let
into
a
new
stubble
for
it
was
all
the
while
crossing
and
mixing
and
the
only
way
was
to
lock
up
all
the
banks
and
as
fast
as
you
count
em
black
their
noses
now
says
i
one
look
at
your
money
bags
for
they
tell
the
gineral
you
ha
nt
got
stuff
enuff
in
the
bank
to
make
him
a
pair
of
spectacles
none
of
your
rags
says
i
but
the
real
grit
and
with
that
he
call
d
or
the
latitude
of
eighteen
north
and
one
hundred
and
fifteen
degrees
west
of
greenwich
consequently
she
was
in
the
pacific
ocean
and
not
far
from
the
west
coast
of
mexico
the
north
east
trade
wind
which
is
generally
almost
due
east
was
sufficiently
free
to
allow
her
to
carry
her
starboard
studding
sails
under
which
she
flew
gracefully
and
swiftly
on
her
appointed
course
the
weather
as
usual
within
the
limits
of
either
trade
wind
was
extremely
beautiful
and
mild
the
heat
that
on
shore
in
the
same
latitude
would
have
been
excessive
was
moderated
by
the
refreshing
breeze
indeed
it
has
never
been
my
lot
to
find
such
lovely
weather
we
meet
with
through
the
whole
course
of
the
trade
winds
the
long
regular
swell
so
peculiar
to
that
part
of
the
ocean
gave
the
noble
ship
a
peculiarly
easy
rolling
motion
extremely
grateful
to
a
seaman
as
the
regularity
and
length
of
the
swell
is
a
certain
indication
of
a
continuance
of
good
weather
as
she
lifted
her
huge
bows
above
the
foaming
sparkling
wave
her
bright
copper
polished
by
dashing
so
long
and
so
fast
through
the
water
flashed
in
the
sunbeams
like
burnished
gold
at
the
same
time
her
temporary
and
partial
elevation
above
the
surface
revealed
a
sharpness
of
model
below
the
water
s
edge
that
at
once
accounted
for
the
graceful
and
majestic
swiftness
of
her
motion
the
whiteness
of
her
canvass
and
her
bright
varnished
sides
sufficiently
indicated
her
to
be
a
yankee
without
the
trouble
of
hoisting
the
gridiron
her
stern
flared
a
great
deal
that
is
its
outline
formed
a
very
acute
angle
with
the
horizon
it
was
ornamented
with
a
great
profusion
of
carved
work
some
of
which
was
hieroglyphical
to
a
degree
that
would
have
puzzled
champollion
but
over
the
centre
were
two
figures
in
bas
relief
that
could
not
well
be
mistaken
inasmuch
as
the
sword
and
scales
plainly
indicated
that
the
one
on
the
starboard
side
was
justice
while
the
cap
on
the
point
of
a
lance
seemed
to
fructify
that
her
companion
was
no
other
than
miss
liberty
liberty

bare
headed
now
our
rulers
wisely
reflecting
that
she
is
upwards
of
fifty
years
old
and
has
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
have
ordered
her
to
leave
off
her
child
s
cap
there
are
among
us
those
who
think
that
the
stripping
will
go
further
and
that
in
a
short
time
she
will
be
as
bare
as

the
noses
of
both
goddesses
had
been
knocked
off
shortly
after
they
condescended
to
mount
guard
on
the
stern
of
the
good
ship
albatross
in
consequence
of
coming
into
frequent
collision
with
the
gunwale
of
the
her
station
at
the
stern
davits
at
her
quarter
davits
on
each
side
hung
one
of
those
light
swift
and
somewhat
singularly
shaped
boats
called
whale
boats
eight
iron
nine
pounders
on
each
side
thrust
their
black
muzzles
through
their
respective
ports
and
gave
her
in
spite
of
her
bright
varnished
sides
a
warlike
appearance
the
upper
part
of
her
cut
water
was
fashioned
into
a
scroll
like
the
volute
of
an
ionic
pillar
forming
what
is
called
by
naval
architects
a
billet
head
and
which
for
its
neatness
and
beauty
is
very
generally
adopted
both
in
national
vessels
and
merchantmen
nor
was
the
bow
without
its
share
of
hieroglyphics
on
one
side
were
displayed
a
bee

a
bale
of
cotton
and
a
crate
of
crockery
and
on
the
other
a

anchor
a

and
a

set
flying
a
technicality
that
i
shall
not
attempt
to
explain
she

no

forty
years
since
carried
no

as
were
stout
enough
to
carry

upon
in

or
foul

sail
masts
and
other
useless
sticks
were
as
much
unknown
to

as

upon

attached
to
the
companion
or
entrance
to
the
cabin
with
spectacles
on
nose
and
a
well
worn
bible
on
his
knees
sat
an
elderly
man
the
commander
of
the
ship
he
was
tall
and
very
strongly
built
long
exposure
to
the
weather
in
every
variety
of
climate
had
bronzed
his
countenance
and
given
him
an
older
look
than
his
real
years
would
have
done
under
other
circumstances
but
at
the
same
time
long
exposure
to
the
weather
had
hardened
his
frame
and
strengthened
his
constitution
points
of
some
importance
forty
life
were
much
better
than
those
of
a
man
of
forty
especially
one
of
modern
date
who
had
never
allowed
the
winds
of
heaven
to
visit
his
face
too
roughly
his
age
was
in
short
about
sixty
his
countenance
notwithstanding
the
rude
and
ungenteel
manner
with
which
the
winds
and
the
weather
had
treated
it
was
indicative
of
much
good
nature
and
benevolence
of
disposition
he
raised
his
head
from
time
to
time
looked
aloft
at
the
sails
occasionally
addressed
a
word
or
two
to
the
mate
of
the
watch
who
was
walking
fore
and
aft
the
quarter
deck
and
then
resumed
his
reading
in
the
weather
mizen
shrouds
was
a
remarkably
handsome
young
man
of
four
or
five
and
twenty
busily
engaged
in
hanging
out
to
air
his
go
ashore
clothes
a
very
common
sunday
morning
occupation
at
sea
when
the
weather
is
fine
apparently
the
sight
of
his
gay
garments
had
called
up
a
train
of
ideas
of
a
very
varied
and
checkered
hue
to
judge
from
the
different
one
moment
shaded
with
anxiety
and
doubt
at
another
bright
with
hope
and
joy
in
height
he
was
about
five
feet
eight
or
nine
inches
strongly
and
compactly
built
but
far
too
stout
and
athletic
too
broad
shouldered
and
thin
flanked
to
pass
muster
as
an
exquisite
in
broadway
and
a
sort
of
wall
composed
of
smaller
fragments
ran
from
the
one
crag
to
the
other
yet
so
rudely
that
been
piled
up
by
the
hands
of
nature
or
man
besides
a
majestic
growth
of
trees
behind
and
around
the
rocks
there
was
one
tall
beech
flourishing
within
the
enclosure
and
from
its
roots
there
gushed
a
cool
fountain
that
went
dripping
and
leaking
through
green
mosses
until
it
yielded
its
meager
tribute
to
the
streamlet
both
the
crags
were
overgrown
with
lichens
and
ferns
and
under
the
larger
one
which
in
the
afternoon
cast
its
shadow
over
the
whole
nook
there
flourished
a
luxuriant
array
of
arums
mandrakes
violets
and
other
plants
that
delight
in
cool
and
moist
situations
on
the
face
and
at
the
foot
of
the
castern
rock
where
the
sunshine
lingered
longer
were
dusky
columbines
rock
daisies
and
other
plants
now
in
bloom
and
in
the
summer
their
places
would
have
been
supplied
by
the
aster
and
the
golden
rod
and
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
among
a
heap
of
brambles
that
seemed
to
have
almost
choked
it
there
being
obviously
of
an
exotic
species
it
bore
a
single
flower
visible
among
the
green
leaves
and
white
blossoms
of
the
black
berry
and
it
immediately
attracted
the
notice
of
the
maidens
elsie
told
me
whispered
catherine
with
a
voice
of
fear
that
the
poor
old
father
planted
a
rose
bush
on
the
grave
it
is
strange
it
should
live
so
long
she
said
there
was
a
grave
stone
too
ah
there
it
is
let
us
go
away
as
harriet
bolder
than
her
friend
or
affecting
to
be
so
reached
forward
to
remove
the
brier
from
the
more
lovely
plant
in
hopes
that
the
rude
and
thorny
veil
might
conceal
other
flowers
it
yielded
to
her
grasp
and
revealed
a
hollow
or
sunken
place
in
the
ground
at
one
extremity
of
which
was
a
rude
stone
entirely
shapeless
and
undressed
yet
so
placed
as
to
mark
undeniably
the
couch
of
some
human
clod
of
the
valley
no
name
letter
or
device
virtues
of
the
dead
no
legend
to
perpetuate
the
grief
of
the
living
appeared
on
the
rude
monument
and
indeed
however
expressive
the
shape
and
appearance
of
the
hollow
place
to
those
already
aware
that
a
grave
had
been
dug
in
this
unsanctified
nook
it
is
scarce
probable
that
a
stranger
stumbling
upon
it
by
chance
could
have
believed
that
in
that
coarse
and
dishonoured
fragment
his
foot
pressed
upon
a
funeral
stone
it
was
a
singular
grave
it
was
a
singular
cemetery
and
the
maidens
regarded
the
brambled
pit
and
the
solitary
flower
with
awe
the
one
because
her
spirit
was
especially
susceptible
of
impressions
from
melancholy
objects
and
the
other
because
the
legend
of
her
companion
had
invested
the
place
with
an
interest
personal
it
might
be
said
to
herself
how
little
reflection
is
expended
upon
yet
how
much
is
called
for
by
the
grave
by
the
lowliest
hillock
that
is
piled
over
the
icy
bosom
by
the
grassiest
hollow
that
has
sunk
with
the
narrow
haven
rots
the
bark
that
has
ploughed
the
surges
of
the
great
vital
ocean
in
this
little
den
that
the
thistle
can
overshadow
in
a
day
s
growth
and
the
molewarp
undermine
in
an
hour
of
labour
is
crushed
the
spirit
that
could
enthrall
a
world
and
dare
even
a
contest
with
destiny
how
little
it
speaks
for
the
value
of
the
existence
which
man
endures
so
many
evils
to
prolong
how
much
it
reduces
the
significance
of
both
the
pomp
and
wretchedness
of
being
reducing
all
its
vicissitudes
into
the
indistinguishable
identity
which
infinite
distance
gives
to
the
stars
a
point
without
parallax
a
speck
an
atom
such
is
life
the
gasp
of
a
child
that
inspires
the
air
of
existence
but
once
a
single
breath
breathed
from
eternity
but
the
destiny
that
comes
behind
us
oblivion
it
is
not
enough
that
we
moralize
upon
the
equality
of
the
sepulchre
that
the
rich
man
whose
soul
is
in
the
ostentation
of
a
marble
palace
should
consider
how
small
a
pit
must
content
him
or
that
the
proud
who
boast
their
pre
eminence
above
the
beasts
should
know
that
the
shaggy
carcass
and
the
lawn
shrouded
corse
must
fatten
the
earth
together
we
should
teach
our
vanity
the
lesson
of
humiliation
that
is
afforded
by
the
grave
neglecting
the
mighty
mausoleums
of
those
marvellous
spirits
which
fame
has
rendered
immortal
we
should
turn
to
the
nameless
tombs
of
the
million
and
in
their
deserted
obscurity
discover
the
feeble
hold
which
we
ourselves
must
have
upon
earth
and
the
memory
of
men
friendship
forgets
what
the
devouring
earth
has
claimed
and
even
enmity
ceases
at
last
to
remember
the
resting
place
of
a
foe
love
ourselves
as
we
may
devote
our
affections
to
others
as
we
can
yet
must
our
memory
perish
with
us
in
the
grave
and
all
the
immortality
we
leave
to
be
cherished
among
friends
is
expressed
in
the
distich
of
a
poet
whom
the
anticipation
of
enduring
renown
could
not
blind
to
the
transitoriness
of
real
remembrance
week
and
arbuthnot
a
day
but
there
were
other
thoughts
necessarily
associated
and
other
feelings
excited
by
this
lonely
sepulchre
and
while
miss
falconer
preserved
a
moody
and
painful
silence
upon
its
brink
catherine
bent
over
it
scarce
conscious
that
she
bedewed
the
rose
bush
with
a
tear
or
that
her
own
shadow
had
descended
as
it
were
into
the
pit
with
an
ominous
readiness
it
was
a
delightful
evening
the
air
was
full
of
balmy
freshness
the
landscape
resplendently
verdant
and
the
sky
cloudless
save
in
the
west
where
the
sun
was
sinking
among
curtains
of
gold
and
pillars
of
flame
and
the
solitude
and
quiet
of
the
whole
scene
broken
by
no
sounds
except
the
ceaseless
turmoil
of
the
water
fall
and
the
plaintive
scream
of
the
fishing
eagles
which
had
deserted
their
gray
perch
to
bathe
in
the
pure
floods
of
sunset
that
replied
summoning
her
resolution
and
speaking
firmly
and
thou
seest
me
thus
degraded
not
in
thine
imagination
only
but
in
the
suspicions
of
all
down
to
the
level
of
scorn
yes
she
continued
bitterly
and
while
thou
pitiest
me
for
a
shame
endured
only
for
thyself
endured
only
that
i
may
requite
thee
with
life
for
life
thou
art
sorry
thy
hand
ever
snatched
me
from
the
billows
speak
juan
lerma
is
it
not
so
it
had
been
better
magdalena
besides
that
the
act
caused
me
to
be
stained
with
blood
it
afflicts
me
with
a
curse
still
more
heavy
i
do
not
mourn
the
death
of
hilario
as
i
mourn
the
downfall
of
one
whom
i
once
esteemed
almost
a
seraph
villain
that
he
was
cried
magdalena
with
vindictive
impetuosity
mean
and
malignant
in
life
and
in
death
who
with
a
lie
living
destroyed
the
peace
and
the
fame
of
the
friendless
and
died
with
a
lie
that
both
might
remain
blighted
for
ever
o
wretch
o
wretch
there
is
no
punishment
for
him
among
the
fiends
for
he
was
of
their
nature
and
thou
mournest
his
death
too
thou
cursest
the
hand
that
avenged
the
wrong
of
a
feeble
woman
i
lament
that
i
slew
the
son
of
my
benefactor
said
juan
with
a
deep
sigh
and
then
added
with
one
still
deeper
but
sinner
that
i
am
i
rejoice
while
looking
on
the
destroyer
of
innocence
the
destroyer
of
innocence
indeed
replied
magdalena
with
a
voice
broken
and
suffocating
yes
innocence
she
exclaimed
more
wildly
or
at
least
the
fame
of
innocence
for
innocence
herself
he
could
not
harm
no
by
heaven
oh
no
for
what
i
came
from
the
sea
that
i
am
now
yes
now
i
tell
thee
now
and
if
thou
darest
give
tongue
to
aught
else
if
thou
darest
think
oh
heaven
this
is
more
than
i
can
bear
say
juan
lerma
say
dost
thou
too
believe
me
the
thing
i
am
called
the
base
the
fallen
the
degraded
alas
magdalena
replied
juan
to
the
wild
demand
with
his
dying
lips
hilario
with
his
dying
lips
he
perjured
his
soul
for
ever
exclaimed
magdalena
for
ever
for
ever
she
went
may
the
curse
of
a
broken
hearted
woman
destroyed
by
his
defaming
malice
cling
to
him
as
long
scorching
him
with
fresh
torments
even
when
fiends
grow
relentful
and
forbearing
mountains
of
fire
requite
the
coals
he
has
thrown
upon
my
bosom
may
god
never
forgive
him
no
never
never
this
is
horrid
said
juan
revoke
thy
malediction
it
is
impiety
alas
alas
he
continued
moved
with
compassion
as
the
singular
being
passing
at
once
from
a
sibyl
like
rage
to
the
deepest
and
most
feminine
abasement
of
grief
wrung
her
hands
and
sobbed
aloud
and
bitterly
would
indeed
that
thou
hadst
perished
with
the
others
would
that
i
had
said
magdalena
more
calmly
but
thou
hadst
then
been
left
to
a
malice
like
that
which
has
slain
me
no
not
like
that
for
it
is
content
with
thy
life
i
would
ask
thee
more
of
myself
she
went
on
but
it
needs
not
if
i
can
show
thee
thou
wrongest
me
concerning
hilario
canst
thou
not
believe
i
may
be
even
here
without
stain
well
i
care
not
one
day
thou
wilt
know
thou
hast
wronged
me
but
let
the
shame
rest
upon
me
now
for
it
needs
i
should
think
not
of
myself
but
of
thee
listen
to
me
juan
lerma
for
fallen
or
not
yet
am
i
thine
only
friend
among
a
thousand
enemies
give
up
thy
service
thy
hopes
of
fame
and
fortune
in
this
land
and
leave
it
leave
mexico
return
to
the
islands
thou
hast
marvellously
escaped
a
death
subtly
and
cruelly
designed
and
now
thou
art
destined
to
an
end
as
vengeful
and
perhaps
even
more
inevitable
yet
there
is
one
way
of
escape
and
there
is
one
moment
to
take
advantage
of
it
leave
mexico
cortes
is
thy
foe
leave
mexico
these
are
but
wild
words
magdalena
said
do
much
to
remove
thee
from
a
situation
the
thought
whereof
is
bitterer
to
me
than
my
own
misfortunes
wouldst
thou
said
magdalena
eagerly
go
then
and
i
go
likewise
go
then
and
know
that
thy
departure
not
only
releases
me
from
a
situation
of
disgrace
but
enables
me
to
make
clear
a
reputation
which
thou
yes
thou
believest
to
be
sullied
and
lost
i
am
not
what
i
seem
saints
of
heaven
that
i
should
have
to
say
it
but
by
the
grave
of
my
mother
i
swear
juan
lerma
thou
doest
me
as
deep
a
wrong
as
others
leave
this
land
and
thou
shalt
see
that
the
fame
of
an
angel
is
not
purer
than
mine
own
scorned
name
no
by
heaven
no
freer
from
a
deserved
shame
thou
shakest
thy
head
i
could
kill
thee
juan
lerma
i
could
kill
thee
she
went
on
with
a
strange
mingling
of
thee
for
i
have
not
deserved
this
of
thee
then
changing
her
tone
and
clasping
her
hands
submissively
she
said
but
think
not
of
me
or
rather
continue
to
think

the
reader
of
the
following
pages
by
which
he
may
find
his
way
through
the
mazes
of
this
almost
forgotten
period
the
ensuing
chapters
were
written
immediately
after
the
occurrence
of
the
events
to
which
they
relate
many
of
them
almost
contemporaneously
the
only
judgment
i
can
form
of
the
influence
they
may
exercise
on
the
minds
of
others
is
from
that
which
they
possess
on
my
own
from
having
perused
them
this
morning
distant
as
is
their
date
and
widely
as
i
feel
my
own
character
to
have
been
changed
in
the
interim
i
have
returned
as
it
were
to
the
very
days
of
my
prime
the
actors
are
before
my
eyes
i
can
hear
their
voices
i
can
read
their
countenances
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
am
unwilling
to
change
a
word
even
for
the
improvement
of
the
style
much
of
the
language
is
even
now
becoming
antiquated
and
ere
mysons
shall
be
of
age
to
read
them
will
probably
be
obsolete
there
is
nevertheless
am
loath
to
alter
fearing
lest
by
over
polishing
the
blade
i
may
wear
away
a
something
of
its
sterling
metal
as
it
is
i
commit
it
to
the
hands
of
posterity
only
reminding
those
who
may
perchance
take
it
up
to
kill
a
heavy
hour
that
the
writer
was
one
in
his
day
more
ready
with
the
sword
than
the
pen
and
that
to
him

and
the
internal
evidence
contained
in
the
whole
work
that
the
writer
was
deeply
engaged
in
the
conflicts
which
he
describes
go
far
to
prove
that
the
great
historian
hume
in
falling
into
the
same
mode
of
expression
must
have
plagiarised

in
mockery
over
the
chilled
and
cheerless
world
which
at
that
season
of
the
year
they
can
neither
fertilize
nor
beautify
a
thick
raw
mist
was
drawn
like
a
curtain
over
the
universal
face
of
nature
the
skies
looked
blank
and
dismal
there
was
not
a
cloud
of
darker
hue
not
a
speck
of
light
however
pale
to
relieve
the
solid
wall
of
dull
gray
fog
which
limited
the
view
to
a
dozen
feet
around
me
the
air
was
piercingly
cold

perfectly

so

ringing

of

the
hard
soil
might
have
been
heard
at
a
mile

distance
while
the
moisture
of
the
atmosphere
hung
in
wreaths
of
hoary
rime
not
only
my
eyebrows
and
on
the
floating
locks
which
at
the
period
i
speak
of
were
cultivated
with
peculiar
care
as
the
distinctive
marks
of
gentle
blood
indeed
so
bitter
was
the
morning
and
so
dreary
the
prospect
that
lay
before
me
that
i
almost
blamed
myself
for
having
quitted
the
cabin
in
which
i
had
passed
the
preceding
night
although
the
motives
for
my
expedition
were
in
the
highest
degree
pressing
and
important
what
those
motives
were
employed
as
i
now
am
in
the
relation
of
an
event
which
bearing
in
no
single
point
upon
any
portion
of
my
past
time
produced
effects
the
most
striking
on
my
after
life
i
am
not
at
present
inclined
to
relate
nor
is
it
probable
that
my
readers
would
find
much
either
of
profit
or
of
pleasure
in
the
perusal
of
occurrences
so
intimately
connected
with
facts
which
have
already
become
history
as
to
baffle
all
attempts
at
unravelling
them
from
the
skein
in
which
their
humble
thread
is
blended
suffice
it
to
say
i
education
association
or
prejudice
if
you
will
a
cavalier
yes
with
my
eyes
fully
open
to
the
danger
and
iniquity
of
those
arbitrary
doctrines
whether
of
church
or
state
which
had
filled
the
green
homes
of
my
native
land
with
misery
and
with
blood
perfectly
conscious
of
the
inability
of
the
king
to
be
a
governor
of
freeborn
men
i
had
yet
drawn
my
sword
in
every
skirmish
from
the
first
unfolding
of
the
banners
of
rebellion
to
the
final
triumph
of
the
commonwealth
on
the
scaffold
of
whitehall
an
ardent
adorer
of
freedom
in
the
abstract
i
had
lent
all
the
energies
of
my
mind
all
the
powers
of
my
arm
to
establish
a
tyranny
which
at
a
later
period
of
my
life
i
should
probably
with
equal
zeal
have
striven
to
overthrow
dazzled
by
the
influences
of
those
splendid
associations
by
that
almost
religious
veneration
for
ancient
institutions
merely
because
they
are
ancient
and
by
that
false
glare
of
nobility
of
accomplishment
and
of
chivalrous
royal
cause
behind
a
halo
no
less
delusive
than
it
was
brilliant
i
had
surrendered
my
mind
to
the
romantic
rather
than
to
the
rational
the
cry
of
patriotism
was
no
less
alive
in
the
mouths
of
one
than
of
the
other
party
and
if
liberty
were
the
magic
sound
which
swelled
the
chorus
of
the
victors
there
were
still
many
among
the
vanquished
to
whom
the
shout
of
loyalty
appeared
to
become
the
mouth
as
well
thus
was
it
then
with
me
i
had
fared
hardly
fought
hardly
and
gained
small
reward
save
hard
blows
i
had
not
it
is
true
served
through
the
desperate
fights
of

learned
his
more
than
fiendish
wickedness
i
have
learned
from
his
own
lips
that
he
has
broken
the
condition
on
which
alone
i
hold
my
voluntary
oath
to
be
binding
he
has
again
compassed
your
assassination
thanks
be
to
the
almighty
that
he
succeeded
not
in
his
fell
purpose
therefore
i
am
here
here
in
the
nunnery

scarce
thrice
have
i
seen
you
at
a
distance

you
perhaps

not

no
no

is
the
mere
waywardness
of

believe
it
not
that
you
ever
have
forgotten
ever

forget
i
know
not
whether
i
may
find
means
to
convey
this
to
your
hands
but
i
trust
that
he
who
hath
thus
far
preserved
will
now
deliver

you
receive
this

my
mind
had
devoured
the
contents
before
my
eye
had
perused

tenth

of

letter

of
my
fathers
what
were
then
my
sensations
my
gratitude
to
thee

anxiety

at

of

or

and
leave
all
i
repeated
the
stirring
words
aloud
i
sprang
to
my
feet
buckled
my
rapier
to
my
side
inspected
my
good
weapons
with
a
deep
and
joyous
satisfaction
i
rushed
out
into
the
nightly
camp
it
was
already
long
past
midnight
so
long
a
time
had
i
an
hour
of
the
time
appointed
for
the
movement
of
the
troops
they
were
already
stirring
i
hurried
to
the
quarters
of
d
erlach
commanded
him
to
hasten
his
arrangements
i
passed
among
the
men
with
a
word
of
encouragement
a
word
of
heart
stirring
praise
to
each
and
all
my
very
being
was
set
upon
the
cast
and
win
or
die
it
should
be
played
for
nobly
not
a
torch
was
kindled
not
a
trumpet
blown
the
orderlies
of
the
arquebusiers
alone
bore
darkened
lanterns
whence
to
distribute
fire
for
the
matchlocks
when
the
time
should
arrive
silently
steadily
but
cheerily
withal
did
the
men
meet
and
muster
the
very
horses
seemed
to
trample
with
less
sound
than
usual
on
the
bruised
and
broken
turf
as
if
they
too
were
conscious
that
there
was
need
of
caution
for
the
last
time
before
i
mounted
i
returned
to
my
quarters
i
steeped
my
burning
brow
in
the
pure
element
i
threw
aside
my
doublet
and
bathed
my
strong
arms
for
i
felt
that
contrary
to
my
wont
my
nerves
were
shaken
and
i
was
resolved
that
nothing
should
be
left
to
chance
which
might
be
secured
by
care
i
renewed
the
flints
in
the
newly
invented
locks
of
my
best
pistols
i
passed
my
poniard
ay
and
my
rapier
once
and
again
across
the
hissing
whetstone
i
bound
a
strong
spiked
collar
on
the
neck
of
the
stanch
bloodhound
and
in
the
ardour
of
my
feelings
i
apostrophized
the
noble
brute
i
conversed
with
him
as
though
he
were
a
rational
and
thoughtful
being
i
told
him
that
he
should
follow
me
to
the
field
that
he
should
fight
in
the
strife
of
men
for
his
master
s
bride
and
by
the
heaven
that
is
above
me
i
believe
he
marked
and
understood
my
words
his
full
bright
eye
read
my
features
as
i
spoke
and
as
i
ended
he
feathered
his
long
stern
stooped
his
nose
to
the
ground
as
though
he
were
tracking
the
uttered
a
deep
full
mouthed
bay

and
louder
than
i
had
heard
him
give
when
hard
upon
the
haunches
of
the
wounded

i
cried
forward
old

but
silence
and
not
again
though
he
led
our
advance
running
straight
and
hard
towards
the
nunnery
did
he
so
much
as
whine
throughout
that
night
i
despatched
an
officer
to
d
harcourt
as
i
left
the
camp
requesting
him
to
allow
me
a
full
hour
s
space
wherein
to
reach
my
ground
and
then
with
all
the
noise
and
demonstration
possible
to
charge
in
column
on
the
centre
of
lorraine
i
waited
not
his
reply
for
his
own
fame
and
honour
i
doubted
not
he
would
advance
and
my

admitted

in
an
hour
s
rapid
but
silent
marching
we
gained
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
the
moon
was
setting
but
her
light
faint
and
uncertain
as
she
waded
through
the
fleeting
clouds
came
and
went
in
fitful
gleams
over
the
dense
woodlands
and
the
grassy
glades
there
was
no
sound
or
stir
all
seemed
peaceful
and
at
rest
it
was
my
object
fully
to
occupy
the
woods
in
the
rear
of
the
nunnery
before
giving
any
alarm
in
order
to
cut
off
the
possibility
of
flight
to
or
succour
from
the
army
of
lorraine
this
done
i
had
resolved
to
invest
the
building
on
every
side
and
to
obtain
admission
peaceably
if
possible
but
if
not
by
any
means
with
this
view
i
extensively
cultivated
as
now
when
to
the

the
south
and

lofty
blue
outline
of

catskills
on
the
west
the
eye
ranges
over
a
rich
and
enjoyed
country
beside
the
accidental
charm
of
a
pretty
landscape
the
inn
had
advantages
peculiar
to
itself
instead
of
being
placed
on
the
roadside
as
most
of
our
taverns
are
for
what
reason
we
know
not
unless
a
cloud
of
travellers

be
typical
of
a
shower

inn

separated
from
the
highway
by
a
court
yard
shaded
by
two
wide
spreading
elms
and
enlivened
with
a
profusion
of
autumnal
flowers
marigolds
cockscombs
and
china
asters
there
was
nothing
that
indicated
any
claims
to
particular
civility
in
the
appearance
of
our
travellers
they
were
well
looking
and
respectably
to
remain
for
the
night
they
were
shown
to
an
inner
room
the
parlour
par
excellence
where
mrs
reynolds
appeared
and
having
opened
a
door
which
admitted
the
balmy
air
and
a
view
of
the
western
sky
just
then
brightened
by
the
tints
of
the
setting
sun
she
received
their
orders
for
their
supper
and
retired
without
one
of
those
remarks
or
inquiries
by
which
it
is
usual
on
such
occasions
to
give
vent
to
curiosity
nothing
passed
between
our
travellers
in
the
dull
interval
that
elapsed
before
their
meal
was
ready
to
give
to
our
readers
the
least
clue
to
their
origin
or
destiny
one
of
them
lulled
himself
into
a
doze
in
the
rocking
chair
while
the
other
younger
and
more
active
and
vivacious
amused
himself
out
of
doors
plucking
flowers
enraging
an
old
petulant
cock
turkey
and
mocking
the
scolding
of
some
guinea
hens
the
xantippes
of
the
feathered
race
the
interval
was
not
long
the
door
opened
and
the
tea
table
was
brought
in
from
our
pattern
landlady
and
spread
in
a
manner
to
characterize
our
bountiful
country
what
a
contrast
does
the
evening
meal
of
our
humblest
inn
present
to
the
leanness
of
an
english
tea
table
a
cornucopia
would
have
been
the
appropriate
symbol
for
mrs
reynolds

table
there
were
beef
steaks
and
ham
and
eggs
hot
cakes
and
toast

and
gingerbread

the
indigenous
cakes

as

and

afterpiece

do
not
condemn
our
bill
of
fare
as
impertinent
and
vulgar
we
put
it
down
to
show
the
scared

economists
that
with
us

of

the
means
of
subsistence
presses
on
the

our
travellers
fell
to
their
repast
with
appetites
whetted
by
a
long
fast
and
a
day
s
ride
not
a
word
was
spoken
till
a
little
girl
who
was
sitting
on
the
doorstep
caressing
a
tame
pigeon
buttonhole
with
a
bunch
of
marigolds
plucked
a
rose
from
a
monthly
rose
bush
trained
over
a
trellis
at
the
door
and
laid
it
beside
his
plate
he
seemed
struck
with
the
modest
offering
and
turning
with
a
look
of
gratitude
to
the
child
he
patted
her
on
her
head
and
exclaimed
instinctively
merci
merci
ma
petite
and
then
correcting
himself
he
said
in
very
imperfect
english
i
thank
you
my
little
girl
the
child
s
attention
was
fixed
by
the
first
word
he
uttered
and
as
he
addressed
his
companion
in
french
her
countenance
indicated
more
emotion
than
would
naturally
have
been
excited
by
the
simple
circumstance
of
hearing
for
the
first
time
a
foreign
language
qu
elle
est
belle
cette
petite
he
continued
turning
to
his
companion
c
est
la
beaute
de
mon
pays
voila
brunette
et
les
yeux
si
grands
si
noirs
et
la
tournure
aussi
quelle
grce
quelle
fran
oise
as
he
proceeded
the
child
advanced
nearer
to
him
she
shook
back
the
rich
dark
curls
that
shaded
her
face
bent
her
head
forward
half
parted
her
bright
lips
and
listened
with
the
uncertain
and
eager
expression
of
one
who
is
catching
a
half
remembered
tune
the
key
to
a
thousand
awakening
recollections
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
comprehend
the
purport
of
the
words
and
that
it
was
the
sound
alone
to
which
her
delighted
ear
was
stretched
a
smile
played
about
her
lips
and
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
contrariety
of
emotions
confounding
even
to
herself
but
that
which
finally
prevailed
was
indicated
by
her
throwing
her
apron
over
her
head
and
retreating
to
the
doorstep
where
she
sat
down
and
for
some
moments
vainly
attempted
to
stifle
her
sobs
she
had
just
become
tranquil
when
mrs
reynolds
entered
the
elder
traveller
said
in
an
interrogating
tone
that
is
your
child
ma
am
not
very
satisfactory
reply
she
resembles
neither
you
nor
your
husband
resumed
the
traveller
no
she
does
not
favour
us
i
fancied
she
had
a
french
look
i
ca
nt
say
as
to
that
replied
the
landlady
i
never
saw
any
french
people
my
friend
here
is
a
frenchman
pursued
the
traveller
and
the
little
girl
listened
to
him
so
intently
that
i
thought
it
possible
she
might
understand
him
no
i
guess
she
did
not
sense
him
replied
mrs
reynolds
with
an
air
of
indifference
and
then
turning
hastily
to
the
child
mary
she
said
there
is
more
company
go
and
see
if
your
father
does
not
want
you
she
went
and
did
not
return
mrs
reynolds
herself
removed
the
table
the
elder
gentleman
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
while
the
frenchman
walked
to
and
fro
opened
the
doors
and
peeped
in
who
seemed
to
have
taken
complete
possession
of
his
imagination
once
as
she
ran
through
the
passage
he
called
to
her
doucement
doucement
mon
petit
ange
she
stopped
as
if
she
were
glued
to
the
floor
how
call
you
your
name
my
dear
mary
reynolds
sir
then
madame
there
mistress
reynolds
is
your
maman
she
is
mary
what
are
you
staying
for
here
this
instant
screamed
mrs
reynolds
from
the
fight
one
or
two
offered
resistance
boldly
and
with
as
much
skill
as
resolution
but
they
were
soon
overpowered
as
they
received
no
support
from
their
comrades
who
were
now
scampering
in
the
bushes
in
every
direction
the
surprise
had
been
complete
not
a
man
was
seriously
hurt
among
the
whigs
while
every
rifle
fired
in
the
first
of
the
fray
slain
outright
a
few
more
sabred
and
some
few
were
made
prisoners
the
rest
took
the
back
track
into
the
woods
and
though
pursued
contrived
with
few
exceptions
to
make
their
escape
the
boy
meanwhile
had
well
performed
the
other
duty
which
had
been
given
to
his
charge
the
conflict
pellmell
had
scarcely
begun
when
slipping
noiselessly
round
to
the
hollow
where
the
prisoners
were
confined
so
as
not
to
arouse
the
notice
of
the
two
sentinels
having
them
in
custody
and
whose
eyes
were
now
turned
in
surprise
upon
the
unlooked
for
contest
he
cut
the
cords
which
bound
them
and
prompt
as
himself
they
were
no
sooner
free
than
they
seized
upon
their
guards
and
disarmed
them
the
ropes
were
transferred
to
other
hands
than
their
own
this
was
all
the
work
of
an
instant
so
indeed
was
the
affray
itself
and
the
first
object
that
met
the
eyes
of
singleton
as
he
returned
from
the
charge
to
the
spot
where
it
over
the
man
he
had
shot
and
curiously
inspecting
the
bullet
hole
which
he
had
made
through
and
through
his
forehead
ha
boy
said
singleton
you
have
done
well
you
have
behaved
like
a
man
oh
sir
tell
me
cried
the
boy
was
this
the
man
that
was
swearing
so
but
a
minute
ago
and
can
this
be
the
bullet
hole
from
my
rifle
it
is
this
is
the
wretch
and
your
bullet
was
in
the
right
time
oh
sir
he
was
cursing
when
i
fired
and
then
the
poor
man
he
was
going
to
hang
i
was
so
afraid
that
you
would
not
say
now
soon
enough
to
save
him
but
i
feel
so
strange
how
boy
i
have
killed
a
man
what
would
my
poor
mother
say
if
she
was
alive
and
knew
it
go
go
boy
you
good
cause
and
have
saved
innocent
life
besides
you
could
not
have
done
better
but
do
nt
think
of
it
i
ca
nt
help
thinking
of
it
sir
said
the
boy
upon
whom
a
new
experience
was
dawning
rapidly
as
he
moved
back
to
the
copse
where
he
had
been
concealed
to
resume
his
jacket
and
rifle
which
he
had
there
thrown
aside
in
another
quarter
of
the
field
the
scene
which
met
the
eye
of
singleton
was
one
of
those
which
amply
compensate
for
the
pain
and
the
peril
the
dread
and
the
anxiety
through
which
men
must
pass
to
witness
them
the
sudden
emancipation
of
the
prisoners
to
life
and
freedom
the
erect
aspect
of
the
beaten
and
bound
man
the
body
realizing
in
the
moment
of
its
rescue
the
liberty
for
which
the
mind
had
been
yearning
and
whose
value
can
only
be
duly
estimated
by
its
privation
a
cry
a
cheer
of
joy
was
upon
every
lip
as
the
bird
his
new
condition
of
freedom
in
song
not
less
than
flight
conspicuous
among
the
prisoners
in
their
joy
upon
this
occasion
was
the
family
of
the
brave
but
suffering
wretch
who
had
so
narrowly
escaped
the
halter
revived
by
the
noise
the
rush
the
firing
and
confusion
of
the
fight
as
much
as
by
the
earnest
cares
of
her
daughter
his
wife
had
been
filled
with
a
new
anxiety
along
with
the
new
hope
when
she
found
that
though
execution
had
not
been
done
upon
her
husband
as
so
nearly
promised
her
eyes
could
not
trace
out
his
person
in
the
midst
of
the
fierce
mele
which
followed
the
first
arrest
of
his
doom
a
moment
after
and
her
arms
were
about
his
neck
and
though
unused
to
the
melting
mood
the
tears
forced
themselves
into
the
eyes
of
singleton
as
he
surveyed
their
meeting
the
sweetness
of
their
sorrow
the
joy
which
is
tearful
the
pleasure
which
almost
grows
into
pain
in
the
depth
of
walter
griffin
and
there
is
no
more
danger
my
husband
none
none
we
are
safe
we
are
all
safe
ellen
and
where
is
gaskens
the
wretch
is
on
his
back
god
bless
the
bullet
that
came
in
time
and
the
true
hand
that
sent
it
and
we
are
free
my
father
to
go
home
again
to
our
own
home
said
the
daughter
as
she
took
the
hand
of
her
father
in
both
of
her
own
home
where
is
it
he
exclaimed
fiercely
and
with
the
same
savage
expression
with
which
his
eyes
had
regarded
gaskens
even
in
the
moment
of
his
greatest
danger
where
is
it
did
you
not
see
the
blaze
through
the
trees
as
we
looked
back
did
he
not
throw
the
torch
into
the
loft
with
his
own
accursed
hands
and
yet
you
ask
for
our
home
we
have
no
home
girl
but
we
you
will
go
to
work
we
will
soon
have
another
in
the
old
place
and
we
can
lodge
in
a
shed
till
then
never
never
i
do
no
such
folly
what
to
be
burnt
down
again
by
other
tories
no
no
i
am
chopped
already
i
can
not
be
chopped
much
worse
and
live
and
if
i
must
suffer
let
me
suffer
with
those
who
will
help
me
to
strike
too
and
to
revenge
i
will
burn
too
i
will
kill
too
i
will
have
blood
for
what
i
have
lost
and
the
sufferings
of
others
shall
pay
me
for
my
own
and
yours
singleton
approached
at
this
moment
and
the
prisoners
so
lately
freed
gathered
around
him
each
had
his
own
story
of
affliction
to
tell
and
each
more
mournful
than
the
other
they
chased
me
it
mought
be
a
matter
of
three
miles
fore
i
gin
up
captain
and
they
wore
out
run
see
to
the
previous
evening
led
her
to
believe
that
she
was
not
altogether
friendless
bradshaw
and
job
had
scarcely
proceeded
ten
steps
when
job
observed
master
though
he
boasted
himself
in
his
own
family
mr
bradshaw
i
wish
you
would
go
on
and
speak
to
my
wife
and
lucy
about
this
poor
girl
women
have
their
rights
you
know
mr
bradshaw
you
can
explain
all
of
it
to
put
their
minds
to
rest
as
to
what
she
is
and
i
ll
go
and
bring
her
along
she
has
a
mighty
pleading
look
and
then
she
s
monstrous
pretty
well
thought
bradshaw
this
is
speedier
done
than
i
thought
it
would
be
no
bail
allowed
on
a
charge
of
murder
i
do
nt
believe
she
has
committed
i
ll
come
across
him
like
a
flash
of
lightning
some
of
these
days
the
scoundrel
better
get
the
girl
in
job
s
family
if
i
can
than
have
to
manage
with
bailley
the
magistrate
or
have
a
sitting
of
the
judges
on
a
question
of
bail
besides
what
bail
could
she
get
there
s
no
bail
in
murder
if
i
could
manage
it
i
would
have
to
be
bail
myself
could
nt
be
i
ve
not
the
property
besides
if
the
girl
is
kept
here
and
where
job
s
family
can
occasionally
see
her
it
will
have
a
good
effect
upon
her
i
must
manage
to
see
glassman
there
s
one
thing
certain
there
ll
be
all
sorts
of
tales
flying
all
over
town
about
me
well
let
them
fly
the
girl
is
most
beautiful
the
mental
agony
that
she
has
suffered
there
is
a
sin
registered
against
her
betrayer
deep
as
the
mark
upon
the
brow
of
cain
can
passing
like
lighting
through
his
mind
much
more
rapidly
than
we
have
recounted
them
bradshaw
entered
the
apartments
of
job
s
family
miss
lucy
my
jaileress
of
hearts
how
do
you
do
to
day
where
is
your
mother
and
how
is
she
o
mr
bradshaw
is
that
you
sir
walk
in
exclaimed
lucy
ceasing
her
occupation
of
rocking
the
cradle
in
which
she
appeared
mechanically
engaged
with
her
knitting
untouched
in
her
lap
mother
s
well
she
s
gone
up
stairs
a
minute
lucy
what
were
you
thinking
about
so
earnestly
about
a
poor
girl
sir
who
was
brought
in
to
day
accused
of
murder
my
heavens
o
she
is
so
beautiful
sir
and
so
sorrowful
i
do
nt
believe
she
is
any
more
guilty
than
that
sleeping
baby
i
never
felt
so
bad
before
for
any
body
daddy
did
nt
want
to
put
her
among
the
it
was
best
the
poor
thing
sir
said
she
knew
you
and
lucy
gazed
earnestly
at
bradshaw
the
wife
of
the
jailer
at
this
moment
entered
the
room
good
morning
mr
bradshaw
said
she
i
thought
i
knew
your
voice
lucy
was
telling
you
about
the
girl
this
morning
she
said
she
knew
you
a
look
keener
than
lucy
s
accompanied
this
remark
of
the
worthy
mrs
presley
she
s
very
pretty
and
indeed
i
am
sorry
for
her
here
bradshaw
recounted
to
the
jailer
s
wife
and
daughter
in
his
eloquent
and
powerful
manner
the
whole
scene
of
the
night
and
also
the
situation
of
jane
durham
in
the
jail
he
told
mrs
presley
that
her
husband
wanted
to
put
her
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
their
establishment
here
the
jailer
s
wife
bridled
but
continued
bradshaw
your
husband
and
myself
thought
i
had
better
tell
how
you
felt
on
the
subject
yes
observed
mrs
presley
with
a
smile
i
thought
she
was
wronged
when
i
first
saw
her
so
your
husband
told
me
madam
remarked
bradshaw
he
said
that
you
saw
instantly
she
was
a
different
being
from
those
he
locked
up
he
observed
that
women
understood
women
much
better
than
men
you
may
well
say
that
mr
bradshaw
let
me
see
there
is
the
room
just
beside
us
that
opens
into
this
we
can
lock
the
door
that
opens
into
the
yard
and
she
can
have
that
there
s
a
bed
and
chairs
in
it
not
so
good
as
she
has
been
used
to
may
be
but
people
ca
nt
always
choose
she
can
stay
there
a
spell
and
if
we
like
her
and
there
is
no
objection
made
she
can
put
what
furniture
in
it
she
wants
if
she
turns
out
what
we
think
her
after
presley
received
consciously
and
lucy
blushingly
bradshaw
left
them
to
find
job
and
jane
durham
as
bradshaw
approached
the
jailer
s
room
he
heard
old
job
in
a
high
key
speaking
to
some
one
who
by
the
voice
he
recognised
instantly
to
be
the
lawyer
who
refused
to
pay
nancy
her
fee
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mr
scrags
said
job
the
thing
ca
nt
be
done
sir
the
man
is
in
for
counterfeiting
mr
scrags
and
he
s
been
in
before
for
robbery
he
s
a
great
jail
bird
and
it
s
against
human
natur
standing
as
i
do
jailer
of
this
establishment
to
take
the
irons
off
of
that
man
much
less
to
give
him
the
freedom
of
the
passage
without
his
irons
and
no
report
from
the
doctor
that
he
s
sick
and
no
word
i
ll
get
you
word
from
the
sheriff
and
be
d
d
to
your
human
angrily
well
mr
scrags
replied
the
jailer
you
may
damn
human
natur
just
as
much
as
you
choose
it
s
all
one
to
me
though
a
man
may
just
say
that
if
human
natur
s
damned
the
whole
lot
of
us
is
gone
that
s
all
but
mr
scrags
when
the
order
from
the
sheriff
comes
the
order
is
to
be
thought
on
by
an
act
of
the
session
of
the
general
assembly
before
last
i
believe
it
s
in
the
eighth
volume
of
the
statutes
i
know
it
s
in
the
pamphlet
of
rules
for
the
government
of
the
jail
it
is
enacted
and
provided
that
there
shall
be
trustees
appinted
to
very
lamps
which
hang
from
the
walls
are
composed
of
bones
and
the
same
material
distributed
most
fantastically
furnishes
meet
accompanying
ornaments
perhaps
this
kind
of
burial
if
such
it
may
be
called
is
one
of
the
rarest
when
an
interment
takes
place
must
be
impressive
in
the
extreme
though
with
the
broad
light
of
day
shining
through
the
windows
the
scene
seemed
more
hideous
than
morally
striking
nor
can
one
easily
feel
that
the
intended
honour
is
conferred
upon
the
unbroken
skeletons
by
permitting
them
to
stand
holding
a
card
upon
which
is
inscribed
the
name
and
age
of
the
deceased
like
guardians
of
the
mournful
piles
around
them
in
which
are
merged
the
remains
of
their
less
distinguished
brethren
the
vatican
we
crossed
the
tiber
in
a
broad
barge
and
during
the
few
moments
which
intervened
ere
our
walk
re
commenced
we
were
naturally
led
to
contrast
the
turbid
waters
and
the
dim
earth
around
us
with
the
same
scene
in
its
transcendent
aspect
as
existing
in
the
familiar
picture
of
our
fancy
the
one
was
the
plain
appearance
of
neglected
and
perhaps
degenerate
nature
the
other
impressions
derived
from
nature
s
glowing
commentator
the
poet
passing
by
a
retired
path
through
the
fields
we
soon
came
in
st
angelo
now
chiefly
used
as
a
prison
but
originally
the
tomb
of
hadrian
and
certainly
when
its
solid
proportions
were
decked
with
the
numerous
statuary
ornaments
which
once
adorned
them
it
must
have
formed
a
glorious
final
resting
place
for
a
roman
there
is
a
striking
and
melancholy
inconsistency
observable
in
this
as
in
many
instances
in
the
modern
appropriation
of
ancient
monuments
so
much
more
honourable
is
it
to
the
general
or
at
least
to
the
better
sentiment
of
mankind
to
leave
unmarred
the
few
remnants
of
a
nation
s
greatness
when
not
one
of
her
children
exists
there
is
surely
a
kind
of
sacrilege
in
disturbing
works
consecrated
to
the
dead
for
purposes
of
selfish
pride
or
narrow
utility
the
beauty
the
interest
the
blessed
inspiration
which
so
often
hallow
these
ruins
are
thus
invaded
while
no
commensurate
advantage
is
obtained
have
not
as
many
smiles
of
ridicule
or
sneers
of
reproach
as
pious
feelings
been
awakened
by
the
view
of
the
apostle
s
figures
who
can
behold
without
regret
the
mausoleum
of
the
mighty
dead
transformed
into
a
tomb
for
the
most
wretched
of
the
living
we
ascended
a
long
flight
of
steps
entered
a
square
and
corridor
and
were
soon
in
the
museum
of
the
vatican
it
were
vain
to
endeavour
to
describe
what
an
impression
of
the
richness
of
art
is
inspired
by
the
first
general
inspection
of
this
vast
collection
of
her
redeemed
trophies
and
far
more
to
paint
the
vivid
and
elevating
conception
of
her
power
which
dawns
brightens
and
finally
glows
in
the
bosom
as
face
after
face
of
thrilling
interest
figure
after
figure
of
embodied
nature
and
gem
after
gem
of
exquisite
material
or
workmanship
attracts
the
admiring
eye
all
unanimated
by
one
spiritual
principal
and
yet
so
legitimately
the
offspring
of
the
highest
and
so
perfectly
significant
as
to
awaken
wonder
enkindle
delight
and
finally
win
love
we
devoted
a
season
to
the
inspection
and
admiration
of
the
time
worn
frescos
which
exist
upon
the
walls
of
the
camere
a
splendid
battle
piece
but
of
all
the
figures
none
struck
me
as
grander
than
the
group
representing
the
miraculous
defeat
of
the
ravager
of
the
temple
struck
down
by
a
cavalier
and
two
angels
at
the
prayer
of
the
priest
most
of
the
countenances
here
depicted
are
separate
and
noble
studies
all
the
frescos
were
partially
designed
and
executed
by
raphael
they
present
a
worthy
but
melancholy
monument
to
his
genius
impaired
as
they
are
by
age
and
marred
by
his
untimely
death
yet
artists
of
the
present
day
are
continually
studying
these
dim
though
most
admirable
remains
and
find
in
their
contemplation
the
happiest
aids
and
incitements
notwithstanding
this
speaking
testimony
to
departed
excellence
as
well
as
that
which
beamed
in
the
admiring
looks
of
the
gazers
around
there
was
something
of
sadness
in
the
very
air
of
rooms
that
bore
the
name
and
shone
with
the
embodied
talent
of
the
beloved
and
early
dead
which
forced
itself
irresistibly
upon
the
mind
and
tinged
with
mournfulness
the
gratified
thoughts
but
the
presence
of
that
being
if
aught
destitute
of
sensation
deserve
the
name
it
is
when
the
eye
first
rests
and
the
heart
first
fastens
with
instinctive
eagerness
upon
the
apollo
belvidere
that
we
feel
the
triumph
of
human
art
and
there
springs
up
a
rich
sentiment
of
satisfaction
not
only
that
the
poetical
in
native
feeling
the
pure
in
taste
and
the
exalted
in
thought
are
conscious
of
unwonted
gratification
but
because
we
rejoice
in
the
spiritual
nobility
of
our
common
nature
we
glory
in
the
thought
that
the
senseless
marble
radiates
the
beautiful
and
deep
expressiveness
of
intellectual
life
at
the
call
of
human
genius
and
we
are
soothed
by
the
testimony
thus
afforded
to
the
immortality
of
what
we
most
love
in
ourselves
and
kind
for
we
feel
that
such
followers
of
nature
are
allied
to
its
author
and
may
humbly
but
legitimately
aspire
to
yet
higher
teachings
than
are
evolved
from
the
physical
universe
gardens
of
sallust
i
entered
on
a
fine
clear
day
the
large
enclosed
tract
called
beautiful
historian
s
villa
and
grounds
there
are
a
few
ill
defined
ruins
here
situated
supposed
to
be
those
of
a
temple
dedicated
to
venus
erycina
and
of
the
mansion
or
its
adjuncts
the
general
aspect
presented
during
my
wanderings
through
this
extensive
enclosure
was
more
in
accordance
with
the
idea
previously
formed
of
the
country
than
any
before
obtained
the
fertility
of
the
grounds
green
with
varied
shrubbery
and
occasionally
beautified
with
field
flowers
and
thickly
planted
with
vegetables
among
which
groups
of
labourers
were
actively
engaged
afforded
remarkable
evidence
of
the
actual
mildness
of
the
climate
while
occasional
glimpses
of
an
old
aqueduct
out
of
ten
originate
over
the
bottle
it
s
only
your
quarrelsome
fellows
by
nature
mr
cooke
or
say
an
uncivil
thing
not
you
neither
do
i
if
the
disposition
to
quarrel
or
any
ill
will
towards
a
companion
is
in
the
bosom
wine
brings
it
out
allen
continued
the
speaker
who
was
hilson
allen
you
know
all
these
matters
and
things
allen
is
a
philosopher
mr
cooke
and
his
opinion
is
oracular
allen
what
has
caused
the
greatest
number
of
quarrels
and
duels
within
your
experience
politics
was
the
reply
party
politics
so
i
thought
your
politician
is
a
fellow
with
the
hearburn
your
water
drinking
politician
your
lily
livered
cold
blooded
office
seeking
place
hunting
mischief
making
tale
bearing
under
mining
politician
colonel
did
you
ever
know
a
man
with
a
ruby
coloured
nose
and
a
carmine
cheek
that
ever
fought
a
duel
it
will
be
readily
imagined
that
this
question
was
intended
by
the
way
to
bring
on
the
reply
and
discussion
that
followed
yes
many
a
and
alcort
were
neither
of
them
chalk
faced
there
was
johnson
too
who
was
shot
by
brown
had
a
face
as
full
of
claret
as
your
own
though
it
showed
through
a
browner
covering
of
skin
colonel
you
know
the
particulars
of
that
affair
said
allen
inquiringly
as
he
puffed
a
volume
of
smoke
towards
the
man
of
war
yes
but
they
are
not
to
be
told
it
was
a
bloody
business
our
hero
inquired
if
either
fell
and
looks
of
intelligence
passed
from
one
to
the
other
among
the
young
men
who
were
in
the
plot
spiffard
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
colonel
who
answered
with
a
tremendous
oath
both
ought
to
have
been
killed
ten
times
over
if
either
could
have
hit
the
broad
side
of
a
church
at
ten
paces
to
be
sure
it
was
rather
late
in
the
evening
but
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
and
that
gave
light
and
made
a
mark
surer
i
remember
in
the
year
it
was
when
we
were
hutted
near
morristown
no
colonel
not
that
story
but
the
duel
of
brown
and
johnson
that
was
just
over
the
fence
to
the
north
of
love
lane
love
lane
called
so
said
cooke
because
no
love
is
ever
lost
there
does
hoboken
mean
love
in
dutch
i
suppose
said
allen
that
brown
never
fired
a
pistol
before
in
his
life
and
let
me
tell
you
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
keep
a
muzzle
in
line
no
nor
would
he
then
said
the
gruff
man
of
war
if
he
had
not
been
told
that
his
standing
with
the
party
and
in
society
depended
upon
his
fighting
so
the
yankees
commit
murder
for
fear
of
losing
their
reputation
as
good
members
of
society
yes
said
spiffard
it
is
fear
that
makes
men
brave
death
in
many
cases
the
one
associates
makes
many
a
man
expose
himself
to
his
adversary
s
ball
or
risk
the
shedding
his
brother
s
blood
no
man
said
allen
taking
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
breaking
off
the
ashes
which
had
accumulated
on
the
end
like
the
snuff
of
a
burning
candle
no
man
and
he
deliberately
placed
the
brightened
cigar
on
the
table
the
fire
end
a
little
over
the
edge
no
man
and
he
spoke
with
emphasis
assuming
a
most
oracular
air
can
refuse
to
fight
when
challenged
if
he
had
provoked
the
challenge
spiffard
looked
at
the
oracle
with
lack
lustre
eye
the
upper
lid
hanging
remarkably
low
his
chin
elongated
and
his
mouth
a
little
opened
he
was
taken
in
the
snare
he
had
no
greater
dread
of
death
than
is
common
to
humanity
and
he
thought
himself
principled
against
duelling
yet
he
began
to
have
a
glimpse
in
imagination
of
a
duel
impending
and
himself
one
of
the
parties
smile
were
dancing
in
mournful
measure
in
his
mind
when
the
speaker
continued
if
a
gentleman
makes
use
of
offensive
language
to
another
gentleman
and
is
called
upon
for
an
apology
he
must
make
it
or
accept
the
offended
party
s
challenge
if
he
thinks
fit
to
call
him
out
allen
resumed
his
cigar
spiffard
look
d
ruminating
he
was
chewing
the
cud
without
that
satisfaction
which
attends
it
in
some
of
his
fellow
water
drinkers
the
colonel
responded
to
the
oracle
s
exposition
of
the
law
of
the
duello
with
certainly
and
an
immense
volume
of
tobacco
smoke
no
doubt
said
another
the
conspirators
watched
the
countenance
of
spiffard
and
saw
the
success
of
their
hoax
johnson
said
allen
insulted
brown
brutally
and
deserved
to
be
shot
the
colonel
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
speaking
after
puffing
off
a
cloud
of
smoke
observed
i
believe
it
is
always
the
case
that
the
repeated
spiffard
but
colonel
do
you
mean
the
offence
that
called
forth
the
demand
for
an
apology
or
the
offence
first
given
let
me
understand
your
question
state
a
case
why
as
thus
if
a
man
reproves
another
for
improper
behaviour
to
a
female
for
example
and
the
person
reproved
demands
an
apology
it
can
not
be
given
said
the
colonel
it
can
not
be
given
said
allen
certainly
not
said
hilson
if
continued
our
hero
on
refusal
of
apology
a
challenge
ensues
he
must
fight
said
the
colonel
yes
said
hilson
he
must
fight
certainly
he
must
fight
said
allen
as
long
as
the
challenger
chooses
to
shoot
at
him
said
hilson
i
knew
a
case
in
point
said
the
colonel
but
the
parties
fought
with
us
at
yorktown
but
colonel
queried
the
vermonter
according
to
your
theory
i
should
suppose
that
the
person
giving
the
offence
would
in
this
case
be
the
man
whose
behaviour
had
been
improper
towards
the
female
he
would
be
the
offender
and
not
the
person
who
reproved
him
the
reprover
being
right
can
not
possibly
apologize
said
allen
it
is
pity
that
one
can
not
be
sure
where
the
ball
would
strike
for
notwithstanding
the
colonel
s
theory
who
knows
against
the
rendezvous
of
the
pirates
the
fair
girl
whose
star
of
happiness
seemed
now
in
the
ascendant
and
about
to
shine
propitiously
upon
her
future
life
re
assumed
her
reclining
attitude
by
the
cabin
window
which
overlooked
the
sea
in
the
direction
of
her
native
land
for
a
few
moments
her
thoughts
were
engaged
upon
her
approaching
bridal
but
gradually
they
assumed
the
garb
of
memory
and
winging
like
a
wearied
bird
over
the
evening
sea
reposed
in
the
home
of
her
childhood
as
she
still
gazed
vacantly
upon
the
fading
horizon
she
was
conscious
that
a
dark
object
broke
its
even
line
it
grew
called
from
her
half
conscious
abstraction
by
a
change
in
its
appearance
when
fixing
her
look
more
keenly
in
the
direction
she
saw
it
was
a
schooner
just
rounding
to
about
a
mile
beyond
the
frigate
apparently
it
had
not
as
yet
been
observed
from
the
deck
as
all
eyes
were
turned
to
the
shore
following
the
boats
which
had
just
gained
the
foot
of
the
cliff
at
the
sight
of
the
vessel
so
nearly
resembling
the
one
whose
prisoner
she
had
been
her
capture
and
its
trying
scenes
came
vividly
before
her
mind
and
she
turned
her
face
from
an
object
connected
with
such
disagreeable
associations
the
approaching
ceremony
again
agitated
her
bosom
and
as
her
eye
rested
upon
a
mirror
in
the
opposite
pannel
she
parted
with
care
her
dark
hair
from
her
forehead
arranged
in
more
graceful
folds
her
mantilla
and
all
the
woman
beamed
in
her
fine
eyes
as
they
met
the
reflection
of
her
lovely
countenance
and
symmetrically
moulded
figure
how
long
he
stays
he
said
unconsciously
aloud
the
virgin
protect
him
from
harm
the
count
will
soon
return
ma
moiselle
said
a
small
mulatto
boy
who
acted
as
steward
of
the
state
rooms
now
that
they
were
occupied
by
their
fair
inmate
she
turned
as
he
spoke
is
there
danger
boy
none
please
you
ma
moiselle
the
men
on
deck
say
the
rovers
have
left
their
rock
and
that
there
will
be
no
fighting
sacra
diable
he
suddenly
shrieked
pointing
to
the
state
room
window
at
which
appeared
the
head
of
the
slave
constanza
also
turned
but
only
to
be
grasped
in
his
frightful
arms
at
first
surprised
and
too
much
paralized
with
fear
to
scream
cudjoe
prevented
her
from
giving
the
alarm
by
winding
her
mantilla
about
her
mouth
and
hastily
conveyed
her
through
the
window
or
port
hole
from
which
the
gun
usually
stationed
there
had
been
removed
rapidly
letting
himself
with
his
burden
down
her
into
the
sea
and
raising
her
head
above
water
with
one
muscular
arm
a
few
vigorous
strokes
with
the
other
bore
him
within
the
black
shadow
of
the
rocks
behind
a
projecting
point
of
which
he
disappeared
re
entering
the
hut
after
the
abrupt
departure
of
the
slave
oula
released
the
spaniard
from
his
place
of
concealment
and
informed
him
of
her
plan
to
place
the
lady
in
his
power
you
are
a
very
devil
for
happy
thoughts
he
said
with
animation
but
if
the
revengeful
slave
gets
her
i
may
thank
you
and
not
fetish
for
the
prize
have
her
this
night
i
must
for
i
expect
my
schooner
ha
there
is
the
juli
now
by
the
holy
twelve
he
exclaimed
as
his
quick
eye
rested
upon
the
object
which
had
attracted
the
attention
of
constanza
getzendanner
will
be
putting
a
boat
in
for
me
and
yet
he
must
see
the
frigate
unless
she
lays
too
dark
in
the
cliff
s
shadow
will
he
bring
her
to
the
hut
if
he
succeeds
think
you
oula
he
suddenly
and
sharply
inquired
as
a
suspicion
of
change
in
the
negro
s
purpose
flashed
across
his
mind
bring
de
lady
she
exclaimed
in
surprize
he
know
he
finger
rot
off
he
eye
fall
out
and
he
hair
turn
to
de
live
snake
wid
de
fang
if
he
no
bring
her
he
no
dare
keep
her
way
solaced
by
this
assurance
he
paced
the
little
green
plat
before
the
cabin
often
casting
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
frigate
nearly
half
an
hour
elapsed
after
the
departure
of
cudjoe
when
the
robes
of
the
maiden
borne
in
the
arms
of
the
slave
caught
his
eye
back
back
you
spoil
de
whole
exclaimed
oula
as
the
impatient
spaniard
darted
forward
to
seize
his
prize
instead
of
the
maiden
s
lovely
form
he
met
the
herculean
shoulders
of
the
slave
whose
long
knife
passed
directly
through
his
fell
dead
at
his
feet
resigning
the
maiden
to
the
faithful
juana
who
followed
immediately
behind
cudjoe
sprung
forward
with
a
cry
of
vindictive
rage
and
before
oula
could
comprehend
his
motives
the
reeking
blade
passed
through
her
withered
bosom
take
dis
hag
ob
hell
he
shouted
as
he
drew
forth
the
knife
from
her
breast
you
make
no
more
fool
ob
cudjoe
for
de
curs
spaniard
grande
diable
what
debble
dis
he
suddenly
yelled
and
groaned
as
the
son
of
the
slain
obeah
leaped
upon
his
neck
when
he
saw
his
mother
fall
and
grappled
his
throat
tightly
with
his
fingers
while
he
fixed
his
teeth
deep
into
his
flesh
the
struggle
between
them
was
but
for
a
moment
finding
it
impossible
to
disengage
his
fingers
the
slave
bent
his
arm
backward
and
passed
his
long
knife
up
through
his
body
the
thrust
was
a
skilful
one
and
fatal
to
the
boy
who
released
his
grasp
and
fell
the
meanwhile
juana
had
borne
constanza
to
the
fire
in
the
hut
and
was
using
every
means
to
restore
circulation
to
the
chilled
limbs
of
the
unconscious
girl
the
interview
between
the
spaniard
and
oula
had
been
overheard
by
juana
from
the
rock
above
the
hut
after
the
escape
of
her
mistress
and
the
count
and
the
departure
of
lafitte
and
his
men
in
pursuit
with
the
exception
of
cudjoe
who
in
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
getting
underweigh
was
left
behind
and
with
whom
she
was
accustomed
to
dissipation
of
any
sort
the
thought
of
you
would
have
been
a
shield
to
me
knowing
you
and
charlotte
so
well
and
the
memory
of
my
excellent
mother
have
given
me
a
reverence
for
female
virtue
a
belief
in
the
power
and
beauty
of
goodness
in
a
woman
and
to
this
susan
love
naturally
follows
that
pure
love
that
is
ordained
by
god
to
lead
to
the
holy
institution
of
marriage
but
what
are
my
thoughts
running
to
go
back
to
my
business
statements
when
i
began
business
i
took
lodgings
at
a
carman
s
he
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
with
him
i
could
live
at
a
small
expense
in
a
quiet
family
i
have
avoided
living
or
associating
with
those
who
had
more
means
than
i
for
that
leads
to
expense
i
have
never
spent
a
shilling
on
superfluities
for
which
i
have
now
much
reason
to
be
thankful
for
even
if
i
had
escaped
that
dreadful
load
unpaid
debts
i
might
like
many
other
young
men
have
acquired
habits
of
expense
on
the
credit
of
future
gains
the
gains
may
not
come
the
habits
remain
like
so
many
tormentors
when
i
was
asked
by
a
friend
to
go
to
an
oyster
house
or
the
theatre
or
the
circus
or
to
take
a
bottle
of
porter
or
drink
a
glass
of
whiskey
i
declined
i
knew
if
i
did
it
for
my
friend
s
sake
this
time
i
might
do
treats
my
pleasant
thoughts
of
the
time
when
i
should
have
a
table
of
my
own
and
faces
round
it
that
i
loved
it
is
sure
we
ca
nt
have
every
thing
in
this
world
and
the
thing
is
to
make
up
our
mind
what
we
must
have
and
what
we
can
do
without
you
can
guess
my
must
have
when
i
found
finley
and
i
were
going
behind
hand
i
determined
to
stop
short
and
not
as
many
do
put
off
the
evil
day
plunging
deeper
and
deeper
making
enemies
and
making
plenty
of
work
for
repentance
when
our
affairs
were
settled
up
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
in
my
pocket
and
no
one
to
look
me
in
the
face
and
say
i
owed
him
a
shilling
or
had
wronged
him
of
one
the
next
thing
was
to
determine
on
what
business
i
should
follow
you
know
my
breast
was
much
weakened
by
sitting
over
my
lapstone
when
i
was
growing
fast
it
is
a
bad
trade
to
put
a
a
farm
in
one
of
the
free
western
states
seemed
to
me
the
happiest
lot
in
the
world
for
a
poor
man
but
there
were
hardships
in
the
beginning
and
though
you
and
i
would
not
have
minded
them
your
father
and
lottie
could
not
have
stood
them
a
farm
at
essex
i
dared
not
think
of
a
man
must
have
some
capital
and
knowledge
practice
and
skill
to
go
ahead
in
new
england
on
a
farm
and
i
had
none
of
these
while
i
was
deliberating
my
good
friend
mr
loomis
the
carman
determined
to
move
to
ohio
he
advised
me
to
take
up
his
business
and
offered
to
sell
me
his
horse
and
cart
on
very
reasonable
terms
and
to
recommend
me
to
his
employers
there
were
many
reasons
to
decide
me
to
take
his
advice
i
find
exercise
in
the
open
air
the
best
medicine
for
the
pain
in
my
breast
carting
is
a
sure
and
regular
business
i
have
observed
that
the
carmen
in
this
city
are
a
healthy
cheerful
looking
class
of
men
they
go
slowly
but
surely
ahead
they
can
generally
manage
to
take
their
meals
with
their
families
and
to
spend
all
their
evenings
at
home
a
great
point
to
a
man
who
loves
home
faces
and
home
pleasures
as
i
do
some
persons
think
it
is
going
down
a
step
to
go
from
shop
keeping
to
carting
but
you
and
i
susan
have
our
own
notions
about
going
up
and
down
and
both
think
it
is
what
is
in
a
man
and
not
what
is
out
of
him
that
humbles
or
exalts
him
some
think
that
most
genteel
which
brings
them
nearest
to
being
idle
gentlemen
but
when
i
am
driving
through
broadway
on
my
cart
do
you
think
i
would
change
places
with
those
slim
looking
young
men
i
see
parading
up
and
down
the
street
looking
like
tailors
walking
advertisements
bringing
nothing
to
pass
doing
nothing
with
the
time
god
gives
them
in
this
world
and
gives
them
for
what
oh
i
might
have
gone
into
trade
of
some
kind
but
i
have
not
health
to
be
shut
up
behind
a
counter
and
besides
in
my
opinion
a
shop
is
a
fitting
place
for
women
only
they
being
do
nt
be
affronted
susy
the
weaker
sex
you
see
now
how
my
case
stands
i
have
no
debts
i
have
good
health
for
the
business
i
have
chosen
industry
and
a
faculty
i
may
boast
so
i
think
i
may
marry
in
this
blessed
country
of
ours
where
there
is
sure
employment
and
a
man
is
certain
of
getting
his
earnings
besides
dear
susan
if
any
thing
happens
to
me
you
have
your
trade
to
depend
upon
give
my
best
love
to
charlotte
and
tell
her
besides
being
a
main
comfort
she
will
be
a
real
help
to
us
for
while
she
is
doing
the
light
work
your
needle
will
be
making
money
if
your
father
has
any
scruples
about
coming
pray
tell
him
rent
of
a
room
here
and
save
us
from
near
neighbours
we
may
not
like
am
i
not
calculating
susan
but
is
it
not
better
to
calculate
beforehand
than
to
grumble
afterward
i
am
sure
i
am
right
so
far
as
i
can
to
secure
independence
to
your
father
and
charlotte
and
if
after
all
they
must
take
something
from
us
those
who
are
so
generous
in
giving
will
be
also
generous
in
receiving
and
they
will
not
grudge
us
the
do
i
speak
thus
repiningly
by
comparison
my
present
condition
is
one
of
bliss
and
does
not
hope
now
dawn
on
me
even
on
this
side
of
the
grave
the
hope
of
such
pleasures
as
my
heart
has
ever
yearned
after
the
pleasure
springing
from
the
approbation
of
the
good
the
conversation
of
the
wise
the
society
of
the
refined
and
polite
oh
how
my
heart
at
the
thought
of
seeing
you
again
leaps
up
and
then
falls
humbled
in
the
dust
at
the
recollections
with
which
your
name
is
associated
but
i
will
not
offend
you
by
prating
about
my
feelings
one
only
you
must
give
command
the
devoted
heartfelt
gratitude
of
will
you
permit
me
to
say
your
friend
m
s
chapter
xiv
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
that
need
no
repentance
st
luke
while
i
read
this
long
letter
balcombe
amused
himself
with
a
book
when
i
had
got
through
i
did
not
immediately
interrupt
him
for
i
was
glad
to
steal
a
moment
for
my
own
thoughts
at
length
i
remarked
that
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
the
present
posture
of
our
affairs
rendered
hurry
unnecessary
and
that
we
might
safely
indulge
ourselves
with
a
day
or
two
of
rest
take
care
william
said
balcombe
remember
we
have
to
do
with
one
who
never
sleeps
i
know
it
is
not
sloth
that
would
keep
you
here
but
i
am
much
mistaken
if
your
absence
has
not
already
served
you
better
than
your
presence
could
have
done
you
will
lose
nothing
by
that
sure
and
i
deceive
myself
if
you
do
nt
find
influences
exerted
in
your
favour
which
have
been
heretofore
exerted
against
you
you
do
nt
mean
said
i
to
impute
mercenary
feelings
to
ann
by
no
means
i
am
not
exactly
sure
of
my
own
meaning
nor
will
i
permit
myself
to
be
so
unless
i
become
convinced
that
my
thoughts
do
no
wrong
to
others
but
we
must
betake
ourselves
to
rest
for
the
way
is
long
to
raby
hall
and
we
must
sleep
there
to
morrow
night
he
now
left
me
and
went
to
his
room
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
we
were
in
the
saddle
the
day
was
pleasant
for
the
season
but
the
roads
were
deep
and
we
got
on
but
slowly
night
overtook
us
when
we
were
yet
ten
miles
from
the
place
of
our
destination
but
balcombe
knew
the
road
and
we
had
a
new
moon
which
promised
to
give
light
until
we
should
be
within
patiently
toiled
along
over
ground
roughened
by
a
partial
thaw
which
made
it
difficult
for
our
weary
horses
to
pick
their
way
it
was
not
very
far
from
midnight
when
we
reached
the
stables
which
were
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
in
passing
these
we
met
a
negro
man
of
whom
balcombe
inquired
if
major
swann
was
at
home
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
asked
the
negro
s
name
charles
sir
was
the
reply
what
old
amy
s
son
charles
yes
sir
and
how
is
your
mother
charles
i
thank
you
sir
she
been
mighty
low
but
miss
mary
take
such
good
care
of
her
she
right
well
again
only
just
she
mighty
old
master
and
are
you
hostler
here
still
charles
yes
master
but
master
i
do
nt
know
who
you
for
all
you
seems
to
know
all
about
us
i
think
i
should
know
your
s
do
nt
you
remember
george
balcombe
the
negro
clapped
his
hands
and
springing
into
the
air
alighted
with
balcombe
s
hand
in
both
of
his
to
one
not
accustomed
to
the
negro
character
their
strong
attachments
and
grotesque
manner
of
displaying
their
feelings
the
contortions
of
his
dusky
figure
bowing
himself
on
balcombe
s
hand
then
swaying
his
body
back
and
writhing
from
side
to
side
like
a
wounded
serpent
would
have
been
amusing
oh
mass
george
said
he
i
so
glad
to
see
you
and
poor
miss
mary
she
be
so
glad
to
see
you
too
sir
and
how
is
she
charles
oh
thank
god
she
right
well
sir
and
mighty
comfortable
old
master
and
missis
here
sir
mighty
good
to
her
but
who
this
you
got
here
with
you
master
this
is
mr
napier
charles
your
old
master
negro
mass
william
my
miss
fanny
s
son
oh
bless
god
i
live
to
see
him
then
turning
to
me
he
added
in
a
plaintive
tone
master
i
been
afraid
you
never
was
coming
to
see
your
poor
negroes
now
we
do
nt
belong
to
you
no
more
but
all
gone
to
strange
man
that
lives
away
there
in
england
and
do
nt
care
nothing
at
all
about
us
i
was
mightily
in
hopes
we
d
all
have
gone
to
you
sir
but
you
s
my
master
for
all
that
as
he
spoke
this
in
a
tone
of
reverential
affection
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
he
took
it
and
drawing
it
strongly
downward
to
accommodate
it
to
the
lowliness
of
his
prostration
bowed
himself
upon
it
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
i
felt
a
tear
upon
it
and
if
an
answering
tear
had
not
sprung
to
my
eye
i
should
have
little
deserved
to
be
the
object
of
a
loyalty
as
you
are
as
tired
of
the
saddle
as
i
am
william
said
balcombe
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
leave
our
horses
with
charles
and
walk
to
the
house
i
gladly
assented
to
this
and
balcombe
addressing
the
negro
added
charles
my
good
fellow
take
care
of
our
little
baggage
and
bring
it
up
to
the
house
saying
this
he
alighted
and
we
walked
on
both
too
busy
with
our
own
thoughts
for
conversation
as
we
approached
the
house
we
saw
a
dusky
red
light
glimmer
fitfully
from
between
the
bars
of
a
cellar
window
just
as
we
were
about
to
enter
it
flashed
up
brighter
than
before
and
to
rest
on
the
same
ground
it
is
mere
fancy
it
is
a
nullity
unless
it
be
true
as
i
think
it
is
that
it
has
been
the
source
of
great
mischiefs
to
the
world
in
which
case
it
can
not
be
termed
a
nullity
but
something
positively
pernicious
what
age
of
the
world
can
be
named
when
an
insane
devotion
to
one
s
country
has
upon
evil
beyond
the
power
of
memory
to
recount
patriotism
standing
for
this
instinctive
slavery
of
the
will
has
cursed
as
much
as
it
has
blessed
mankind
men
have
not
reasoned
they
have
only
felt
they
have
not
inquired
is
the
cause
of
my
country
just
but
is
it
her
cause
that
has
ever
been
the
cry
in
rome
our
country
our
country
right
or
wrong
our
country
it
is
a
maxim
good
for
conquest
and
despotism
bad
for
peace
and
justice
it
has
made
rome
mistress
of
the
world
and
at
the
same
time
the
scourge
of
the
world
and
trodden
down
into
their
own
blood
stained
soil
the
people
of
many
a
clime
who
had
else
dwelt
in
freedom
i
am
no
roman
in
this
sense
and
ought
never
to
have
been
admit
that
i
am
not
justified
in
raising
my
hand
against
the
life
of
a
parent
though
if
i
could
defend
myself
against
violence
no
otherwise
i
should
raise
to
approve
and
second
with
my
best
blood
all
the
acts
of
my
country
but
when
she
errs
am
bound
on
the
other
hand
to
blame
and
if
need
be
oppose
why
not
what
is
this
country
men
like
myself
who
enact
the
decrees
by
which
i
am
to
be
thus
bound
senators
no
more
profoundly
wise
perhaps
and
no
more
irreproachably
virtuous
than
myself
and
do
i
owe
their
judgments
a
dearer
allegiance
and
which
i
esteem
false
than
i
do
to
my
own
which
i
esteem
right
and
true
never
such
patriotism
is
a
degradation
and
a
vice
rome
lucius
i
think
to
have
dealt
by
me
and
the
miserable
men
who
with
me
fell
into
the
hands
of
sapor
after
the
manner
of
a
selfish
cold
hearted
unnatural
parent
and
i
renounce
her
and
allegiance
to
her
i
am
from
this
hour
a
palmyrene
zenobia
is
my
mother
palmyra
my
country
but
distinction
be
made
between
your
country
and
her
emperor
is
the
country
to
rest
under
the
imputation
which
is
justly
perhaps
cast
upon
its
men
that
were
hardly
right
to
renounce
gallienus
were
he
now
emperor
were
a
defensible
act
but
why
rome
or
aurelian
i
freely
grant
that
had
a
just
emperor
been
upon
the
throne
a
man
with
human
feelings
the
people
had
he
projected
our
rescue
or
revenge
would
have
gone
with
him
but
how
is
their
conduct
to
be
defended
during
the
long
reign
of
the
son
of
valerian
was
such
a
people
as
the
people
of
rome
to
conform
their
minds
and
acts
to
a
monster
like
him
was
that
the
part
of
a
great
nation
is
it
credible
that
the
senate
and
the
people
together
had
no
power
to
compel
gallienus
to
the
performance
of
his
duties
to
his
own
father
and
the
brave
legions
who
fell
with
him
alas
they
too
wanted
the
will
oh
not
the
death
or
the
captivity
of
his
father
that
he
might
reign
to
release
him
was
the
last
act
that
wretch
could
have
been
urged
to
do
and
could
he
then
have
been
made
to
interpose
for
the
others
he
might
have
been
assassinated
but
all
the
power
of
rome
could
not
have
compelled
him
to
a
war
the
issue
of
which
might
have
been
by
the
rescue
of
valerian
to
lose
him
his
throne
then
he
should
have
been
assassinated
rome
owed
herself
a
greater
duty
than
allegiance
to
a
beast
in
human
form
but
calpurnius
you
are
now
at
liberty
why
consider
so
curiously
whence
it
comes
besides
you
have
while
in
persia
dwelt
in
comfort
and
at
last
even
in
magnificence
the
prince
himself
has
been
your
companion
and
friend
what
was
it
he
replied
what
was
it
when
i
reflected
upon
myself
but
so
much
deeper
degradation
to
find
that
in
spite
of
myself
persian
effeminacy
what
was
it
but
the
worst
wretchedness
of
all
to
feel
as
i
did
that
i
a
roman
and
a
piso
was
losing
my
nature
as
i
had
lost
my
country
if
any
thing
seemed
to
turn
my
blood
into
one
hot
current
of
bitterness
and
revenge
it
was
this
it
will
never
cool
till
i
find
myself
sword
in
hand
under
the
banners
of
zenobia
urge
me
no
more
it
were
as
hopeful
an
endeavor
to
stem
the
current
of
the
euphrates
as
to
turn
me
from
my
purpose
i
have
reasoned
with
you
because
you
are
a
brother
not
because
you
are
a
roman
and
i
i
replied
can
still
love
you
because
you
are
a
brother
nor
less
because
you
are
also
a
palmyrene
i
greet
you
as
the
head
of
our
house
the
elder
heir
of
an
illustrious
name
i
still
will
hope
that
when
these
troubles
cease
rome
may
claim
you
as
her
own
no
emperor
i
fear
would
permit
a
renegade
of
such
rank
ever
to
dwell
within
the
walls
of
rome
let
me
rather
hope
that
when
this
war
is
ended
portia
may
exchange
rome
for
palmyra
and
that
here
upon
this
fair
and
neutral
ground
the
pisos
may
once
more
dwell
beneath
the
same
roof
may
it
be
so
said
gracchus
and
let
not
the
heats
of
political
opposition
change
the
kindly
current
of
your
blood
or
inflame
it
you
lucius
piso
are
to
remember
the
provocations
of
calpurnius
and
are
to
feel
that
there
was
a
nobleness
in
that
sensibility
to
a
declension
into
persian
effeminacy
that
to
say
the
least
reflects
quite
as
much
honor
upon
the
name
of
piso
and
even
roman
as
any
loyalty
to
an
emperor
like
gallienus
or
that
infamy
are
staining
the
honour
of
his
high
name
still
the
being
i
loved
before
is
the
same
to
me
as
then
and
though
his
destiny
is
changed
and
his
path
is
now
amid
scenes
of
tumult
and
blood
still
mother
to
share
that
destiny
to
be
the
flower
on
that
path
seems
to
me
as
precious
a
lot
as
ever
ah
and
a
thousand
times
more
precious
than
when
all
else
was
bright
around
him
but
believe
me
my
daughter
did
everard
truly
love
you
or
were
his
affection
for
you
any
but
a
selfish
principle
he
would
not
ask
or
wish
you
to
make
him
happy
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
else
that
is
dear
to
you
there
dear
mother
when
everard
and
i
last
parted
t
was
in
bitterness
i
do
not
mean
the
day
my
father
forbade
him
the
dwelling
i
ve
met
him
once
since
then
though
i
did
not
tell
you
of
the
interview
because
his
name
was
a
painful
word
between
us
i
met
him
with
catharine
by
the
hemlock
spring
and
then
he
besought
me
to
go
home
with
him
to
england
and
told
me
how
happy
he
could
make
me
there
with
his
gentle
mother
and
his
fair
young
sisters
i
spoke
of
you
and
of
my
father
s
anger
heaven
knows
unkindness
was
farthest
from
me
but
his
high
spirit
had
been
deeply
wounded
and
his
feelings
had
grown
strangely
sensitive
he
construed
my
looks
and
language
into
coldness
at
his
altered
fortunes
oh
how
wrongfully
and
his
proud
spirit
grew
stern
and
with
cold
and
haughty
words
we
parted
i
ve
never
seen
him
since
that
hour
you
know
we
heard
he
hurried
to
quebec
and
then
that
there
but
from
that
hour
no
word
hath
passed
between
us
till
last
evening
last
evening
a
stranger
a
soldier
i
doubt
not
from
the
camp
above
brought
me
a
message
from
him
it
was
only
a
ring
that
i
had
given
him
for
this
and
a
few
hasty
words
written
within
the
envelope
and
what
were
they
helen
said
the
mother
calmly
for
the
young
lady
had
paused
a
moment
as
if
waiting
for
the
inquiry
the
purport
of
them
was
that
as
i
had
doubtless
bestowed
elsewhere
the
affections
i
had
withdrawn
from
him
it
were
better
that
the
token
should
go
with
them
also
but
he
prayed
that
i
would
still
deign
to
wear
the
other
as
the
memorial
of
a
heart
that
was
irrevocably
given
and
even
he
added
could
it
be
withdrawn
thus
lightly
it
were
but
an
idle
appendage
to
one
who
could
bestow
nothing
with
it
but
blighted
fortunes
his
home
too
was
henceforth
in
the
field
well
was
a
thing
too
delicate
for
such
a
soil
i
sent
him
back
the
ring
dear
mother
and
with
it
the
assurance
that
affections
strong
enough
to
endure
cold
and
wrongful
words
could
flourish
amidst
strife
and
danger
as
well
as
by
a
fireside
home
and
love
that
had
lived
through
slight
and
scorn
was
none
too
delicate
for
blighted
fortunes
and
it
would
be
because
he
himself
had
grown
weary
of
his
promises
if
helen
gray
was
not
his
bride
to
morrow
and
i
promised
mother
at
all
hazards
i
promised
to
await
him
here
this
day
so
the
blame
is
all
mine
the
sacrifice
is
voluntary
and
i
am
not
alone
in
it
dear
mother
you
know
that
even
in
that
very
camp
are
females
high
born
and
beautiful
who
have
forsaken
all
and
come
over
the
blue
waters
to
a
land
of
strangers
and
enemies
to
share
the
toils
and
dangers
of
the
camp
with
those
they
love
and
were
i
less
devoted
i
were
unworthy
a
loud
quick
voice
was
now
heard
without
and
the
next
moment
catharine
gray
rushed
eagerly
in
now
mother
do
you
know
that
the
army
are
already
beyond
the
river
and
every
wagon
is
at
this
moment
in
the
square
but
ours
helen
gray
she
continued
retreating
with
amazement
as
her
eye
just
then
fell
upon
her
sister
s
dishabille
are
you
bent
upon
our
ruin
and
your
own
are
you
utterly
distracted
sister
no
catharine
replied
mrs
gray
suddenly
rising
and
drawing
the
arm
of
her
younger
daughter
in
hers
not
distracted
catharine
but
better
far
better
that
she
were
than
thus
to
sin
against
the
reason
that
god
hath
given
her
to
him
and
to
her
own
soul
must
helen
gray
answer
for
the
hearts
that
she
hath
this
day
made
broken
and
desolate
what
is
it
what
can
it
mean
exclaimed
catharine
in
astonishment
and
vainly
seeking
to
read
the
expression
of
her
sister
ay
catharine
continued
mrs
gray
here
s
heavy
news
for
your
young
heart
your
sister
there
in
yonder
recess
your
eldest
your
kind
and
loving
sister
hath
given
you
and
me
and
all
of
us
up
forever
heavy
news
for
you
and
heavier
still
for
your
father
children
she
continued
glancing
at
the
little
faces
that
were
peeping
in
at
the
door
drawn
thither
by
the
loud
exclamations
of
catharine
your
sister
helen
is
going
away
from
us
and
you
ll
never
see
her
again
helen
said
mrs
gray
who
had
just
returned
and
she
spoke
with
an
air
so
calm
it
seemed
almost
coldness
at
that
fearful
moment
i
ve
persuaded
hannah
to
remain
here
and
accompany
you
to
the
camp
i
need
not
ask
you
to
make
her
safety
dear
to
you
as
your
own
and
now
helen
farewell
she
continued
turning
to
the
door
and
her
eye
carefully
avoiding
her
live
but
a
little
longer
in
this
unloving
world
there
will
come
an
hour
when
you
will
mourn
for
the
deep
love
you
have
this
day
flung
from
you
farewell
helen
but
then
she
paused
and
the
rushing
tears
dimed
her
sight
the
parting
words
that
tremble
on
the
lip
are
but
a
cold
unmeaning
ceremony
to
the
eye
s
farewell
that
one
last
look
hurrying
forth
city
is
near
us
in
the
palace
upon
the
palatine
but
when
he
is
here
it
is
more
remote
in
the
enchanted
gardens
of
sallust
this
spot
first
ennobled
by
and
eye
of
taste
the
chief
beauties
of
the
scene
are
to
be
traced
then
afterward
selected
by
vespasian
as
an
imperial
villa
is
now
lately
become
the
chosen
retreat
of
aurelian
it
has
indeed
lost
a
part
of
its
charms
since
it
has
been
embraced
by
the
extension
of
the
new
walls
within
the
limits
of
the
city
but
enough
remain
to
justify
abundantly
the
preference
of
a
line
of
emperors
it
is
there
that
we
see
livia
most
as
we
have
been
used
to
do
and
where
are
forcibly
brought
to
our
minds
the
hours
passed
by
us
so
instructively
in
the
gardens
of
zenobia
often
aurelian
is
of
our
company
and
throws
the
light
of
his
strong
intellect
upon
whatever
subject
it
is
we
discuss
he
can
not
however
on
such
occasions
thoroughly
tame
to
the
tone
of
gentle
society
his
imperious
and
almost
rude
nature
the
peasant
of
pannonia
will
sometimes
break
through
and
usurp
the
place
of
emperor
but
it
is
only
for
a
moment
for
it
is
amusing
to
himself
when
with
more
grace
than
one
would
look
for
he
acknowledges
his
fault
ascribing
it
sportively
to
the
fogs
of
the
german
marshes
it
amuses
us
to
observe
the
power
which
the
polished
manners
and
courtly
ways
of
livia
exercise
over
aurelian
whose
ambition
seems
now
as
violently
bent
upon
subduing
the
world
by
the
displays
of
taste
grace
and
magnificence
as
it
once
was
to
do
it
and
is
still
indeed
by
force
of
arms
having
astonished
mankind
in
one
way
he
would
astonish
them
again
in
quite
another
and
to
this
later
task
his
whole
nature
is
consecrated
with
as
entire
a
devotion
as
ever
it
was
to
the
other
livia
is
in
all
these
things
his
model
and
guide
and
never
did
soldier
learn
to
catch
from
the
least
motion
or
sign
of
the
general
his
will
than
does
he
to
the
same
end
study
the
countenance
and
the
voice
of
the
empress
yet
is
there
as
you
will
believe
knowing
the
mean
nor
servile
in
this
he
is
ever
himself
and
beneath
this
transparent
surface
artificially
assumed
you
behold
feature
for
feature
the
lineaments
of
the
fierce
soldier
glaring
forth
in
all
their
native
wildness
and
ferocity
yet
we
are
happy
that
there
exists
any
charm
potent
enough
to
calm
but
for
hours
or
days
a
nature
so
stern
and
cruel
as
to
cause
perpetual
fears
for
the
violences
in
which
at
any
moment
it
may
break
out
the
late
slaughter
in
the
very
streets
of
rome
when
the
coelian
ran
with
the
blood
of
fifteen
thousand
romans
butchered
within
sight
of
their
own
homes
with
the
succeeding
executions
naturally
fill
us
with
apprehensions
for
the
future
we
call
him
generous
and
magnanimous
and
so
he
is
compared
with
former
tyrants
who
have
polluted
the
throne
tiberius
commodus
or
maximin
but
what
title
has
he
to
that
praise
when
tried
by
the
standard
which
our
own
reason
supplies
of
those
great
virtues
i
confess
it
was
not
always
of
justice
it
was
indignation
at
crime
or
baseness
which
sometimes
brought
upon
him
the
charge
of
cruelty
never
the
wanton
infliction
of
suffering
and
death
but
it
certainly
is
not
so
now
a
slight
cause
now
rouses
his
sleeping
passions
to
a
sudden
fury
often
fatal
to
the
first
object
that
comes
in
his
way
but
enough
of
this
do
not
forget
to
tell
me
again
of
the
old
hermit
of
the
mountains
and
that
you
have
visited
him
if
indeed
he
be
yet
among
the
living
even
with
your
lively
imagination
fausta
you
can
hardly
form
an
idea
of
the
sensation
which
my
open
assertion
of
christian
principles
and
assumption
of
the
christian
name
has
made
in
rome
i
intended
when
i
sat
down
to
speak
only
of
this
but
see
how
i
have
been
led
away
my
letters
will
be
for
the
most
part
confined
i
fear
to
the
subjects
which
engross
both
myself
and
julia
most
such
as
relate
to
the
condition
and
prospects
of
the
new
religion
which
is
going
on
not
that
i
shall
be
speechless
upon
other
and
inferior
topics
but
that
upon
this
of
christianity
i
shall
be
garrulous
and
overflowing
i
believe
that
in
doing
this
i
shall
consult
your
preferences
as
well
as
my
own
i
know
you
to
be
desirous
of
principles
better
than
any
which
as
yet
you
have
been
able
to
discover
and
that
you
will
gladly
learn
whatever
i
may
have
it
in
my
power
to
teach
you
from
this
quarter
but
all
the
teaching
i
shall
attempt
will
be
to
narrate
events
as
they
occur
and
state
facts
as
they
arise
and
leave
them
to
make
what
impression
they
may
when
i
just
spoke
of
the
sensation
which
my
adoption
of
the
christian
system
had
caused
in
rome
i
did
not
mean
to
convey
any
idea
like
this
that
it
has
been
rare
for
the
intelligent
and
cultivated
to
attach
themselves
to
this
despised
religion
on
the
contrary
it
would
be
true
were
i
to
say
that
they
who
accept
christianity
are
and
they
rank
far
above
the
lowest
it
is
not
the
dregs
of
a
people
who
become
reformers
of
philosophy
or
religion
who
grow
dissatisfied
with
ancient
opinions
upon
exalted
subjects
and
search
about
for
better
and
adopt
them
the
processes
involved
in
this
change
in
their
very
nature
require
intelligence
and
imply
a
character
of
more
than
common
elevation
it
is
neither
the
lowest
nor
the
highest
who
commence
and
at
first
carry
on
a
work
like
this
but
those
who
fill
the
intermediate
spaces
the
lowest
are
dead
as
brute
matter
to
such
interests
the
highest
the
rich
the
fashionable
the
noble
from
opposite
causes
just
as
dead
or
if
they
are
alive
not
a
little
and
drawn
from
him
the
explanation
that
it
was
an
old
friend
of
his
who
had
gone
to
davy
jones
long
before
it
produced
a
somewhat
similar
effect
upon
him
on
the
present
occasion
and
he
muttered
ay
i
knows
him
it
looks
just
like
him
when
but
he
interrupted
himself
i
knows
him
he
repeated
poor
gentleman
his
name
was
mowbray
aubrey
aubrey
cried
the
intendant
with
a
smothered
voice
well
it
may
be
said
brown
but
i
always
thought
it
was
mowbray
and
sure
his
own
brother
the
sodger
told
us
so
the
skipper
and
me
when
he
bought
us
mowbray
and
poor
gentleman
the
hellcats
whereof
i
mean
the
d
d
spanish
constables
were
after
him
because
how
he
was
a
traitor
or
conspirator
or
whatsoever
you
call
it
and
so
we
sent
the
boat
and
took
him
off
by
night
him
and
the
rest
of
them
and
a
whole
chestful
of
money
and
off
went
the
sally
ann
a
bragging
through
blue
water
off
she
went
and
split
me
the
blue
water
soon
had
the
best
of
her
she
foundered
please
your
honour
s
excellency
and
the
skipper
and
the
passengers
with
poor
mr
aubrey
if
so
be
that
s
his
name
went
down
with
her
to
the
bottom
my
miserable
brother
cried
the
intendant
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
and
sinking
into
a
chair
but
starting
up
again
he
demanded
but
how
is
this
you
were
saved
others
were
saved
none
but
me
and
tim
aubrey
eagerly
demanded
turning
to
me
what
was
not
that
the
name
of
the
fellow
the
captain
of
the
sloop
just
before
us
this
question
which
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
not
without
alarm
lest
duck
should
be
sent
for
and
immediately
impeach
my
honest
acquaintance
had
the
effect
of
disturbing
the
latter
likewise
so
that
forgetting
his
former
assurance
that
he
knew
no
spanish
he
hastened
to
exclaim
there
s
more
ducks
than
swim
on
salt
water
but
this
here
fellow
ca
nt
be
tim
duck
because
how
davy
jones
has
got
him
fortunately
for
brown
the
intendant
was
too
much
excited
to
notice
the
inconsistency
and
brown
to
secure
his
attention
to
less
dangerous
subjects
immediately
resumed
his
story
none
but
me
and
tim
duck
said
he
stood
it
out
because
how
d
ye
see
we
took
to
the
boat
the
three
men
and
me
which
was
the
mate
and
which
jumped
after
us
and
that
was
all
of
us
when
we
pushed
off
what
then
cried
colonel
aubrey
my
poor
brother
was
abandoned
without
an
effort
to
save
him
why
d
ye
see
quoth
brown
he
would
run
below
after
the
younker
and
just
then
the
schooner
took
a
lurch
and
so
we
pushed
off
and
down
she
went
with
him
and
the
skipper
too
for
blast
me
he
was
lying
sick
in
his
bunk
unable
to
help
himself
and
so
we
pushed
off
in
the
boat
without
bread
water
or
compass
and
pitch
d
about
fourteen
days
on
a
stretch
and
two
of
the
men
they
died
and
says
i
to
tim
duck
says
i
tim
duck
we
must
draw
lots
and
says
he
to
me
let
s
do
for
the
niggur
and
so
he
killed
the
blacky
and
we
lived
on
him
six
days
boston
and
pick
d
us
up
and
there
shiver
my
timbers
your
honour
and
excellency
there
s
the
end
of
the
story
it
is
not
yet
the
end
of
it
said
colonel
aubrey
with
a
stern
voice
it
is
now
seventeen
years
since
that
vessel
sailed
out
of
her
port
never
more
to
enter
another
and
up
to
this
moment
not
a
word
of
her
fate
was
ever
breathed
to
human
being
and
no
one
but
believed
she
had
foundered
at
sea
and
that
every
soul
on
board
had
perished
with
her
how
comes
it
that
neither
you
nor
the
fellow
duck
the
survivors
of
the
wreck
ever
gave
information
of
the
calamity
to
any
one
to
owners
or
underwriters
how
could
this
have
happened
if
your
story
be
true
and
by
heaven
your
silence
throws
a
suspicious
character
over
what
was
before
only
deemed
a
natural
accident
of
the
sea
speak
fellow
though
you
pretend
to
have
forgotten
me
there
were
persons
who
said
the
mate
of
the
sally
ann
had
not
always
been
in
so
honest
a
vessel
and
was
not
the
safest
man
to
entrust
with
either
a
rich
cargo
or
the
life
of
a
wealthy
passenger
they
lied
then
d
n
their
blood
cried
brown
with
great
emphasis
for
the
mate
of
the
sally
ann
was
as
honest
a
lad
at
her
sailing
as
ever
rose
from
the
forecastle
to
the
quarter
deck
and
if
you
re
the
gentleman
poor
mr
mowbray
s
brother
whereof
i
disremember
who
made
the
bargain
with
the
skipper
and
me
and
brought
him
and
the
younker
and
the
young
niggur
and
the
money
aboard
you
must
know
the
old
skipper
said
i
was
to
have
the
schooner
next
voyage
blast
her
because
how
he
was
the
owner
and
he
was
old
and
he
knew
i
was
a
man
to
be
depended
on
and
as
for
this
here
thing
that
surprises
you
your
honour
never
heard
tell
of
the
sinking
of
the
schooner
till
now
why
sink
me
that
s
matter
soon
settled
for
d
ye
see
the
ship
that
pick
d
up
me
and
tim
duck
was
the
good
hope
of
boston
and
she
was
an
injieman
on
her
outward
voyage
and
so
says
captain
jones
her
commander
to
us
says
he
i
ll
send
you
back
to
the
states
by
the
first
return
ship
we
meets
or
i
ll
drop
you
at
the
cape
but
hang
me
there
was
no
return
ship
we
sees
and
when
we
comes
to
the
cape
there
was
nothing
there
and
the
good
hope
was
short
of
hands
because
she
lost
four
men
overboard
in
a
squall
and
says
captain
jones
though
mistress
saultz
had
been
gone
but
a
few
minutes
those
minutes
seemed
to
fitzvassal
as
many
hours
why
can
they
delay
so
thought
he
in
the
misery
of
his
impatience
who
are
they
inquired
the
dying
woman
stretching
her
pale
emaciated
fingers
in
the
direction
of
the
cellar
door
what
do
you
mean
my
dear
mother
replied
the
son
who
are
they
there
oh
now
i
know
look
at
them
edward
do
you
see
them
dearest
mother
ejaculated
her
son
believing
that
her
mind
had
wandered
and
that
any
further
reference
to
the
subject
would
add
to
her
delirium
they
are
beautiful
and
bright
creatures
see
they
are
beckoning
to
me
i
will
go
with
them
but
not
quite
yet
edward
my
love
are
you
here
fitzvassal
bowed
his
head
upon
his
mother
s
bosom
and
wept
like
a
child
god
unhappy
man
perceived
a
slight
shuddering
beneath
him
and
he
lifted
his
head
to
gaze
on
his
mother
s
corpse
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
heart
but
it
was
still
and
quiet
he
lifted
her
arm
and
it
fell
from
his
grasp
heavily
and
dead
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
their
sockets
and
as
he
pressed
the
cold
lids
upon
them
there
came
no
sign
of
life
and
he
held
his
hand
there
till
the
current
of
his
own
life
chilled
and
he
thought
of
her
seducer
and
his
affections
withered
up
while
his
heart
for
the
moment
overflowed
with
bitterness
the
bereaved
son
then
knelt
on
the
bare
ground
and
poured
forth
an
imprecation
deep
and
earnest
on
that
man
who
had
given
him
life
and
been
the
means
of
destroying
his
mother
and
before
he
rose
again
he
had
sworn
terribly
that
nothing
should
prevent
that
vengeance
which
the
sacrifice
before
him
demanded
yes
he
exclaimed
aloud
by
thy
sainted
spirit
thou
unheard
of
sufferings
by
thy
pale
lifeless
body
that
now
lies
before
me
i
swear
that
edmund
vassal
shall
bitterly
atone
for
this
deed
and
he
seated
himself
upon
the
side
of
the
stiffened
corpse
and
gave
vent
to
his
concentrated
misery
the
cellar
in
which
these
sufferings
were
showed
the
very
picture
of
penury
the
bare
ground
without
one
plank
to
keep
off
the
dampness
was
its
only
floor
and
this
so
wet
and
muddy
that
the
most
robust
health
would
have
sunk
under
its
influence
there
was
no
furniture
there
unless
a
couple
of
old
packing
boxes
could
be
called
such
which
served
for
a
bedstead
to
keep
the
straw
from
the
mud
and
another
which
was
used
for
a
table
other
than
these
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
called
so
the
cellar
door
was
much
broken
and
the
walls
of
which
the
apartment
was
made
were
so
dilapidated
that
in
the
day
time
one
could
not
well
help
seeing
into
the
street
such
was
the
lived
for
months
and
where
she
now
lay
in
cold
obstruction
dead
to
such
a
place
it
was
provided
that
her
miserable
son
should
be
led
that
he
might
take
the
blessing
of
his
mother
happy
for
him
if
his
heart
had
been
already
softened
by
suffering
to
receive
the
imprint
of
that
impression
which
her
dying
words
should
have
made
but
unprepared
for
so
great
a
calamity
his
heart
rebelled
against
the
ordinances
of
heaven
and
he
cursed
and
bemoaned
his
fate
as
one
which
had
been
cruelly
forced
on
him
and
which
he
believed
he
did
not
deserve
mrs
saultz
and
the
boy
willy
now
arrived
with
a
basket
containing
such
matters
as
was
judged
to
be
best
for
the
poor
woman
whose
spirit
had
already
gone
and
when
the
good
hearted
creature
found
that
she
was
dead
she
wept
with
unaffected
feeling
the
poor
boy
could
find
no
limits
to
his
affliction
he
threw
himself
on
the
lifeless
body
and
wept
bitterly
though
every
sort
of
consolation
was
offered
to
him
my
dear
lost
mammy
he
would
say
i
shall
never
see
you
again
oh
i
shall
never
forget
how
kind
and
tender
hearted
you
have
been
to
me
i
will
die
with
you
my
dear
dear
mammy
indeed
i
will
the
day
now
dawned
and
mistress
saultz
under
the
direction
of
fitzvassal
paid
all
those
melancholy
offices
to
the
dead
which
custom
and
propriety
render
necessary
a
suitable
coffin
was
procured
and
permission
obtained
from
the
apothecary
for
the
body
to
be
conveyed
to
his
own
house
from
which
it
was
intended
that
the
burial
should
proceed
the
boy
was
placed
under
the
care
of
mrs
saultz
and
fitzvassal
retiring
to
the
red
lion
called
for
a
room
on
entering
which
he
locked
the
door
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
exhausted
and
spiritless
in
a
few
moments
after
he
was
buried
in
a
death
like
slumber

boston
boys
it
was
broad
noon
before
our
adventurer
woke
from
the
heavy
slumber
in
which
the
excitement
and
suffering
of
the
previous
evening
had
thrown
him
as
soon
as
he
had
hurried
on
his
dress
and
taken
a
short
repast
he
proceeded
without
delay
to
the
house
of
the
hospitable
apothecary
where
he
found
every
thing
ready
prepared
for
the
funeral
in
less
than
two
hours
after
the
body
was
consigned
to
the
earth
but
fitzvassal
felt
that
its
spirit
was
still
around
him
to
warn
him
and
if
possible
to
keep
his
feet
from
falling
he
now
ascertained
from
the
boy
willy
who
had
been
in
the
poor
house
with
the
unfortunate
wife
of
classon
that
so
great
were
the
privations
and
so
humiliating
the
mortifications
to
which
they
had
been
compelled
to
submit
that
she
determined
to
rely
in
future
on
her
own
poor
abilities
to
support
herself
though
her
health
was
much
broken
and
there
did
not
seem
to
her
to
be
a
prospect
of
long
continuance
on
she
was
the
first
and
only
person
that
ever
seemed
to
take
any
interest
in
gone
