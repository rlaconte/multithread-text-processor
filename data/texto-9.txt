once
lived
in
the

house
with

dewitt

hearing
these
words
the
a
d
t
kid
ceased
weeping
and
cheerfully
proceeded
up
an
alley
where
he
played
wood
tag
moral
as
the
twig
is
bent
the
tree
is
inclined
the
fable
of
the
base
ball
fan
who
took
the
only
known
cure
once
upon
a
time
a
base
ball
fan
lay
on
his
death
bed
he
had
been
a
rooter
from
the
days
of
underhand
pitching
it
was
simply
pie
for
him
to
tell
in
what
year
anse
began
to
play
with
the
rockfords
and
what
kelly
s
batting
average
was
the
year
he
sold
for
ten
thousand
if
you
asked
him
who
played
center
for
boston
in
he
could
tell
you
quick
right
off
the
reel
and
he
was
a
walking
directory
of
all
the
glass
arms
in
the
universe
more
at
the
umpire
and
then
yelled
robber
until
his
pipes
gave
out
for
many
summers
he
would
come
home
one
evening
after
another
with
his
collar
melted
and
tell
his
wife
that
the
giants
made
the
colts
look
like
a
lot
of
colonial
dames
playing
bean
bag
in
a
weedy
lot
back
of
an
orphan
asylum
and
they
ought
to
put
a
trained
nurse
on
third
and
the
dummy
at
right
needed
an
automobile
and
the
new
man
could
nt
jump
out
of
a
boat
and
hit
the
water
and
the
short
stop
would
nt
be
able
to
pick
up
a
ball
if
it
was
handed
to
him
on
a
platter
with
water
cress
around
it
and
the
easy
one
to
third
that
ought
to
have
been
sponge
cake
was
fielded
like
a
one
legged
man
with
st
vitus
dance
trying
to
do
the
nashville
salute
illustration
the
fan
of
course
she
never
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
but
she
put
up
with
it
year
after
year
mixing
throat
gargle
for
him
and
reading
the
games
had
to
wear
a
green
shade
at
last
he
came
to
his
ninth
inning
and
there
were
two
strikes
called
and
no
balls
and
his
friends
knew
it
was
all
day
with
him
they
stood
around
and
tried
to
forget
that
he
was
a
fan
his
wife
wept
softly
and
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
possibly
he
would
have
amounted
to
something
if
there
had
been
no
national
game
she
forgave
everything
and
pleaded
for
one
final
message
his
lips
moved
she
leaned
over
and
listened
he
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
anything
in
the
morning
papers
about
the
condition
of
bill
lange
s
knee
moral
there
is
a
specific
bacillus
for
every
classified
disease
the
fable
of
the
good
fairy
with
the
lorgnette
and
why
she
got
it
good
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
broad
girl
who
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
no
children
to
look
after
so
she
thought
she
would
be
benevolent
she
had
scared
all
the
red
corpuscles
out
of
the
by
midget
who
rotated
about
as
her
husband
he
was
soft
for
her
and
so
she
got
it
mapped
out
with
herself
that
she
was
a
superior
woman
she
knew
that
when
she
switched
the
current
on
to
herself
she
used
up
about
ohms
an
hour
and
the
whole
neighborhood
had
to
put
on
blinders
she
had
read
about
nine
subscription
books
with
cupid
and
dove
tail
pieces
and
she
believed
that
she
could
get
away
with
any
topic
that
was
batted
up
to
her
and
then
slam
it
over
to
second
in
time
to
head
off
the
runner
her
clothes
were
full
of
pin
holes
where
she
had
been
hanging
medals
on
herself
and
she
used
to
go
in
a
hand
ball
court
every
day
and
throw
up
bouquets
letting
them
bounce
back
and
hit
her
illustration
the
midget
also
she
would
square
off
in
front
of
a
camera
every
two
weeks
and
the
man
was
next
for
he
always
removed
the
mole
when
he
was
touching
up
the
negative
in
the
photograph
the
broad
girl
resembled
pauline
hall
but
outside
of
she
showed
up
on
the
level
she
looked
like
a
street
just
before
they
put
on
the
asphalt
but
never
you
fear
she
thought
she
had
julia
arthur
and
mary
mannering
seventeen
up
and
one
to
play
so
far
as
good
looks
were
concerned
and
when
it
came
to
the
gray
matter
the
cerebrum
the
cerebellum
and
the
medulla
oblongata
may
wright
sewall
was
back
of
the
flag
and
pulled
up
lame
the
down
trodden
man
whom
she
had
dragged
to
the
altar
sized
her
all
right
but
he
was
afraid
of
his
life
he
was
nt
strong
enough
to
push
her
in
front
of
a
cable
car
and
he
did
nt
have
the
nerve
to
get
a
divorce
so
he
stood
for
everything
but
in
the
summer
when
she
skated
off
into
the
woods
to
hear
a
man
with
a
black
alpaca
coat
lecture
to
the
high
foreheads
about
the
subverted
ego
he
used
to
go
out
with
a
few
friends
and
tell
them
his
troubles
and
weep
into
his
beer
she
was
a
nice
woman
but
he
knew
better
annyhow
as
bobby
gaylor
used
to
say
she
became
restless
around
the
house
with
nothing
to
do
except
her
husband
so
she
made
up
her
mind
to
be
benevolent
to
beat
the
band
she
decided
that
she
would
allow
the
glory
of
her
presence
to
burst
upon
the
poor
and
the
uncultured
it
would
be
a
big
help
to
the
poor
and
uncultured
to
see
what
a
real
razmataz
lady
was
like
she
did
nt
propose
to
marion
cried
after
him
and
thank
you
a
thousand
times
he
turned
again
and
looked
back
at
them
but
in
their
rejoicing
they
had
already
forgotten
him
bless
you
my
children
he
said
smiling
girl
came
down
the
passage
toward
it
and
as
she
was
apparently
going
to
carroll
s
rooms
the
actor
left
the
door
open
behind
him
neither
marion
nor
carroll
had
noticed
his
final
exit
they
were
both
gazing
at
each
other
as
though
could
they
find
speech
they
would
ask
if
it
were
true
it
s
come
at
last
marion
philip
said
with
an
uncertain
voice
i
could
weep
cried
marion
philip
she
exclaimed
i
would
rather
see
that
play
succeed
than
any
play
ever
written
and
i
would
rather
play
that
part
in
it
than
oh
philip
she
ended
i
m
so
proud
of
you
and
rising
she
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
sobbed
on
his
shoulder
carroll
raised
one
of
her
hands
and
kissed
the
tips
of
her
fingers
gently
i
owe
it
to
you
marion
he
said
all
to
you
this
was
the
tableau
that
was
presented
on
her
errand
of
restitution
and
good
will
and
with
philip
s
ring
and
watch
clasped
in
her
hand
they
had
not
heard
her
nor
did
they
see
her
at
the
door
so
she
drew
back
quickly
and
ran
along
the
passage
and
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
she
did
not
need
now
to
analyze
her
feelings
they
were
only
too
evident
for
she
could
translate
what
she
had
just
seen
as
meaning
only
one
thing
that
she
had
considered
philip
s
love
so
lightly
that
she
had
not
felt
it
passing
away
from
her
until
her
neglect
had
killed
it
until
it
was
too
late
and
now
that
it
was
too
late
she
felt
that
without
it
her
life
could
not
go
on
she
tried
to
assure
herself
that
only
the
fact
that
she
had
lost
it
made
it
seem
invaluable
but
this
thought
did
not
comfort
her
she
was
not
deceived
by
it
she
knew
that
at
last
she
cared
for
him
deeply
and
entirely
in
her
distress
she
blamed
herself
bitterly
but
she
also
blamed
philip
no
he
might
have
known
that
i
must
love
him
in
time
she
repeated
to
herself
again
and
again
she
was
so
unhappy
that
her
letter
congratulating
philip
on
his
good
fortune
in
having
his
comedy
accepted
seemed
to
him
cold
and
unfeeling
and
as
his
success
meant
for
him
only
what
it
meant
to
her
he
was
hurt
and
grievously
disappointed
he
accordingly
turned
the
more
readily
to
marion
whose
interests
and
enthusiasm
at
the
rehearsals
of
the
piece
seemed
in
contrast
most
friendly
and
unselfish
he
could
not
help
but
compare
the
attitude
of
the
two
girls
at
this
time
when
the
failure
or
success
of
his
best
work
was
still
undecided
he
felt
that
as
helen
took
so
little
interest
in
his
success
he
could
not
dare
to
trouble
her
with
his
anxieties
concerning
it
and
she
attributed
his
silence
to
his
preoccupation
and
interest
in
marion
so
the
two
grew
apart
each
misunderstanding
the
other
and
each
troubled
in
spirit
at
the
other
s
indifference
the
first
night
of
the
play
justified
all
was
a
great
personal
triumph
for
the
new
playwright
the
audience
was
the
typical
first
night
audience
of
the
class
which
charles
wimpole
always
commanded
it
was
brilliant
intelligent
and
smart
and
it
came
prepared
to
be
pleased
from
one
of
the
upper
stage
boxes
helen
and
lady
gower
watched
the
successful
progress
of
the
play
with
an
anxiety
almost
as
keen
as
that
of
the
author
to
helen
it
seemed
as
though
the
giving
of
these
lines
to
the
public
these
lines
which
he
had
so
often
read
to
her
and
altered
to
her
liking
was
a
desecration
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
losing
him
indeed
as
though
he
now
belonged
to
these
strange
people
all
of
whom
were
laughing
and
applauding
his
words
from
the
german
princess
in
the
royal
box
to
the
straight
backed
tommy
in
the
pit
instead
of
the
painted
scene
before
her
she
saw
the
birch
trees
by
the
river
at
home
where
he
had
first
read
her
the
speech
to
which
they
were
now
listening
so
intensely
the
speech
in
which
the
hero
tells
the
girl
he
had
thought
how
wonderful
it
would
be
if
some
day
some
one
made
such
a
speech
to
her
not
philip
but
a
man
she
loved
and
now
if
philip
would
only
make
that
speech
to
her
now
he
came
out
at
last
with
wimpole
leading
him
and
bowed
across
a
glaring
barrier
of
lights
at
a
misty
but
vociferous
audience
that
was
shouting
the
generous
english
bravo
and
standing
up
to
applaud
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
box
where
helen
sat
and
saw
her
staring
down
at
the
tumult
with
her
hands
clasped
under
her
chin
her
face
was
colorless
but
lit
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
lady
gower
from
behind
her
was
clapping
her
hands
delightedly
but
my
dear
helen
she
remonstrated
breathlessly
you
never
told
me
he
was
so
good
looking
yes
said
helen
rising
abruptly
he
is
very
good
looking
she
crossed
the
box
to
where
her
cloak
was
hanging
but
folds
my
dear
child
cried
lady
gower
in
dismay
what
is
it
the
excitement
has
been
too
much
for
you
no
i
am
just
happy
sobbed
helen
i
am
just
happy
for
him
we
will
go
and
tell
him
so
then
said
lady
gower
i
am
sure
he
would
like
to
hear
it
from
you
to
night
philip
was
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
surrounded
by
many
pretty
ladies
and
elderly
men
wimpole
was
hovering
over
him
as
though
he
had
claims
upon
him
by
the
right
of
discovery
but
when
philip
saw
helen
he
pushed
his
way
toward
her
eagerly

took
her

pulled

he
was

on

one

a

secret
place
where
it
might
be
out
of
sight
and
touch
of
a
certain
searching
eye
and
mischievous
hand
well
known
and
feared
of
him
but
before
the
setting
sun
had
dropped
below
the
line
of
purple
mountain
tops
a
small
boy
who
will
be
known
in
these
annals
as
dicky
winship
might
have
been
seen
sitting
on
the
empty
paint
pot
while
from
a
dingy
pool
upon
the
ground
he
was
attempting
to
paint
a
copy
of
the
aforesaid
inscription
upon
the
side
of
a
too
patient
goat
who
saw
no
harm
in
the
operation
he
was
alone
and
very
very
happy
all
this
began
you
may
not
realise
it
dear
young
folks
but
this
method
of
telling
a
story
is
very
much
the
fashion
with
grown
up
people
and
of
course
i
am
not
to
blame
since
i
did
nt
begin
it
the
plan
is
this
you
must
first
write
a
chapter
showing
all
your
people
men
women
children
dogs
and
cats
in
a
certain
place
doing
certain
things
then
you
must
go
back
a
year
or
two
and
explain
how
they
all
happen
to
be
there
perhaps
you
may
have
to
drag
your
readers
twenty
five
years
into
the
regions
of
the
past
and
show
them
the
first
tooth
of
your
oldest
character
but
that
does
nt
matter
a
bit
the
further
the
better
then
when
everybody
has
forgotten
what
came
to
pass
in
the
first
chapter
you
are
ready
to
take
it
up
again
as
if
there
had
never
been
any
parenthesis
however
i
shall
not
introduce
you
to
the
cradles
cribs
or
trundle
beds
to
retrace
your
steps
one
week
and
look
upon
them
in
their
homes
on
one
of
the
pleasantest
streets
of
a
certain
little
california
town
stood
and
still
stands
for
aught
a
fool
to
quarrel
with
this
fellow
he
was
another
of
the
school
time
playmates
dispatch
to
his
wife
he
was
tormented
by
the
stern
words
of
the
young
orphan
s
telegram
i
act
under
his
last
wishes
find
randall
clayton
dead
or
alive
there
is
trouble
ahead
mused
ferris
and
i
have
made
enemies
of
all
the
officials
here
but
alice
is
mine
i
hold
her
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
my
wife
that
she
can
not
gainsay
when
he
had
sent
off
his
message
he
felt
strangely
cheered
by
the
reflection
that
worthington
probably
left
ten
to
fifteen
millions
behind
him
there
s
enough
for
all
he
cheerily
reflected
i
ll
let
her
play
miss
millions
a
bit
but
when
the
probate
proceedings
come
up
she
ll
find
a
husband
is
a
hard
thing
to
deal
with
he
was
wandering
back
to
the
office
determined
to
remove
at
once
all
of
his
private
data
and
personal
effects
to
the
fifth
avenue
when
he
stumbled
over
the
policeman
on
the
beat
bad
business
sir
this
of
mr
clayton
said
the
stalwart
irish
american
is
it
true
there
s
twenty
five
thousand
reward
out
with
a
sudden
inspiration
arthur
ferris
paused
mac
said
he
i
am
deeply
interested
here
i
ll
give
you
personally
five
thousand
dollars
more
for
the
first
clue
mind
you
no
publicity
the
policeman
s
eyes
sparkled
word
of
honor
he
said
yes
i
ll
write
it
in
your
presence
seal
it
and
give
it
to
you
this
promise
if
the
clue
leads
to
clayton
dead
or
alive
the
two
men
walked
along
in
the
streaming
crowd
ferris
felt
instinctively
that
the
officer
was
holding
something
back
what
do
the
reporters
say
hesitating
remarked
ferris
all
in
the
dark
a
pack
of
fools
unless
it
s
a
crime
that
gives
itself
away
to
any
one
they
know
nothing
and
the
force
has
not
picked
up
was
so
neatly
done
what
do
you
mean
quickly
queried
ferris
oh
any
gonoph
can
see
that
the
man
was
murdered
for
the
stuff
resolutely
said
mcnerney
he
was
no
fellow
to
clear
out
his
life
was
clean
as
a
whistle
i
know
all
about
him
how
can
you
prove
that
hotly
said
the
excited
lawyer
because
all
the
men
on
the
force
from
here
to
his
rooms
and
around
town
knew
him
for
a
clean
civil
honest
steady
fellow
one
in
ten
thousand
thief
he
never
said
mcnerney
not
on
your
life
ferris
stopped
i
will
be
at
the
fifth
avenue
night
and
day
said
the
vice
president
either
there
or
at
our
office
you
can
come
to
my
rooms
at
your
will
i
ll
leave
word
for
your
admittance
you
ll
have
your
money
in
ten
minutes
if
you
turn
up
any
sign
down
to
the
corner
where
he
had
seen
clayton
and
leah
einstein
enter
the
carriage
here
the
poor
fellow
began
his
ride
to
death
mused
dennis
i
must
have
that
reward
all
of
it
and
this
fellow
s
five
thousand
had
he
a
hand
in
it
i
ll
spot
him
from
to
night
but
the
jew
boy
has
the
key
of
the
secret
of
course
he
s
crafty
and
cowardly
in
a
month
he
will
throw
off
his
fear
when
i
catch
him
with
that
woman
i
ve
got
the
right
scent
of
the
whole
thing
then
i
ll
hunt
up
the
hack
driver
the
boy
is
the
key
and
if
the
force
finds
out
nothing
in
two
weeks
the
game
is
mine
if
the
boy
is
arrested
i
ll
get
in
with
the
woman
and
carriage
clue
i
can
wait
while
jack
witherspoon
and
doctor
atwater
conferred
at
the
hoffman
there
was
a
private
meeting
at
robert
wade
s
mansion
which
brought
together
all
the
brutal
treatment
announced
the
policy
of
a
united
resistance
a
joint
appeal
to
hugh
worthington
and
the
demand
of
an
investigation
committee
of
directors
we
will
wait
for
mr
worthington
s
vindication
said
wade
in
an
unanswerable
tone
then
you
will
wait
until
eternity
sadly
said
walter
edson
here
is
the
ten
o
clock
edition
of
the
evening
telegram
mr
hugh
worthington
the
well
known
capitalist
died
at
pasco
washington
this
morning
from
injuries
received
in
a
railroad
accident
when
the
hubbub
had
subsided
the
voice
of
wade
was
heard
gentlemen
we
must
act
in
a
passive
defence
until
the
worthington
estate
sends
in
a
man
to
control
the
situation
i
shall
move
that
three
of
us
retain
lawyers
to
defend
us
all
and
advise
us
as
to
our
joint
course
for
i
apprehend
mr
arthur
ferris
will
be
a
king
shark
if
he
rules
over
us
while
the
endangered
officials
burned
the
midnight
oil
the
hollow
eyed
arthur
ferris
was
hidden
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
dunham
dismissed
his
nephew
he
had
half
pooh
poohed
away
the
fears
of
the
young
schemer
of
course
the
girl
is
rattled
you
see
no
one
but
you
and
i
know
of
the
marriage
it
gives
you
an
iron
hold
upon
her
she
will
undoubtedly
be
advised
to
let
our
western
friends
escort
mr
worthington
s
body
on
to
detroit
there
of
course
she
will
be
met
by
the
family
lawyers
after
the
necessary
preliminaries
there
one
of
them
will
escort
her
on
here
and
i
will
be
within
reach
she
evidently
wishes
to
have
the
affair
of
the
marriage
made
public
some
time
later
if
you
made
worthington
do
the
right
thing
about
the
will
and
all
that
you
will
come
out
all
right
but
do
not
cross
her
wishes
you
can
not
spring
this
marriage
on
the
public
without
endangering
all
our
interests
my
lawyers
here
will
look
out
for
the
big
deal
you
can
bring
the
estate
reduced
your
wife
to
a
passive
mood
we
three
can
clue
up
all
the
private
affairs
i
will
be
near
you
i
think
you
are
borrowing
trouble
as
for
young
witherspoon
let
him
be
a
little
huffy
i
can
soon
whip
abundance
in
every
state
well
drilled
men
by
thousands
stood
ready
for
the
word
to
march
and
the
military
experience
and
knowledge
given
by
a
great
war
was
yet
strong
upon
of
the
war
appeared
a
very
obvious
and
a
very
simple
one
canada
had
given
the
offence
canada
should
be
made
to
pay
the
penalty
in
a
very
short
time
one
hundred
thousand
two
hundred
thousand
five
hundred
thousand
men
if
necessary
could
be
made
ready
for
the
invasion
of
canada
from
platform
pulpit
stump
and
editorial
office
came
the
cry
on
to
canada
at
the
seat
of
government
however
the
plan
of
the
war
did
not
appear
so
obvious
so
simple
throwing
a
great
army
into
canada
was
all
well
enough
and
that
army
would
probably
do
well
enough
but
the
question
which
produced
hard
breathing
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
was
the
immediate
protection
of
the
sea
coast
atlantic
gulf
and
even
pacific
in
a
storm
of
national
indignation
war
had
been
declared
against
a
power
which
at
this
period
of
her
history
had
brought
up
her
naval
forces
to
a
point
double
in
strength
to
that
of
any
other
country
in
a
nation
which
comparatively
speaking
possessed
no
naval
strength
at
all
for
some
years
the
united
states
navy
had
been
steadily
improving
but
this
improvement
was
not
sufficient
to
make
it
worthy
of
reliance
at
this
crisis
as
has
been
said
there
was
money
enough
and
every
ship
yard
in
the
country
could
be
set
to
work
to
build
ironclad
men
of
war
but
it
takes
a
long
time
to
build
ships
and
england
s
navy
was
afloat
it
was
the
british
keel
that
america
had
to
fear
by
means
of
the
continental
cables
it
was
known
that
many
of
the
largest
mail
vessels
of
the
british
transatlantic
lines
which
had
been
withdrawn
upon
the
declaration
of
war
were
preparing
in
british
ports
to
transport
troops
to
canada
it
was
not
impossible
that
these
great
steamers
might
land
an
army
in
canada
before
an
american
army
could
be
organized
and
marched
to
that
province
it
might
be
that
the
united
states
would
be
forced
to
defend
her
borders
instead
of
invading
those
of
the
enemy
in
every
iron
went
on
by
day
and
by
night
but
what
was
to
be
done
when
the
great
ironclads
of
england
hammered
upon
our
defences
how
long
would
it
be
before
the
american
flag
would
be
seen
no
more
upon
the
high
seas
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
government
found
its
position
one
of
perilous
responsibility
a
wrathful
nation
expected
of
it
more
than
it
could
perform
all
over
the
country
however
there
were
thoughtful
men
not
connected
with
the
government
who
saw
the
perilous
features
of
the
situation
and
day
by
day
these
grew
less
afraid
of
being
considered
traitors
and
more
willing
to
declare
their
convictions
of
the
country
s
danger
despite
the
continuance
of
the
national
enthusiasm
doubts
perplexities
and
fears
began
to
show
themselves
in
the
states
bordering
upon
canada
a
reactionary
feeling
became
evident
unless
the
united
states
navy
could
prevent
england
from
rapidly
pouring
into
canada
not
only
her
own
troops
but
perhaps
those
of
allied
nations
these
northern
states
might
become
the
scene
of
their
lands
might
be
ravished
their
people
suffer
from
many
quarters
urgent
demands
were
now
pressed
upon
the
government
from
the
interior
there
were
clamours
for
troops
to
be
massed
on
the
northern
frontier
and
from
the
seaboard
cities
there
came
a
cry
for
ships
that
were
worthy
to
be
called
men
of
war
ships
to
defend
the
harbours
and
bays
ships
to
repel
an
invasion
by
sea
suggestions
were
innumerable
there
was
no
time
to
build
it
was
urged
the
government
could
call
upon
friendly
nations
but
wise
men
smiled
sadly
at
these
suggestions
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
nation
desirous
of
a
war
with
england
in
the
midst
of
the
enthusiasms
the
fears
and
the
suggestions
came
reports
of
the
capture
of
american
merchantmen
by
fast
british
cruisers
these
reports
made
the
american
people
more
furious
the
american
government
more
anxious
almost
from
the
beginning
of
this
period
of
national
turmoil
a
party
of
gentlemen
met
daily
in
one
of
the
large
rooms
in
a
hotel
in
new
york
all
from
the
great
atlantic
cities
but
their
number
increased
by
arrivals
from
other
parts
of
the
country
until
at
last
they
numbered
twenty
three
these
gentlemen
were
all
great
capitalists
and
accustomed
to
occupying
themselves
with
great
enterprises
by
day
and
by
night
they
met
together
with
closed
doors
until
they
had
matured
the
scheme
which
they
had
been
considering
as
soon
as
this
work
was
done
a
committee
was
sent
to
washington
to
submit
a
plan
to
the
government
these
twenty
three
men
had
formed
themselves
into
a
syndicate
with
the
object
of
taking
entire
charge
of
the
war
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
this
proposition
was
an
astounding
one
but
the
government
was
obliged
to
treat
it
with
respectful
consideration
the
men
who
offered
it
were
a
power
in
the
land
a
power
which
no
government
could
afford
to
disregard
the
plan
of
the
syndicate
was
comprehensive
direct
and
simple
it
offered
to
assume
the
entire
control
and
expense
of
the
war
and
to
effect
a
this
contract
would
be
properly
performed
an
immense
sum
of
money
would
be
deposited
in
the
treasury
at
washington
should
the
syndicate
be
unsuccessful
this
sum
would
be
forfeited
and
it
would
receive
no
pay
for
anything
it
had
done
the
sum
to
be
paid
by
the
government
to
the
syndicate
should
it
bring
the
war
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
would
depend
upon
the
duration
of
hostilities
that
is
to
say
that
as
the
shorter
the
duration
of
the
war
the
greater
would
be
the
benefit
to
the
country
therefore
the
larger
must
be
the
pay
to
the
syndicate
according
to
the
proposed
contract
the
syndicate
would
receive
if
the
war
should
there
caught
view
of
the
young
detective
keeping
guard
outside
the
street
door
the
frenchman
was
greatly
excited
he
retreated
into
the
hall
and
went
upstairs
again
muttering

he
took
up
a
position
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
wondering
how
he
could
get
the
best
of
the
detectives
convinced
that
they
knew
all
about
his
smuggling
business
and
would
arrest
him
at
the
first
opportunity
it
made
him
so
desperate
that
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
kill
both
of
them
he
had
not
been
standing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
long
before
he
saw
harry
glide
into
the
hall
as
quietly
as
a
shadow
the
boy
was
becoming
impatient
over
his
partner
s
long
absence
and
made
up
his
mind
to
find
him
searching
the
lower
hall
he
failed
to
see
anything
of
old
king
brady
and
then
cautiously
made
his
way
upstairs
the
frenchman
saw
him
coming
he
slipped
into
the
room
where
the
old
detective
lay
raising
his
finger
to
his
wife
he
hissed

keeping
the
door
open
on
a
crack
when
darkness
fell
upon
the
room
he
peered
out
and
listened
intently
he
heard
the
young
detective
s
soft
footfalls
passing
the
door
and
he
stepped
out
into
the
hall
behind
harry
slight
as
the
noise
was
which
he
made
the
boy
heard
him
and
turned
around
striving
to
pierce
the
gloom
with
his
sight

the

suddenly
sprang
forward
with
both
hands
extended
struck
against
the

clutched
him
by
the
throat
and
knocked
him
over
backward
a
stifled
cry

he
was
knocked
down
and
struck
the
floor
with
a
crash
as
his

went

with

on

pulled

this
done
and
reynard
out

the

turned
to

at

and
asked

with

he
was
provided
with
a
hammer
and
some

and
taking
the

off
the

he
saw
that
it
was
amply
big
to
hold
the
detectives
bodies
some
of
the
joints
were
shrunk
open
he
noticed
which
would
admit
air
for
the
officers
to

this
would
keep
them
alive
some
time
if
they
were
not
killed
some

in

he
did
not
care
much
about
that
however
calling
his

to

him
he
went
into

room
where
the
two
bound
and
gagged
detectives
laid
upon
the

side

neither
could
move
or

they
were
wondering
what
their
fate
was
to

it
filled
them
with
chagrin
to
reflect
that
this
frenchman
had

overpowered

without

there
was

enough
to

when

they
realized

intended
to
do
with

and
it

child
like
look
full
of
trust
and
candor
as
she
seated
herself
in
the
chair
i
pointed
out
to
her
i
believe
so
i
hope
so
she
earnestly
assured
me
i
i
am
in
great
trouble
i
have
just
lost
my
husband
but
it
is
not
that
it
is
the
slip
of
paper
i
found
on
my
dresser
and
which
which
she
was
trembling
violently
and
her
words
were
fast
becoming
incoherent
i
calmed
her
and
asked
her
to
relate
her
story
just
as
it
had
happened
and
after
a
sufficiently
to
respond
with
some
degree
of
connection
and
self
possession
i
have
been
married
six
months
my
name
is
lucy
holmes
for
the
last
few
weeks
my
husband
and
myself
have
been
living
in
an
apartment
house
on
fifty
ninth
street
and
as
we
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
we
were
very
happy
till
mr
holmes
was
called
away
on
business
to
philadelphia
this
was
two
weeks
ago
five
days
later
i
received
an
affectionate
letter
from
him
in
which
he
promised
to
come
back
the
next
day
and
the
news
so
delighted
me
that
i
accepted
an
invitation
to
the
theater
from
some
intimate
friends
of
ours
the
next
morning
i
naturally
felt
fatigued
and
rose
late
but
i
was
very
cheerful
for
i
expected
my
husband
at
noon
and
now
comes
the
perplexing
mystery
in
the
course
of
dressing
myself
i
stepped
to
my
bureau
and
seeing
a
small
newspaper
slip
attached
to
the
cushion
by
a
pin
i
drew
it
off
and
read
it
it
was
a
death
notice
i
took
in
its
fatal
and
incredible
words
died
this
day
at
the
colonnade
james
forsythe
de
witt
holmes
new
york
papers
please
copy
james
forsythe
de
witt
holmes
was
my
husband
and
his
last
letter
which
was
at
that
very
moment
lying
beside
the
cushion
had
been
dated
from
the
colonnade
was
i
dreaming
or
under
the
spell
of
some
frightful
hallucination
which
led
me
to
misread
the
name
on
the
slip
of
paper
before
me
i
could
not
determine
my
head
throat
and
chest
seemed
bound
about
with
iron
so
that
i
could
neither
speak
nor
breathe
with
freedom
and
suffering
thus
i
stood
staring
at
this
demoniacal
bit
of
paper
which
in
an
instant
had
brought
the
shadow
of
death
upon
my
happy
life
nor
was
i
at
all
relieved
when
a
little
later
i
flew
with
the
notice
into
a
neighbor
s
apartment
and
praying
her
to
read
it
for
me
found
that
my
eyes
had
not
deceived
me
and
that
the
name
was
indeed
not
from
my
own
mind
but
from
hers
came
the
first
suggestion
of
comfort
it
can
not
be
your
husband
who
is
meant
said
she
but
some
one
of
the
same
name
your
husband
wrote
to
you
yesterday
and
this
person
must
have
been
dead
at
least
two
days
for
the
printed
notice
of
his
decease
to
have
reached
new
york
some
one
has
remarked
the
striking
similarity
of
names
and
wishing
to
startle
you
cut
the
slip
out
and
pinned
it
on
your
cushion
i
certainly
knew
of
no
one
inconsiderate
enough
to
do
this
but
the
explanation
was
so
plausible
i
at
once
embraced
it
and
sobbed
aloud
in
my
relief
but
in
the
midst
of
my
rejoicing
i
heard
the
bell
ring
in
my
apartment
and
running
thither
encountered
a
telegraph
boy
holding
in
his
outstretched
hand
the
yellow
envelope
which
so
often
bespeaks
death
or
disaster
the
sight
took
my
breath
away
summoning
my
maid
whom
i
saw
hastening
towards
me
from
an
for
me
sir
i
saw
in
her
face
before
she
had
read
the
first
line
a
confirmation
of
my
very
worst
fears
my
husband
was
the
young
widow
choked
with
her
emotions
paused
recovered
herself
for
the
second
time
and
then
went
on
i
had
better
show
you
the
telegram
taking
it
from
her
pocket
book
she
held
it
towards
me
i
read
it
at
a
glance
it
was
short
simple
and
direct
come
at
once
your
husband
found
dead
in
his
room
this
morning
doctors
say
heart
disease
please
telegraph
you
see
it
says
this
morning
she
explained
placing
her
delicate
finger
on
the
word
she
so
eagerly
quoted
that
means
a
week
ago
wednesday
the
same
day
on
which
the
printed
slip
recording
his
death
was
found
on
my
cushion
do
you
not
see
something
very
strange
in
this
i
did
but
before
i
ventured
to
express
myself
on
this
subject
learned
in
her
visit
to
philadelphia
her
answer
was
simple
and
straightforward
but
little
more
than
you
find
in
this
telegram
he
died
in
his
room
he
was
found
lying
on
the
floor
near
the
bell
button
which
he
had
evidently
risen
to
touch
one
hand
was
clenched
on
his
chest
but
his
face
wore
a
peaceful
look
as
if
death
had
come
too
suddenly
to
cause
him
much
suffering
his
bed
was
undisturbed
he
had
died
before
retiring
possibly
in
the
act
of
packing
his
trunk
for
it
was
found
nearly
ready
for
the
expressman
indeed
there
was
every
evidence
of
his
intention
to
leave
on
an
early
morning
train
he
had
even
desired
to
be
awakened
at
six
o
clock
and
it
was
his
failure
to
respond
to
the
summons
of
the
bell
boy
which
led
to
so
early
a
discovery
of
his
death
he
had
never
complained
of
any
distress
in
breathing
and
we
had
always
considered
him
a
perfectly
healthy
man
but
there
was
no
reason
for
assigning
any
so
the
burial
certificate
was
made
out
looked
at
him
a
minute
with
his
shiny
hat
an
boots
an
thought
of
my
ragged
ole
shirt
an
cotton
pants
an
ole
chip
hat
with
the
brim
most
gone
an
my
tin
pail
an
all
i
ai
nt
fit
to
i
says
ready
to
cry
an
wa
al
he
jes
laughed
an
says
nonsense
he
says
come
along
a
man
need
nt
be
ashamed
of
his
workin
clo
es
he
says
an
i
m
dum
d
if
he
did
nt
take
holt
of
my
hand
an
in
we
went
that
way
together
how
like
him
that
was
said
the
widow
softly
yes

am
yes

reckon
it
was
said
david
nodding
wa
al
he
went
on
after
a
little
pause
i
was
ready
to
sink
into
the
ground
with
shyniss
at

but
that
wore

the
widow
was
looking
at
david
with
shining
eyes
and
devouring
his
words
all
the
years
of
trouble
and
sorrow
and
privation
were
wiped
out
and
she
was
back
in
the
days
of
her
girlhood
ah
yes
how
well
she
remembered
him
as
he
looked
that
very
day
so
handsome
so
splendidly
dressed
so
debonair
and
how
proud
she
had
been
to
sit

word
i
do
nt
doubt
it
a
mossel
said
david
simply
leaning
over
and
poking
the
fire
which
operation
kept
his
face
out
of
her
sight
and
was
prolonged
rather
unduly
finally
he
straightened
up
and
blowing
his
nose
as
it
were
a
trumpet
said
wa

an
marched
me
off
to
the
barn
shed
without

says
wa
al
said
david
twisting
his
shoulders
in
recollection
i
wo
nt
harrer
up
your
feelin
s
s
i
told
you
he
done
his
best
i
was
willin
to
quit
long
fore
he
was
fact
was
he
overdone
it
a
little
an
he
had
to
throw
water
in
my
face
fore
he
got
through
an
he
done
that
as
thorough
as
the
other
thing
i
at
and
her
curls
loose
and
powdered
with
gold
well
the
three
drank
chocolate
in
the
gazebo
and
what
happened
no
one
knew
except
that
the
duke
on
taking
leave
gave
his
cousin
a
seat
in
his
carriage
but
the
cavaliere
never
returned
winter
approaching
and
the
poor
lady
thus
finding
herself
once
more
alone
it
was
surmised
among
her
women
that
she
must
fall
into
a
deeper
depression
of
spirits
but
far
from
this
being
the
case
she
displayed
such
cheerfulness
and
equanimity
of
humor
that
my
grandmother
for
one
was
half
vexed
with
her
for
giving
no
more
thought
to
the
poor
young
man
who
all
this
time
was
eating
his
heart
out
in
the
house
across
the
valley
it
is
true
she
quitted
but
nencia
would
have
it
she
looked
the
lovelier
for
the
change
and
so
gave
the
duke
greater
displeasure
certain
it
is
that
the
duke
drove
out
oftener
to
the
villa
and
though
he
found
his
lady
always
engaged
in
some
innocent
pursuit
such
as
embroidery
or
music
or
playing
games
with
her
young
women
yet
he
always
went
away
with
a
sour
look
and
a
whispered
word
to
the
chaplain
now
as
to
the
chaplain
my
grandmother
owned
there
had
been
a
time
when
her
grace
had
not
handled
him
over
wisely
for
according
to
nencia
it
seems
that
his
reverence
who
seldom
approached
the
duchess
being
buried
in
his
library
like
a
mouse
in
a
cheese
well
one
day
he
made
bold
to
appeal
to
her
for
a
sum
of
money
a
large
sum
nencia
said
to
buy
certain
tall
books
a
chest
full
of
them
that
a
foreign
pedlar
had
brought
him
whereupon
the
duchess
who
could
never
abide
a
book
breaks
out
at
him
with
holy
mother
of
god
must
i
have
more
books
about
me
i
was
nearly
smothered
with
them
in
the
first
year
of
my
marriage
and
the
chaplain
turning
red
at
the
affront
she
added
you
may
buy
them
and
welcome
my
good
chaplain
if
you
can
find
the
money
but
as
for
me
i
am
yet
seeking
a
way
to
pay
for
my
turquoise
necklace
and
the
statue
of
daphne
at
the
end
of
the
bowling
green
and
the
indian
parrot
that
my
black
boy
brought
me
last
michaelmas
from
the
bohemians
so
you
see
i
ve
no
money
to
waste
on
trifles
and
as
he
backs
out
awkwardly
she
tosses
at
him
over
her
shoulder
you
should
pray
to
saint
blandina
to
open
the
duke
s
pocket
to
which
he
returned
very
quietly
your
excellency
s
suggestion
is
an
admirable
one
and
i
have
already
entreated
that
blessed
martyr
to
open
the
duke
s
understanding
thereat
nencia
said
who
was
standing
him
out
of
the
room
and
then
quick
she
cried
to
my
grandmother
who
was
too
glad
to
run
on
such
errands
call
me
antonio
the
gardener
s
boy
to
the
box
garden
i
ve
a
word
to
say
to
him
about
the
new
clove
carnations
now
i
may
not
have
told
you
sir
that
in
the
crypt
under
the
chapel
there
has
stood
for
more
generations
than
a
man
can
count
a
stone
coffin
containing
a
thighbone
of
the
blessed
saint
blandina
of
lyons
a
relic
offered
i
ve
been
told
by
some
great
duke
of
france
to
one
of
our
own
dukes
when
they
fought
the
turk
together
and
the
object
ever
since
of
particular
veneration
in
this
illustrious
family
now
since
the
duchess
had
been
left
to
herself
it
was
observed
she
affected
a
fervent
devotion
to
this
relic
praying
often
in
the
chapel
and
even
causing
the
stone
slab
that
covered
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
to
be
replaced
by
a
kneel
by
the
coffin
this
was
matter
of
edification
to
all
the
household
and
should
have
been
peculiarly
pleasing
to
the
chaplain
but
with
respect
to
you
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
brings
a
sour
mouth
to
the
eating
of
the
sweetest
apple
however
that
may
be
the
duchess
when
she
dismissed
him
was
seen
running
to
the
garden
where
she
talked
earnestly
with
the
boy
antonio
about
the
new
clove
carnations
and
the
rest
of
the
day
she
sat
indoors
and
played
sweetly
on
the
virginal
now
nencia
always
had
it
in
mind
that
her
grace
had
made
a
mistake
in
refusing
that
request
of
the
chaplain
s
but
she
said
nothing
for
to
talk
reason
to
the
duchess
was
of
no
more
use
than
praying
for
rain
in
a
drought
winter
came
early
that
year
there
was
snow
on
the
hills
by
all
souls
the
wind
stripped
the
gardens
and
the
lemon
trees
were
nipped
in
the
lemon
house
the
duchess
kept
her
room
in
this
black
season
sitting
which
was
a
thing
she
had
never
done
and
praying
frequently
in
the
chapel
as
for
the
chaplain
it
was
a
place
he
never
set
foot
in
but
to
say
mass
in
the
morning
with
the
duchess
overhead
in
the
tribune
and
the
servants
aching
with
rheumatism
on
the
marble
floor
the
chaplain
himself
hated
the
cold
and
galloped
through
the
mass
like
a
man
with
witches
after
him
the
rest
of
the
day
he
spent
in
his
library
over
a
brazier
with
his
eternal
books
you
ll
wonder
sir
if
i
m
ever
to
get
to
the
gist
of
the
story
and
i
ve
gone
slowly
i
own
for
fear
of
what
s
coming
well
the
winter
was
long
and
hard
when
it
fell
cold
the
duke
ceased
to
come
out
from
vicenza
and
not
a
soul
had
the
duchess
to
speak
to
but
her
maid
servants
and
the
gardeners
about
the
place
yet
it
was
wonderful
my
grandmother
said
how
she
kept
her
brave
colors
prayed
longer
in
the
chapel
where
a
brazier
was
kept
burning
for
her
all
day
when
the
young
are
denied
their
natural
pleasures
they
turn
often
enough
to
religion
and
it
was
a
mercy
as
my
grandmother
said
his
gaze
and
found
her
eyes
on
tonga
s
shore
i
reigned
a
chief
and
now
i
am
a
beggar
at
your
mercy
then
the
young
pride
mounting
to
his
cheek
he
cried
nay
but
i
jested
for
i
come
so
far
to
green
kambara
for
a
lordly
bowl
fit
for
the
kava
of
a
chief
she
smiled
and
with
the
smile
malua
felt
the
blood
leap
in
his
heart
his
heart
inviolate
never
before
so
stirred
neath
woman
s
eyes
come
then
with
me
said
taka
and
the
beach
stretched
from
their
feet
a
ribbon
that
should
bind
in
its
white
length
the
heaven
to
the
earth
with
delicate
step
she
led
him
to
the
hut
where
old
akau
gave
him
kindly
greeting
a
little
in
the
shadow
where
the
gourds
and
strange
sweet
herbs
soft
musty
fragrances
hung
swinging
from
the
beams
about
her
head
and
lightly
folded
on
her
golden
breast
her
two
hands
lay
like
flowers
in
the
light
bright
as
a
sun
god
sat
malua
listening
with
greatest
reverence
to
the
aged
man
who
spoke
to
him
of
ancient
long
dead
things
while
he
displayed
his
wealth
of
burnished
cups
out
of
the
splendid
eld
my
son
he
said
yours
is
dim
future
mine
the
deathless
past
heroes
have
died
for
me
and
yet
shall
die
and
all
the
glory
of
the
virgin
earth
yields
up
its
sweets
to
me
for
now
i
rest
and
stretch
my
withered
sinews
in
the
sun
and
wait
for
peaceful
death
because
your
lips
are
innocent
and
dawn
is
in
your
eyes
i
give
you
of
my
store
the
fairest
treasure
after
my
taka
you
have
won
my
heart
in
his
strong
hand
he
laid
a
bowl
for
this
the
ages
had
paid
toll
soft
lightnings
shone
from
its
brown
glory
carved
most
royally
he
raised
the
kava
bowl
aloft
as
a
spear
shivered
the
dusk
where
taka
stood
the
light
lay
on
her
swelling
throat
and
showed
her
eyes
starred
like
a
tropic
night
the
stranger
s
hand
trembled
a
little
and
his
quick
drawn
breath
carried
a
message
from
his
breast
to
hers
they
left
the
hut
together
from
the
clear
bright
heat
of
noon
they
turned
and
took
their
way
into
the
greenly
silent
forest
leaves
flickered
above
wet
blossoms
simple
sounds
of
homely
labor
borne
upon
the
breeze
made
them
the
more
alone
they
spoke
of
love
a
mighty
word
to
ease
the
strange
new
pain
born
in
their
hearts
sudden
the
path
grew
wide
a
little
space
deprived
of
flowers
and
life
the
house
of
sandal
wood
said
taka
pointing
and
there
the
last
home
of
a
chief
it
lay
white
shells
and
snowy
pebbles
girt
him
round
in
his
great
mould
of
clay
and
all
his
spears
and
clubs
of
war
kept
vigil
showing
still
his
might
in
battle
shrill
the
parrot
s
to
withdraw
their
shadows
from
the
place
sacred
to
death
the
violent
crime
of
war
a
little
shadow
darkened
taka
s
heart
could
this
sweet
world
contain
both
death
and
love
she
sought
malua
s
eyes
to
be
assured
that
love
lives
always
he
had
gone
before
to
hold
the
leaves
for
her
to
pass
and
softly
she
came
and
like
a
golden
butterfly
her
small
hand
fluttered
down
upon
his
arm
he
caught
his
breath
as
tho
the
leaping
blood
that
fled
before
this
touch
were
very
flame
then
slowly
slowly
turned
and
in
her
eyes
gave
up
his
heart
s
desire
no
word
was
said
she
knew
not
that
she
loved
he
only
knew
she
was
the
moon
of
women
but
their
hearts
wiser
than
they
had
flowered
into
one
then
as
she
passed
beneath
the
swinging
leaves
he
caught
the
wreath
wherewith
on
tonga
s
shore
the
maids
had
crowned
him
king
of
love
and
beauty
and
cast
it
from
him
with
a
high
disdain
laughed
to
see
it
and
her
step
was
light
along
the
flowery
way
love
in
this
land
grows
into
perfect
stature
as
the
swift
sweet
growth
of
nature
in
these
gracious
souls
love
stood
full
armed
godlike
from
birth
their
lips
whispered
of
life
and
laughter
but
their
hearts
singing
together
told
each
other
clear
ah
love
dear
love
there
is
no
need
to
say
catch
up
life
s
song
its
lightest
merriest
word
pledge
deep
the
golden
sun
the
breeze
and
bird
draw
down
long
lashes
over
happy
eyes
that
none
may
guess
the
light
that
in
them
lies
nor
with
what
secret
smile
your
lips
are
stirred
the
moonlight
is
so
short
so
long
the
day
nay
love
dear
love
there
is
no
need
to
say
the
whole
world
laughed
with
flowers
overhead
the
sky
a
hollow
sapphire
ached
with
blue
the
green
bright
sea
gave
jewels
to
the
sun
and
all
the
air
was
love
that
in
the
midst
two
radiant
gods
with
brave
wide
eyes
and
hair
crowned
with
the
beatific
spring
they
stood
taka
the
fair
and
young
malua
fierce
passionate
hearted
youth
and
passionate
youth
faltering
before
her
innocent
gaze
he
cried
dare
i
adore
so
crystal
clear
she
seemed
a
silver
dewdrop
in
the
rose
of
dawn
and
taka
trembling
how
can
he
be
mine
so
strong
so
fair
a
god
with
heart
of
flame
and
so
they
strove
against
their
hearts
and
lived
long
lives
of
hope
and
fear
and
love
s
sweet
pain
within
a
heart
beat
but
the
time
was
near
there
in
mid
forest
rimmed
with
leaves
jade
green
all
singing
in
the
sun
as
deep
and
brown
as
taka
s
eyes
the
pool
disclosed
itself
across
the
clear
light
of
the
morning
showers
of
fiery
jewels
shone
against
the
trees
rubies
bright
sapphires
purple
amethyst
topaz
fierce
opal
grass
green
emeralds
flitting
bird
or
bird
made
flower
they
seemed
to
eyes
newborn
upon
a
world
of
love
the
air
was
heavy
with
strange
scents
the
old
familiar
perfumes
seemed
so
rarely
sweet
the
jasmine
was
the
very
breath
of
love
with
one
of
the
new
legions
that
they
will
doubtless
raise
and
you
will
believe
an
old
man
who
says
that
it
is
not
well
for
a
soldier
in
the
field
to
have
a
young
wife
at
home
sergius
flushed
and
was
silent
lest
his
answer
should
savour
of
pride
or
disrespect
toward
an
elder
suddenly
they
became
conscious
of
a
commotion
in
the
street
shrill
cries
were
borne
to
their
ears
and
a
moment
later
blows
fell
upon
the
outer
door
followed
by
the
grinding
noise
as
it
turned
upon
its
pivots
a
freedman
burst
into
the
atrium
titus
staff
as
if
to
punish
the
unceremonious
intrusion
then
he
noted
the
excitement
under
which
the
man
seemed
to
be
labouring
and
stood
stern
and
silent
to
learn
what
news
could
warrant
such
a
breach
of
decorum
it
is
maharbal
they
say
and
the
speaker
s
voice
came
almost
in
gasps
maharbal
and
the
numidians
not
at
the
gates
cried
both
young
men
springing
to
their
feet
but
the
other
shook
his
head
and
went
on
no
not
that
not
yet
but
he
has
cut
up
four
thousand
cavalry
in
umbria
with
caius
centenius
the
consul
had
sent
them
from
gaul
be
silent
commanded
the
elder
torquatus
surely
i
hear
the
public
crier
in
the
street
is
he
not
summoning
the
senate
velo
he
said
turning
to
the
freedman
you
are
pardoned
for
your
intrusion
go
now
and
bear
orders
from
me
to
arm
my
household
and
that
my
clients
and
freedmen
wait
upon
me
in
call
for
every
man
and
though
i
fear
titus
manlius
torquatus
can
not
strike
the
blows
he
struck
in
sicily
yet
even
his
sword
might
avail
to
pierce
light
armour
and
he
is
happy
in
that
he
can
give
those
to
the
state
whose
muscles
shall
suffice
to
drive
the
point
through
heavy
buckler
and
breastplate
shall
it
be
permitted
that
i
attend
you
to
the
senate
house
asked
caius
his
father
inclined
his
head
and
donning
the
togas
which
slaves
had
brought
they
hurried
into
the
street
hardly
noting
that
sergius
had
reseated
himself
and
was
gazing
absently
down
into
the
water
counting
the
ripples
that
spread
from
where
each
threadlike
stream
fell
from
its
dolphin
mouth
source
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
had
sat
thus
nor
was
he
perhaps
altogether
conscious
of
his
motive
in
failing
to
pay
the
aged
senator
the
honour
of
accompanying
him
at
least
so
far
as
the
gates
of
the
temple
of
concord
sounds
came
to
his
ears
from
the
apartments
above
of
velo
s
delivery
of
his
patron
s
commands
then
a
woman
s
laugh
rang
through
the
passage
that
led
back
to
the
garden
of
the
peristyle
sergius
rose
and
turned
just
as
a
girl
sprang
out
into
the
atrium
looking
back
with
a
laughing
challenge
to
some
one
who
seemed
to
pursue
her
but
who
hesitated
to
issue
from
the
protecting
darkness
what
do
you
fear
minutia
she
cried
my
father
and
caius
have
gone
and
there
is
no
one
oh
suddenly
she
became
conscious
of
sergius
presence
and
her
olive
cheeks
flushed
to
a
rich
crimson
then
she
faced
him
with
an
air
of
pretty
defiance
and
went
on
no
one
here
but
lucius
sergius
fidenas
who
should
have
business
elsewhere
sergius
said
nothing
but
continued
to
stand
with
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
upon
her
face
her
figure
was
tall
slender
and
very
graceful
her
hair
and
eyes
were
dark
and
her
features
delicate
and
perfectly
moulded
over
all
was
forgetfulness
of
serious
things
that
only
comes
to
young
girls
his
attentive
silence
seemed
at
last
to
disturb
her
an
annoyed
look
drove
the
smile
from
her
lips
and
with
an
almost
imperceptible
side
motion
of
her
small
head
she
went
on
surely
lucius
sergius
fidenas
has
not
allowed
my
father
to
go
to
the
senate
house
with
only
caius
to
attend
him
lucius
respects
my
father
too
much
for
that
and
too
disinterestedly
it
is
an
even
more
serious
omission
than
his
failure
to
attend
the
consul
at
trasimenus
sergius
eyes
blazed
at
the
taunt
and
struggling
with
the
answer
that
rose
to
his
lips
he
said
nothing
for
fear
he
might
say
too
much
the
girl
watched
him
closely
her
mirth
returned
a
little
at
the
sight
of
his
confusion
and
with
her
mirth
came
something
of
mercy
oh
to
be
sure
his
wound
i
almost
forgot
that
tell
me
my
brave
lucius
did
the
gauls
bite
hard
when
they
caught
you
to
tanes
how
funny
for
naked
gauls
to
ambush
roman
legionaries
and
chase
them
home
father
has
not
spoken
to
uncle
cneus
since
he
says
it
was
his
duty
to
have
remained
on
the
field
and
i
suppose
he
thinks
it
was
yours
too
instead
of
running
away
like
a
fox
to
be
shut
up
in
his
hole
sergius
had
recovered
his
composure
now
but
his
brow
was
clouded
you
are
as
cruel
as
ever
marcia
he
said
and
yet
i
know
you
have
heard
that
it
was
the
men
of
my
maniple
who
carried
me
away
senseless
from
the
blow
of
a
dead
man
oh
you
did
kill
him
i
remember
now
she
resumed
with
some
display
of
interest
you
had
run
him
through
had
you
not
and
he
just
let
his
big
sword
drop
on
your
head
i
got
caius
to
show
me
about
it
and
i
was
the
gaul
caius
did
not
stab
me
but
had
a
sore
head
for
two
days
i
meant
it
for
you
because
you
are
trying
to
make
an
old
woman
of
me
when
i
am
hardly
a
girl
marcia
began
lucius
but
she
raised
her
hand
warningly
and
went
on
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
why
my
father
will
not
let
you
marry
me
now
there
are
two
reasons
one
because
i
do
nt
want
him
to
and
another
because
he
thinks
you
must
do
something
great
to
wipe
out
the
stain
of
a
roman
centurion
s
more
but
some
mysterious
force
conveyed
to
his
mind
a
perfect
portrait
of
swearengen
jones
in
the
act
of
putting
down
a
large
black
mark
against
him
and
he
forbore
i
wish
i
knew
whether
i
had
to
abide
by
the
new
york
or
the
montana
standard
of
extravagance
brewster
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
he
ever
sees
the
new
york
papers
late
each
night
the
last
of
the
grand
old
brewster
family
went
to
his
bedroom
where
after
dismissing
his
man
he
settled
down
at
his
desk
with
a
pencil
and
a
pad
of
paper
lighting
the
candles
which
were
more
easily
managed
he
found
than
lamps
and
much
more
costly
day
nopper
harrison
and
elon
gardner
had
the
receipts
for
all
moneys
spent
and
joe
bragdon
was
keeping
an
official
report
but
the
chief
as
they
called
him
could
not
go
to
sleep
until
he
was
satisfied
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
keeping
up
the
average
for
the
first
two
weeks
it
had
been
easy
in
fact
he
seemed
to
have
quite
a
comfortable
lead
in
the
race
he
had
spent
almost
in
the
fortnight
but
he
realized
that
the
greater
part
of
it
had
gone
into
the
yearly
and
not
the
daily
expense
account
he
kept
a
profit
and
loss
entry
in
his
little
private
ledger
but
it
was
not
like
any
other
account
of
the
kind
in
the
world
what
the
ordinary
merchant
would
have
charged
to
loss
he
jotted
down
on
the
profit
side
and
he
was
continually
looking
for
opportunities
to
swell
the
total
rawles
who
had
been
his
grandfather
s
butler
since
the
day
after
he
landed
in
new
greatly
to
the
wrath
and
confusion
of
the
latter
s
aunt
emmeline
the
chef
came
from
paris
and
his
name
was
detuit
ellis
the
footman
also
found
a
much
better
berth
with
monty
than
he
had
had
in
the
house
on
the
avenue
aunt
emmeline
never
forgave
her
nephew
for
these
base
and
disturbing
acts
of
treachery
as
she
called
them
one
of
monty
s
most
extraordinary
financial
feats
grew
out
of
the
purchase
of
a
automobile
he
blandly
admitted
to
nopper
harrison
and
the
two
secretaries
that
he
intended
to
use
it
to
practice
with
only
and
that
as
soon
as
he
learned
how
to
run
an
auto
as
it
should
be
run
he
expected
to
buy
a
good
sensible
durable
machine
for
his
staff
officers
frequently
put
their
heads
together
to
devise
ways
and
means
of
curbing
monty
s
reckless
extravagance
they
were
worried
he
s
like
a
sailor
in
port
protested
harrison
money
is
no
object
if
he
wants
a
thing
and
damn
it
wo
nt
last
long
gardner
said
reassuringly
like
his
namesake
monte
cristo
the
world
is
his
just
now
and
he
wants
to
enjoy
it
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
it
it
seems
to
me
whenever
they
reproached
brewster
about
the
matter
he
disarmed
them
by
saying
now
that
i
ve
got
money
i
mean
to
give
my
friends
a
good
time
just
what
you
d
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
what
s
money
for
anyway
but
this
a
plate
dinner
i
m
going
to
give
a
dozen
of
them
and
even
then
i
ca
nt
pay
my
just
debts
for
years
i
ve
been
entertained
at
people
s
houses
and
have
been
taken
cruising
on
their
yachts
they
have
always
been
bully
to
me
and
what
have
i
ever
done
for
them
nothing
now
that
i
can
afford
it
i
am
going
to
return
some
of
those
favors
and
square
myself
does
nt
it
sound
reasonable
in
addition
to
what
he
called
his
efficient
corps
of
gentlemanly
aids
he
had
secured
the
services
of
mrs
dan
demille
as
social
mentor
and
utility
chaperon
mrs
demille
was
known
in
the
papers
as
the
leader
of
the
fast
younger
married
set
she
was
one
of
the
cleverest
and
best
looking
young
women
in
town
and
her
husband
was
of
those
who
did
not
have
to
be
invited
too
mr
demille
lived
at
the
club
and
visited
his
home
some
one
said
that
he
was
so
slow
and
his
wife
so
fast
that
when
she
invited
him
to
dinner
he
usually
was
two
or
three
days
late
altogether
mrs
demille
was
a
decided
acquisition
to
brewster
s
campaign
committee
it
required
just
her
touch
to
make
his
parties
fun
instead
of
funny
it
was
on
october
th
that
the
dinner
was
given
with
the
skill
of
a
general
mrs
dan
had
seated
the
guests
in
such
a
way
that
from
the
beginning
things
went
off
with
zest
colonel
drew
took
in
mrs
valentine
and
beautiful
miss
valentine
were
side
by
side
and
no
one
could
say
he
looked
unhappy
mr
cromwell
went
in
with
mrs
savage
and
the
same
delicate
tact
in
some
cases
it
was
almost
indelicate
was
displayed
in
the
disposition
of
other
guests
somehow
they
had
come
with
the
expectation
of
being
bored
curiosity
prompted
them
to
accept
but
it
did
not
prevent
the
subsequent
inevitable
lassitude
socially
monty
brewster
had
yet
to
make
himself
felt
he
and
his
dinners
were
something
to
talk
about
but
they
were
accepted
hesitatingly
haltingly
people
wondered
how
he
had
secured
the
cooperation
of
mrs
dan
but
then
mrs
dan
always
did
go
in
for
a
new
toy
to
her
was
inevitably
attributed
whatever
success
the
dinner
achieved
and
it
was
no
small
measure
yet
there
was
nothing
startling
about
the
affair
monty
had
decided
to
begin
conservatively
he
did
the
conventional
thing
but
he
did
it
well
he
added
a
touch
or
two
of
luxury
the
faintest
aroma
of
splendor
pettingill
had
designed
the
curiously
and
arranged
its
decoration
of
great
lavender
orchids
and
lacy
butterfly
festoons
of
white
ones
touched
with
yellow
he
had
wanted
to
use
dahlias
in
their
many
rich
shades
from
pale
yellow
to
orange
and
deep
red
but
monty
held
out
for
orchids
it
was
the
artist
too
who
the
ruined
walls
of
a
castle
and
set
his
pack
down
beside
him
to
rest
after
the
fatigues
of
his
journey
this
is
looking
round
and
these
dark
yew
trees
conceal
it
very
well
from
the
road
i
shall
come
here
always
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
the
sun
is
too
hot
and
count
over
my
gains
how
hard
my
mistress
the
lizard
makes
me
work
who
would
have
thought
she
would
have
wished
to
deck
her
green
head
with
opals
down
there
where
there
are
only
a
tribe
of
brown
gnomes
to
see
her
but
i
have
not
given
her
that
one
out
of
the
ring
which
i
stole
nor
three
others
that
i
conjured
out
of
the
crozier
of
the
priest
as
i
knelt
at
the
altar
and
they
thought
i
was
rehearsing
a
prayer
to
the
virgin
after
resting
some
time
the
pedlar
took
up
his
pack
and
went
boldly
on
to
the
gardens
never
doubting
but
that
hulda
was
dead
but
it
so
happened
that
at
that
moment
hulda
and
her
mother
sat
at
work
in
a
shady
part
of
the
garden
under
some
elder
trees
what
is
the
matter
the
bird
pecked
her
wrist
and
fluttered
its
wings
and
opened
its
beak
as
if
it
were
very
much
frightened
let
us
go
mother
and
look
about
us
said
hulda
so
they
both
got
up
and
wandered
all
over
the
gardens
but
the
pedlar
in
the
meantime
had
walked
on
toward
the
town
and
they
saw
nothing
of
him
sing
to
me
my
sweet
bird
said
hulda
that
night
as
she
lay
down
to
sleep
tell
me
why
you
pecked
my
wrist
then
the
bird
sang
to
her
who
came
from
the
ruin
the
ivy
clad
ruin
with
old
shaking
arches
all
moss
overgrown
where
the
flitter
bat
hideth
the
limber
snake
glideth
and
chill
water
drips
from
the
slimy
green
stone
who
did
asked
hulda
not
the
pedlar
surely
tell
me
my
pretty
bird
but
the
bird
only
chirped
a
little
and
fluttered
its
golden
wings
so
hulda
ceased
the
bird
woke
her
by
pecking
her
wrist
very
early
almost
before
sunrise
and
sang
who
dips
a
brown
hand
in
the
chill
shaded
water
the
water
that
drips
from
a
slimy
green
stone
who
flings
his
red
cap
at
the
owlets
that
flap
their
white
wings
in
his
face
as
he
sits
there
alone
hulda
upon
hearing
this
arose
in
great
haste
and
dressed
herself
then
she
went
to
her
father
and
mother
and
entreated
that
they
would
come
with
her
to
the
old
ruin
it
was
now
broad
day
so
they
all
three
set
out
together
it
was
a
very
hot
morning
the
dust
lay
thick
upon
the
road
and
there
was
not
air
enough
to
stir
the
thick
leaves
of
the
trees
which
hung
overhead
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
found
themselves
in
a
crowd
of
people
all
going
toward
the
castle
ruin
for
there
they
told
hulda
the
pedlar
the
famous
pedlar
from
the
north
who
sold
such
fine
wares
surprising
cleverness
child
whispered
hulda
s
mother
nothing
could
be
more
fortunate
for
us
let
us
mingle
with
the
crowd
and
get
close
to
the
pedlar
hulda
assented
to
her
mother
s
wish
but
the
heat
and
dust
together
with
her
own
intense
desire
to
rescue
the
lost
wand
made
her
tremble
so
that
she
had
great
difficulty
in
walking
they
went
among
gypsies
fruit
women
peasant
girls
children
travelling
musicians
common
soldiers
and
laborers
the
heat
increased
and
the
dust
and
the
noise
and
at
last
hulda
and
her
parents
were
borne
forward
into
the
old
ruin
among
a
rush
of
people
running
and
huzzaing
and
heard
the
pedlar
shout
to
them
keep
back
good
people
leave
a
space
before
me
leave
a
large
space
between
me
and
you
so
they
pressed
back
again
jostling
and
crowding
each
other
and
left
an
open
space
before
him
from
which
he
looked
at
them
with
his
cunning
black
eyes
and
spring
the
place
was
open
to
the
sky
and
the
broken
arches
and
walls
were
covered
with
thick
ivy
and
wall
flowers
the
pedlar
sat
on
a
large
gray
stone
with
his
red
cap
on
and
his
brown
fingers
adorned
with
splendid
rings
and
he
spread
them
out
and
waved
his
hands
to
the
people
with
ostentatious
ceremony
now
good
people
he
said
without
rising
from
his
seat
you
are
about
to
see
the
finest
rarest
and
most
wonderful
exhibition
of
the
conjuring
art
ever
known
stop
cried
a
woman
s
voice
from
the
crowd
and
a
young
girl
rushed
wildly
forward
from
the
people
who
had
been
trying
to
hold
her
back
i
impeach
you
before
all
these
witnesses
she
cried
seizing
him
by
the
hand
see
justice
done
good
people
i
impeach
you
pedlar
where

the
ring
my
mother
s
ring
which
you
stole
on
midsummer
s
day
in
the
castle
good
people
his
face
and
speaking
in
a
mild
fawning
voice
i
hope
you
ll
protect
me
i
hope
you
wo
nt
see
me
insulted
my
ring
my
ring
cried
hulda
he
wore
it
on
his
finger
but
now
show
your
hand
like
a
man
said
the
people
if
the
lady
says
falsely
ca
nt
you
face
her
and
tell
her
so
never
hold
it
down
so
cowardly
the
pedlar
had
tucked
his
feet
under
him
and
when
the
people
cried
out
to
him
to
let
the
rings
on
his
hand
be
seen
he
had
already
burrowed
with
them
up
to
his
knees
in
the
earth
illustration
the
pedlar
had
now
sunk
up
to
his
waist
oh
he
will
go
down
into
the
earth
cried
hulda
but
i
will
not
let
go
pedlar
pedlar
it
is
useless
if
i
follow
you
before
the
lizard
your
mistress
i
will
not
let

upon

and
sank
lower
and

the
people
were
too
frightened
to
move

cried
her
mother
oh
he
will
go
down
highness
said
i
ll
ring
the
bell
and
stay
till
morning
in
it
he
took
hobson
s
choice
for
no
hotel
there
was
in
the
vicinity
his
ringing
was
so
vehement
that
any
but
in
spite
of
all
the
din
there
was
no
answer
audible
and
so
with
courage
laudable
his
royal
highness
turned
the
knob
and
stoutly
entered
in
then
he
strode
across
the
court
but
he
suddenly
stopped
short
when
he
passed
within
the
castle
by
a
massive
oaken
door
there
were
courtiers
without
number
but
they
all
were
plunged
in
slumber
the
prince

ear
delighting
by
uniting
in
a
snore

prince
remarked
this

so
was
born

jest

this
shows
how
the
prince
won
the
princess

heart

torpor

chamberlains
all
slumbered
like

dead

snored

mournfully

charming
passed
them
scornfully
and
came
to
where
a
princess
lay
asleep
upon
a
bed
she
was
so
extremely
fair
that
his
highness
did

from

the
princess
met
his
eye
her
glance
at
first
was
critical
and
sternly
analytical
and
then
she
dropped
her
lashes
and
she
gave
a
little
sigh
as
he
watched
her
wholly
dumb
she
observed
you
doubtless
come
for

ask
you

was
when

grew

i
am
very
sorry
for
it
but
i
do
nt
quite
understand
it
well
i
do
and
i
m
going
to
put
an
end
to
it
i
m
going
to
have
it
out
with
ned
keene
he
is
breaking
her
heart
but
are
you
the
right
one
to
take
the
matter
up
who
else
is
there
to
do
it
her
father
he
sees
nothing
comprehends
nothing
practical
type
poetic
type
misunderstandings
sure
to
arise
come
together
after
a
while
each
supply
the
other
s
deficiencies
cursed
folly
and
the
it
shall
not
go
on
i
say
keene
is
out
on
the
road
now
taking
one
of
his
infernal
walks
i
m
going
to
meet
him
i
m
afraid
it
will
make
trouble
let
me
go
with
you
the
trouble
is
made
come
if
you
like
i
m
going
now
the
night
lay
heavy
upon
the
forest
where
the
road
dipped
through
the
valley
we
could
hardly
see
a
rod
ahead
of
us
but
higher
up
where
the
way
curved
around
the
breast
of
the
mountain
the
woods
were
thin
on
the
left
and
on
the
right
a
sheer
precipice
fell
away
to
the
gorge
of
the
brook
in
the
dim
starlight
we
saw
keene
striding
toward
us
graham
stepped
out
to
meet
him
where
have
you
been
ned
keene
he
cried
the
cry
was
a
challenge
keene
lifted
his
head
and
stood
still
then
he
laughed
and
took
a
step
forward
taking
a
long
walk
jack
graham
should
have
been
with
me
but
why
this
sudden
question
because
your
long
walk
is
a
pretence
you
are
playing
false
there
is
some
woman
that
you
go
to
see
at
west
point
at
highland
falls
who
knows
where
keene
laughed
again
certainly
you
do
nt
know
my
dear
fellow
and
neither
do
i
since
when
has
walking
become
a
vice
in
your
estimation
you
seem
to
be
in
a
fierce
mood
what
s
the
matter
i
will
tell
you
what
s
the
matter
you
have
been
acting
like
a
brute
to
the
girl
you
profess
to
love
plain
words
but
between
friends
frankness
is
best
did
she
ask
you
to
tell
me
no
you
know
too
well
she
would
die
before
she
would
speak
you
are
killing
her
that
is
what
you
are
doing
with
your
devilish
moods
and
mysteries
you
must
stop
do
you
hear
you
must
give
her
up
i
hear
her
and
two
for
yourself
is
that
it
damn
you
cried
the
younger
man
let
the
words
go
we
ll
settle
it
this
way
and
he
sprang
at
the
other
s
throat
keene
cool
and
well
braced
met
him
with
a
heavy
blow
in
the
chest
he
recoiled
and
i
rushed
between
them
holding
graham
back
and
pleading
for
self
control
as
we
stood
thus
panting
and
confused
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
a
singing
voice
floated
up
to
us
from
the
shadows
across
the
valley
it
was
herrick
s
song
again
a
heart
as
soft
a
heart
as
kind
a
heart
as
sound
and
free
is
in
the
whole
world
thou
canst
find
that
heart
i
ll
give
to
thee
come
gentlemen
i
cried
this
is
folly
sheer
madness
you
can
never
deal
with
the
matter
in
this
way
think
of
the
girl
who
is
singing
down
yonder
what
would
happen
to
from
her
own
feelings
if
either
of
you
should
be
killed
or
even
seriously
hurt
by
the
other
there
must
be
no
quarrel
between
you
certainly
said
keene
whose
poise
if
shaken
at
all
had
returned
certainly
you
are
right
it
is
not
of
my
seeking
nor
shall
i
be
the
one
to
keep
it
up
i
am
willing
to
let
it
pass
it
is
but
a
small
matter
at
most
i
turned
to
graham
and
you
he
hesitated
a
little
and
then
said
doggedly
on
one
condition
and
that
is
keene
must
explain
he
must
answer
my
question
do
you
accept
i
asked
keene
yes
and
no
he
replied
no
to
answering
graham
s
question
he
is
not
the
person
to
ask
it
i
wonder
that
he
does
not
see
the
impropriety
the
absurdity
of
his
meddling
at
all
in
this
even
if
he
believed
it
but
to
the
explanation
i
say
yes
i
will
give
it
not
to
graham
but
to
you
i
make
you
this
proposition
to
morrow
is
sunday
we
shall
be
excused
from
service
if
we
tell
the
master
that
we
have
important
business
to
settle
together
you
shall
come
with
me
on
one
of
my
long
walks
i
will
tell
you
all
about
them
then
you
can
be
the
judge
whether
there
is
any
harm
in
them
does
that
satisfy
you
i
said
to
graham
yes
he
answered
that
seems
fair
enough
i
am
content
to
leave
it
in
that
way
for
the
present
and
to
make
it
still
more
fair
i
want
to
take
back
what
i
said
awhile
ago
and
to
ask
keene
s
pardon
for
it
not
at
all
said
keene
quickly
it
was
said
in
haste
i
bear
no
grudge
you
simply
did
not
understand
that
the
hill
and
as
we
turned
dorothy
met
us
coming
out
of
the
shadows
what
are
you
men
doing
here
she
asked
i
heard
your
voices
from
below
what
were
you
talking
about
we
were
talking
said
keene
my
dear
dorothy
we
were
talking
about
walking
yes
that
which
you
believe
a
distant
and
indifferent
god
has
denied
you
to
you
i
declare
that
in
this
encircling
ever
present
invisible
exhaustless
beneficence
is
already
provided
a
lavish
abundance
of
everything
which
you
can
possibly
want
or
think
nay
desire
itself
is
but
god
good
love
knocking
at
the
door
of
your
consciousness
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
desire
anything
that
is
not
already
your
own
it
only
remains
for
you
to
bring
the
invisible
into
visibility
to
take
of
the
everlasting
substance
what
you
will
and
how
must
you
do
this
ask
and
believe
that
you
have
you
have
asked
many
times
perhaps
and
have
failed
to
receive
why
you
have
failed
to
believe
ask
then
for
what
you
will
ask
and
at
once
asking
and
believing
is
the
thing
itself
made
manifest
declare
that
it
is
yours
expect
it
believe
it
hold
to
it
without
wavering
no
matter
how
empty
your
hands
may
seem
it
is
yours
and
god
s
infinite
creation
shall
lapse
into
nothingness
his
stars
shall
fall
from
high
heaven
like
withered
leaves
sooner
than
that
you
shall
fail
to
obtain
all
that
you
have
asked
when
at
the
close
of
the
lecture
mrs
b
isabelle
smart
became
the
center
of
a
polite
yet
insistent
crush
of
satins
velvets
and
broadcloths
permeated
by
an
aroma
of
violets
and
a
gentle
hum
of
delicate
flattery
she
was
aware
of
a
timid
hand
upon
her
arm
and
turned
to
look
into
the
small
eager
face
under
the
unfashionable
bonnet
you
you
meant
religious
gifts
did
you
not
faltered
the
faint
discouraged
voice
faith
hope
and
and
the
the
being
resigned
to
god
s
will
and
and
endeavoring
to
bear
the
cross
i
meant
everything
that
you
want
answered
the
bright
eyed
one
with
deliberate
emphasis
the
bright
eyes
softening
as
they
took
in
more
completely
the
pinched
outlines
and
the
eager
child
s
look
shining
from
out
the
worn
and
faded
woman
s
face
but
but
there
is
so
much
i
i
never
had
anything
that
i
really
wanted
things
you
know
that
one
could
hardly
mention
in
one
s
prayers
have
them
now
have
them
all
god
is
all
all
is
god
you
are
god
s
god
is
yours
then
the
billowing
surges
of
silk
and
velvet
swept
the
small
inquiring
face
into
the
background
with
the
accustomed
ease
and
relentlessness
of
billowing
surges
having
partaken
copiously
of
certain
material
beliefs
consisting
of
salads
and
sandwiches
accompanied
by
divers
cups
of
strong
coffee
mrs
j
mortimer
van
deuser
had
become
pleasantly
flushed
and
expansive
a
most
unique
comprehensive
and
uplifting
view
of
our
spiritual
environment
she
remarked
to
miss
philura
her
best
society
smile
still
lingered
blandly
about
the
curves
and
creases
of
her
stolid
high
colored
visage
the
dying
violets
on
her
massive
satin
bosom
gave
forth
their
sweetest
parting
breath
the
little
lady
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
sat
very
erect
red
spots
glowed
upon
her
faded
cheeks
i
think
she
said
tremulously
that
it
was
just
wonderful
i
i
am
so
very
happy
to
have
heard
it
thank
you
a
thousand
times
dear
cousin
maria
for
taking
me
mrs
van
deuser
raised
her
gold
rimmed
glasses
and
settled
them
under
arching
brows
while
the
society
smile
faded
quite
away
of
course
she
said
coldly
one
should
make
due
and
proper
allowance
for
facts
as
they
exist
and
also
er
consider
above
all
what
interpretation
is
best
suited
to
one
s
individual
station
in
life
truth
my
dear
philura
adapts
itself
freely
to
the
needs
of
the
poor
and
lowly
as
well
as
to
the
demands
and
position
our
dear
master
himself
spoke
of
the
poor
as
always
with
us
you
will
remember
a
lowly
but
pious
life
passed
in
humble
recognition
of
god
s
chastening
providence
is
doubtless
good
and
proper
for
many
worthy
persons
miss
philura
s
blue
eyes
flashed
rebelliously
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
uncounted
years
she
made
no
answer
as
for
the
long
and
presumably
instructive
homily
on
the
duties
and
prerogatives
of
the
lowly
lasting
quite
up
to
the
moment
when
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
door
of
mrs
van
deuser
s
residence
it
fell
upon
ears
which
heard
not
indeed
her
next
remark
was
so
entirely
irrelevant
that
her
august
kinswoman
stared
in
displeased
amazement
i
am
going
to
purchase
some
some
necessaries
to
morrow
cousin
maria
i
should
like
fifine
to
go
with
me
miss
philura
acknowledged
to
herself
with
a
truthfulness
which
she
felt
to
be
almost
brazen
that
her
uppermost
yearnings
were
of
a
wholly
mundane
character
during
a
desires
by
bedtime
she
had
even
ventured
with
the
aid
of
a
stubbed
lead
pencil
to
indite
the
most
immediate
and
urgent
of
these
wants
as
they
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
consciousness
the
list
hidden
guiltily
away
in
the
depths
of
her
shabby
purse
read
something
as
follows
i
wish
to
be
beautiful
and
admired
i
want
two
new
dresses
a
hat
with
plumes
and
a
silk
petticoat
that
rustles
i
want
some
new
kid
gloves
and
a
feather
boa
a
long
one
made
of
ostrich
feathers
i
wish
the
small
blunt
pencil
had
been
lifted
in
air
for
the
space
of
three
minutes
before
it
again
descended
then
with
cheeks
that
burned
miss
philura
had
written
the
fateful
words
i
wish
to
have
a
lover
and
to
be
married
there
i
have
done
it
she
said
to
herself
her
little
fingers
trembling
with
agitation
he
must
already
exist
in
the
encircling
good
he
is
mine
moment
to
lay
this
singular
memorandum
before
her
maker
appeared
to
miss
philura
little
short
of
sacrilegious
but
the
thought
of
the
mysterious
abundance
of
which
the
seeress
had
spoken
urging
itself
as
it
were
upon
her
acceptance
encouraged
her
she
arose
from
her
evening
orisons
with
a
glowing
face
i
have
asked
she
said
aloud
and
i
believe
i
shall
have
mademoiselle
fifine
passed
a
very
enjoyable
morning
with
miss
philura
nt
know
the
usual
thing
that
she
d
only
wanted
to
prove
she
was
his
wife
on
the
child
s
account
that
she
d
never
wanted
his
money
hinton
said
she
was
very
quiet
not
in
the
least
excited
but
she
sent
back
the
cheque
kate
sat
motionless
her
head
bent
her
hands
clasped
about
her
knees
she
no
longer
looked
at
peyton
could
there
have
been
a
mistake
she
asked
slowly
a
mistake
she
raised
her
head
now
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
with
a
strange
insistence
of
observation
courts
did
nt
think
so
could
the
courts
have
been
mistaken
he
started
up
again
and
threw
himself
into
another
chair
good
god
kate
we
gave
her
every
chance
to
prove
her
case
why
did
nt
she
do
it
you
do
nt
know
what
you
re
talking
about
such
things
are
kept
from
girls
why
whenever
a
man
of
arthur
s
kind
dies
such
such
women
turn
up
there
are
lawyers
who
live
on
such
jobs
ask
your
father
about
it
of
course
this
woman
expected
to
be
bought
off
but
if
she
would
nt
take
your
money
she
expected
a
big
sum
i
mean
to
drop
the
case
when
she
found
we
meant
to
fight
it
she
saw
the
game
was
up
i
suppose
it
was
her
last
throw
and
she
was
desperate
we
do
nt
know
how
many
times
she
may
have
been
through
the
same
thing
before
that
kind
of
woman
is
always
man
who
who
has
been
about
with
them
kate
received
this
in
silence
she
had
a
sense
of
walking
along
a
narrow
ledge
of
consciousness
above
a
sheer
hallucinating
depth
into
which
she
dared
not
look
but
the
depth
drew
her
and
she
plunged
one
terrified
glance
into
it
but
the
child
the
child
was
arthur
s
peyton
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
again
how
can
we
tell
why
i
do
nt
suppose
the
woman
herself
i
wish
to
heaven
your
father
were
here
to
explain
she
rose
and
crossed
over
to
him
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
almost
maternal
do
nt
let
us
talk
of
it
she
said
you
did
all
you
could
think
what
a
comfort
you
were
to
poor
arthur
he
let
her
hands
lie
where
she
had
placed
them
without
response
or
resistance
i
tried
i
tried
hard
to
keep
him
straight
we
all
know
that
every
was
what
a
difference
it
made
to
him
in
the
end
it
would
have
been
dreadful
to
think
of
his
dying
out
there
alone
she
drew
him
down
on
a
sofa
and
seated
herself
by
his
side
a
deep
lassitude
was
upon
him
and
the
hand
she
had
possessed
herself
of
lay
in
her
hold
inert
it
was
splendid
of
you
to
travel
day
and
night
as
you
did
and
then
that
dreadful
week
before
he
died
but
for
you
he
would
have
died
alone
among
strangers
he
sat
silent
his
head
dropping
forward
his
eyes
fixed
among
strangers
he
repeated
absently
she
looked
up
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
that
poor
woman
did
you
ever
see
her
while
you
were
out
there
he
drew
his
hand
away
and
gathered
his
brows
together
as
if
in
an
effort
of
remembrance
i
saw
her
oh
yes
i
saw
her
he
pushed
the
tumbled
hair
from
his
forehead
and
he
said
my
head
is
in
a
fog
i
want
to
get
away
from
it
all
a
wave
of
compunction
drew
her
to
her
feet
it
was
my
fault
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
so
many
questions
she
turned
and
rang
the
bell
i
ll
order
the
ponies
we
shall
have
time
for
a
drive
before
sunset
ii
with
the
sunset
in
their
faces
they
swept
through
the
keen
scented
autumn
air
at
the
swiftest
pace
of
kate
s
ponies
she
had
given
the
reins
to
peyton
and
he
had
turned
the
horses
heads
away
from
the
lake
rising
by
woody
upland
lanes
to
the
high
pastures
which
still
held
the
sunlight
the
horses
were
fresh
enough
to
claim
his
undivided
attention
and
he
drove
in
silence
his
smooth
fair
profile
turned
to
his
companion
who
sat
silent
also
kate
orme
was
engaged
in
one
of
those
rapid
mental
excursions
which
were
forever
sweeping
her
from
the
straight
path
of
the
actual
into
uncharted
regions
of
conjecture
the
tendency
to
seek
out
ultimate
relations
to
extend
her
researches
to
the
limit
of
her
imaginative
experience
but
hitherto
she
had
been
like
some
young
captive
brought
up
in
a
windowless
palace
whose
painted
walls
she
takes
for
the
actual
world
now
the
palace
had
been
shaken
to
its
base
and
through
a
cleft
in
the
walls
she
looked
out
upon
life
for
the
first
moment
all
was
indistinguishable
blackness
then
she
began
to
detect
vague
shapes
and
confused
gestures
in
the
depths
there
were
people
below
there
men
like
denis
girls
like
herself
for
under
the
unlikeness
she
felt
the
strange
affinity
all
struggling
in
that
awful
coil
of
moral
darkness
with
agonized
hands
reaching
up
for
rescue
her
heart
shrank
from
the
horror
of
it
and
then
in
a
passion
of
pity
drew
back
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
suddenly
her
eyes
turned
toward
denis
his
face
was
grave
but
less
disturbed
and
men
knew
about
these
things
they
carried
this
abyss
in
their
bosoms
of
innocence
could
it
be
that
denis
denis
even
ah
no
she
remembered
what
he
had
been
to
poor
arthur
she
understood
now
the
vague
allusions
to
what
he
had
tried
to
do
for
his
brother
he
had
seen
arthur
down
there
in
that
coiling
blackness
and
had
leaned
over
and
tried
to
drag
him
out
but
arthur
was
too
deep
down
and
his
arms
were
interlocked
with
other
arms
they
had
dragged
each
other
deeper
poor
souls
like
drowning
people
who
fight
together
in
the
waves
kate
s
visualizing
habit
gave
a
hateful
precision
and
persistency
to
the
image
she
had
evoked
har
she
said
opening
a
closet
door
i
ve
brung
food
fer
you
uns
so
yer
wo

an

knowed

you
are
more
than
thoughtful
miss
kenyon
yer
seem
ter
have
fergot
what
we
agreed
ter
call
each
other
frank
she
spoke
the
words
in
a
tone
of
reproach
kate
barney
turned
away
winking
uselessly
at
nothing
at
all
and
kept
his
back
toward
them
for
some
moments
but
frank
merriwell
had
no
thought
of
making
love
to
to
be
his
friend
she
had
proved
herself
his
friend
and
as
no
more
than
a
friend
did
he
propose
to
accept
her
that
he
had
awakened
something
stronger
than
a
friendly
feeling
in
kate
kenyon
s
breast
seemed
evident
and
the
girl
was
so
artless
that
she
could
not
conceal
her
true
feelings
toward
him
they
stood
there
talking
in
a
low
tone
while
the
morning
light
stole
in
at
one
broken
window
and
grew
stronger
and
stronger
within
that
room
frank
was
studying
kate
s
speech
and
voice
as
he
did
so
a
new
thought
came
to
him
a
thought
that
was
at
first
a
mere
suspicion
which
he
scarcely
noted
at
all
this
suspicion
grew
and
he
found
himself
asking
kate
are
you
sure
your
brother
is
still
wearing
a
convict
s
suit
she
started
and
looked
at
him
closely
sure
o
it
she
repeated
no
fer
he
may
be
dead
you
do
not
know
that
he
is
dead
you
have
is
he
bold
and
daring
her
eyes
flashed
and
a
look
of
pride
swept
across
her
face
folks
always
lowed
rufe
kenyon
wa
nt
afeard
o
ary
two
legged
critter
livin
an
they
war
right
perhaps
he

she
clutched
his
arm
beginning
to
pant
as
she
asked
what
makes
you
say
that
i
knowed
he
d
try
it
some
day
but
but
have
you
heard
anything
do
you
know
that
he
has
tried
it
the
suspicion
leaped
to
a
conviction
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
if
rufe
kenyon
was
not
at
liberty
then
he
must
be
right
in
what
he
thought
i
do
not
know
that
your
brother
has
tried
to
escape
i
do
not
know
anything
about
him
i
did
think
that
he
might
be
muriel
the
moonshiner
kate
laughed
you
uns
war
plumb
mistooken
thar
she
said
positively
rufe
is
not
muriel
then
kate
kenyon
seemed
astounded
have
you
uns
gone
plumb
dafty
asked
the
girl
in
a
dazed
way
me
muriel
wal
that
beats
all
but
you
are
i
am
sure
of
it
said
frank
swiftly
the
girl
laughed
well
that
beats
me
of
course
i
m
not
muriel
but
he
s
ther
best
friend
i
ve
got
in
these
maountings
frank
was
far
from
satisfied
but
he
was
too
courteous
to
insist
after
this
denial
kate
laughed
the
idea
to
scorn
saying
over
and
over
that
the
boy
must
be
dafty
but
still
his
mind
was
unchanged
to
be
sure
there
were
some
things
not
easily
explained
one
being
how
muriel
concealed
her
luxurious
red
hair
for
muriel
s
hair
appeared
to
be
coal
black
another
thing
was
that
wade
miller
must
know
muriel
and
kate
were
one
and
the
same
and
yet
he
preserved
her
secret
and
allowed
her
to
snatch
his
victims
from
his
maws
words
the
irish
youth
was
struck
dumb
when
he
could
collect
himself
he
softly
muttered
well
av
all
th
oideas
thot
takes
th
cake
having
seen
them
safely
within
the
mill
and
shown
them
the
food
brought
there
kate
said

is
two
revolvers

cried
barney
as
he
grasped
one
of
the
weapons
let
thim
come

declared
frank
next
time
wade

frankie
kate
bade
them
good
by
assuring
them
that
she
would
return
with
the
coming
of
another
night
and
making
them
promise
to
await
her
and
then
she
flitted
away
slipped
out
of
the
mill
soon
vanishing
amid
ter
be

frankie
observed
barney
i
quite

with
you
laughed
merriwell
this

a
black
and
tempestuous
one
but
we
have
lived
through
it
and
i
do
not
believe

find
ourselves
in
such
peril
again
while
we
are
in
the
tennessee
mountains
they
were
hungry
and
they
ate
heartily
of
the
plain
food
that
had
been
provided
for
them
when
breakfast

over

i
have
thought
of
those
things
and
i
have
wondered
how
she
concealed
that
mass
of
red
hair
still
i
am
satisfied
she
does
it
well
it
s
no
use
to
talk
to
you
at
all
at
all
however
they
did
discuss
it
for
some
time
to
save
time
you
are
to
go
right
to
the
person
who
ordered
it
without
stopping
to
change
your
clothes
you
can
do
that
there
it
will
make
her
late
to
the
ball
at
best
a
carriage
and
a
person
to
magnificent
dress
that
was
gradually
built
upon
the
figure
of
clarissa
and
when
at
last
it
was
completed
and
she
stood
before
the
great
pier
glass
flushed
with
the
radiance
of
a
pleasure
she
could
not
but
feel
despite
her
late
sorrow
and
the
fact
she
was
but
the
lay
figure
for
a
more
fortunate
woman
one
would
have
to
search
far
to
find
a
more
beautiful
creature
whyee
exclaimed
mrs
mcguffin
why
i
had
no
idea
you
had
such
a
figure
why
i
must
have
you
in
my
department
to
show
off
dresses
on
you
will
work
at
the
cutlery
counter
not
a
day
after
to
morrow
but
there
i
am
keeping
you
the
ball
must
almost
have
begun
here
s
a
bag
with
your
things
in
it
i
was
going
to
say
your
other
things
and
throwing
a
splendid
cloak
about
the
lovely
shoulders
of
miss
clarissa
mrs
mcguffin
turned
her
over
to
the
messenger
there
was
already
somebody
in
the
carriage
into
which
clarissa
stepped
window
she
was
unable
to
even
conjecture
the
sex
of
the
individual
who
was
to
be
her
conductor
to
her
destination
and
steeped
in
dreams
which
from
pleasant
ones
quickly
passed
to
bitter
she
speedily
forgot
all
about
the
person
at
her
side
but
presently
she
perceived
their
carriage
had
come
into
the
midst
of
a
squadron
of
other
carriages
charging
down
upon
a
brilliantly
lighted
entrance
where
men
and
women
brave
in
evening
dress
were
moving
in
why
we
are
going
to
the
ball
room
itself
and
as
she
said
this
and
realized
that
here
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
entrancing
gayeties
she
was
to
put
off
her
fine
plumage
and
see
the
other
woman
pass
out
of
the
dressing
room
into
the
delights
beyond
while
she
crept
away
in
her
own
simple
garb
amid
the
questioning
amused
and
contemptuous
stares
of
the
haughty
dames
who
had
witnessed
the
exchange
she
broke
into
a
piteous
sob
why
of
course
to
the
ball
room
my
darling
breathed
a
voice
which
low
of
an
archangel
and
she
felt
herself
strained
to
a
man
s
heart
and
her
bare
shoulders
which
peeped
from
the
cloak
at
the
thrust
of
a
pair
of
strong
arms
beneath
it
came
in
contact
with
the
cool
smooth
surface
of
the
bosom
of
a
dress
shirt
do
nt
you
remember
that
i
engaged
the
second
two
step
at
the
charity
ball
clarissa
almost
swooning
with
joy
as
she
reclined
palpitating
upon
the
manly
breast
of
captain
william
leadbury
said
never
a
word
for
the
power
of
speech
was
not
in
her
the
power
of
song
of
uttering
peans
of
joy
perhaps
but
not
the
power
of
speech
have
i
assumed
too
much
said
leadbury
gravely
relaxing
somewhat
the
tightness
of
his
embrace
have
i
arguing
from
the
fact
that
you
both
served
me
in
the
crisis
of
my
career
and
saved
my
life
assumed
too
much
in
believing
you
love
me
if
so
i
beg
your
pardon
for
arranging
this
surprise
i
no
crooned
clarissa
nestling
against
him
with
all
the
quivering
protest
of
a
child
about
to
be
taken
from
its
mother
you
read
my
actions
rightly
oh
how
i
have
suffered
this
week
no
word
from
you
i
could
not
understand
it
of
course
you
could
not
know
i
was
a
girl
but
i
thought
you
ought
to
be
grateful
even
to
a
boy
but
i
did
know
you
were
a
girl
when
you
fell
i
began
to
open
the
clothes
about
your
chest
when
i
discovered
your
sex
i
carried
you
upstairs
placed
you
on
a
bed
threw
a
blanket
over
you
and
was
about
to
call
miss
bording
to
take
charge
of
you
i
m
glad
you
did
nt
i
do
nt
like
miss
bording
said
clarissa
i
had
left
to
call
her
when
that
poltroon
of
an
anderson
walkley
who
had
stolen
back
into
the
house
after
running
from
it
crept
behind
me
and
i
dropped
unconscious
in
the
resulting
confusion
your
very
existence
was
as
forgotten
as
your
whereabouts
was
unknown
you
lay
there
as
i
had
left
you
until
a
maid
found
you
in
the
morning
and
packed
you
off
it
was
not
until
wednesday
that
i
was
able
to
be
out
i
knew
you
came
from
this
store
and
mousing
about
in
there
i
had
no
trouble
in
identifying
the
nice
young
page
with
the
beautiful
young
woman
at
the
cutlery
counter
i
could
scarce
wait
two
days
but
as
three
had
already
passed
i
planned
this
surprise
remembering
our
banter
when
i
talked
with
you
disguised
as
a
man
of
fifty
and
now
you
are
to
go
in
with
me
as
my
affianced
bride
we
d
better
hurry
for
the
driver
must
be
wondering
what
we
are
thinking
about
it
was
worthy
of
remark
that
even
the
ladies
passed
many
compliments
upon
the
beauty
and
grace
of
miss
clarissa
dawson
the
young
woman
who
came
to
the
ball
with
william
leadbury
heir
to
the
millions
of
the
late
james
leadbury
and
a
number
of
persons
esteemed
judges
of
all
that
pertains
to
the
terpsichorean
art
declared
that
when
she
appeared
upon
the
floor
for
the
first
time
which
was
to
dance
the
second
two
step
with
the
gallant
soldier
that
such
was
the
surpassing
grace
with
which
she
revolved
over
the
floor
that
one
might
well
say
she
seemed
to
be
dancing
upon
air
what
befell
mr
middleton
because
of
the
sixth
gift
of
the
emir
it
is
strange
said
mr
middleton
that
after
clarissa
had
shown
her
devotion
to
the
extent
of
saving
his
life
captain
leadbury
could
have
had
even
for
a
moment
any
misgivings
that
she
loved
him
one
can
not
always
be
sure
said
were
limping
and
staggering
mercedes
was
riding
the
loaded
sled
hal
guided
at
the
gee
pole
and
charles
stumbled
along
in
the
rear
as
buck
watched
them
thornton
knelt
beside
him
and
with
rough
kindly
hands
searched
for
broken
bones
by
the
time
his
search
had
disclosed
nothing
more
than
many
bruises
and
a
state
of
terrible
starvation
the
sled
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
dog
and
man
watched
it
crawling
along
over
the
ice
suddenly
they
saw
its
back
end
drop
down
as
into
a
rut
and
the
gee
pole
with
hal
clinging
to
it
jerk
into
the
air
mercedes
s
scream
came
to
their
ears
they
saw
charles
turn
and
make
one
step
to
run
back
and
then
a
whole
section
of
ice
give
way
and
dogs
and
humans
disappear
a
yawning
hole
was
all
that
was
to
be
seen
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
of
the
trail
john
thornton
and
said
john
thornton
and
buck
licked
his
hand
chapter
vi
for
the
love
of
a
man
when
john
thornton
froze
his
feet
in
the
previous
december
his
partners
had
made
him
comfortable
and
left
him
to
get
well
going
on
themselves
up
the
river
to
get
out
a
raft
of
saw
logs
for
dawson
he
was
still
limping
slightly
at
the
time
he
rescued
buck
but
with
the
continued
warm
weather
even
the
slight
limp
left
him
and
here
lying
by
the
river
bank
through
the
long
spring
days
watching
the
running
water
listening
lazily
to
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
hum
of
nature
buck
slowly
won
back
his
strength
a
rest
comes
very
good
after
one
has
travelled
three
thousand
miles
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
buck
waxed
lazy
as
his
wounds
healed
his
muscles
swelled
out
and
the
flesh
came
back
to
cover
his
bones
for
that
matter
they
were
all
loafing
buck
john
thornton
and
skeet
and
nig
waiting
for
the
raft
to
come
was
a
little
irish
setter
who
early
made
friends
with
buck
who
in
a
dying
condition
was
unable
to
resent
her
first
advances
she
had
the
doctor
trait
which
some
dogs
possess
and
as
a
mother
cat
washes
her
kittens
so
she
washed
and
cleansed
buck
s
wounds
regularly
each
morning
after
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
she
performed
her
self
appointed
task
till
he
came
to
look
for
her
ministrations
as
much
as
he
did
for
thornton
s
nig
equally
friendly
though
less
demonstrative
was
a
huge
black
dog
half
bloodhound
and
half
deerhound
with
eyes
that
laughed
and
a
boundless
good
nature
to
buck
s
surprise
these
dogs
manifested
no
jealousy
toward
him
they
seemed
to
share
the
kindliness
and
largeness
of
john
thornton
as
buck
grew
stronger
they
enticed
him
into
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
games
in
which
thornton
himself
could
not
forbear
to
join
and
in
this
fashion
buck
romped
through
his
convalescence
and
into
a
new
existence
love
genuine
passionate
love
was
his
at
judge
miller
s
down
in
the
sun
kissed
santa
clara
valley
with
the
judge
s
sons
hunting
and
tramping
it
had
been
a
working
partnership
with
the
judge
s
grandsons
a
sort
of
pompous
guardianship
and
with
the
judge
himself
a
stately
and
dignified
friendship
but
love
that
was
feverish
and
burning
that
was
adoration
that
was
madness
it
had
taken
john
thornton
to
arouse
this
man
had
saved
his
life
which
was
something
but
further
he
was
the
ideal
master
other
men
saw
to
the
welfare
of
their
dogs
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
business
expediency
he
saw
to
the
welfare
of
his
as
if
they
were
his
own
children
because
he
could
not
help
it
and
he
saw
further
he
never
forgot
a
kindly
greeting
or
a
cheering
word
and
to
sit
down
for
a
long
talk
with
them
gas
he
called
it
was
as
much
his
delight
as
theirs
he
had
a
way
of
taking
buck
s
head
roughly
between
s
of
shaking
him
back
and
forth
the
while
calling
him
ill
names
that
to
buck
were
love
names
buck
knew
no
greater
joy
than
that
rough
embrace
and
the
sound
of
murmured
oaths
and
at
each
jerk
back
and
forth
it
seemed
that
his
heart
would
be
shaken
out
of
his
body
so
great
was
its
ecstasy
and
when
released
he
sprang
to
his
feet
his
mouth
laughing
his
eyes
eloquent
his
throat
vibrant
with
unuttered
sound
and
in
that
fashion
remained
without
movement
john
thornton
would
reverently
exclaim
god
you
can
all
but
speak
buck
had
a
trick
of
love
expression
that
was
akin
to
hurt
he
would
often
seize
thornton
s
hand
in
his
mouth
and
close
so
fiercely
that
the
flesh
bore
the
impress
of
his
teeth
for
some
time
afterward
and
as
buck
understood
the
oaths
to
be
love
words
so
the
man
understood
this
feigned
bite
for
a
caress
for
the
most
part
however
buck
s
love
was
expressed
in
adoration
or
spoke
to
him
he
did
not
seek
these
tokens
unlike
skeet
who
was
wont
to
shove
her
nose
under
thornton
s
hand
and
nudge
and
nudge
till
petted
or
nig
who
would
stalk
up
and
rest
his
great
head
on
thornton
s
knee
buck
was
content
to
adore
at
a
distance
he
would
lie
by
the
hour
eager
alert
at
thornton
s
feet
looking
up
into
his
face
dwelling
upon
it
studying
it
following
with
keenest
interest
each
fleeting
expression
every
movement
or
change
of
feature
or
as
chance
might
have
it
he
would
lie
farther
away
to
the
side
or
rear
watching
the
outlines
of
the
man
and
the
occasional
movements
of
his
body
and
often
such
was
the
communion
in
which
they
lived
the
strength
of
buck
s
gaze
would
draw
john
thornton
s
head
around
and
he
would
return
the
gaze
without
speech
his
heart
shining
out
of
his
eyes
as
buck
s
heart
shone
out
for
a
long
time
get
out
of
his
sight
from
the
moment
he
left
the
tent
little
garden
was
bright
and
full
of
leaves
and
flowers
it
s
life
she
said
to
judith
judith
nodded
and
smiled
back
at
her
understanding
quite
well
just
as
she
had
understood
the
eyes
of
the
bird
who
had
swung
on
the
twig
so
near
her
cheek
the
day
she
had
hidden
among
the
bushes
in
the
park
now
you
must
go
the
little
girl
said
at
last
and
judith
went
out
of
the
room
at
once
without
waiting
or
looking
back
though
she
knew
the
white
figure
did
not
stir
till
she
was
out
of
sight
it
was
not
until
she
had
reached
the
second
floor
that
the
change
came
upon
her
it
was
a
great
change
and
a
curious
one
the
closed
room
became
as
far
away
as
all
other
places
and
things
had
seemed
when
she
had
stood
upon
the
roof
feeling
the
nearness
of
the
blueness
and
the
white
clouds
as
when
she
had
looked
round
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
child
in
the
closed
room
she
knew
that
she
had
heard
no
voice
when
the
little
girl
spoke
to
her
she
knew
that
it
had
happened
that
it
was
she
only
who
had
lifted
the
doll
who
had
taken
out
the
toys
who
had
arranged
the
low
table
for
their
feast
putting
all
the
small
service
upon
it
and
though
they
had
played
with
such
rapturous
enjoyment
and
had
laughed
and
feasted
what
had
they
feasted
on
that
she
could
not
recall
and
not
once
had
she
touched
or
been
touched
by
the
light
hand
or
white
dress
and
though
they
seemed
to
express
their
thoughts
and
intentions
freely
she
had
heard
no
voice
at
all
she
was
suddenly
bewildered
and
stood
rubbing
her
hand
over
her
forehead
and
her
eyes
but
she
was
happy
as
happy
as
when
she
had
fallen
awake
in
her
sleep
and
was
no
more
troubled
or
really
curious
than
she
would
have
been
if
she
had
had
the
same
experience
every
day
of
her
life
well
you
must
have
been
having
a
good
time
playing
up
stairs
jane
foster
said
when
she
entered
the
big
kitchen
this
is
going
to
do
a
day
in
the
country
do
nt
she
jem
through
the
weeks
that
followed
her
habit
of
playing
up
stairs
was
accepted
as
a
perfectly
natural
thing
no
questions
were
asked
and
she
knew
it
was
not
necessary
to
enter
into
any
explanations
every
day
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
closed
room
and
finding
it
closed
at
a
touch
of
her
hand
upon
the
panel
it
swung
softly
open
there
she
waited
sometimes
for
a
longer
sometimes
for
a
shorter
time
and
the
child
with
the
coppery
hair
came
to
her
the
world
below
was
gone
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
and
through
the
hours
they
played
together
joyously
as
happy
children
play
but
in
their
playing
it
was
always
judith
who
touched
the
toys
who
held
the
doll
who
set
the
little
table
for
their
feast
once
as
she
went
down
stairs
she
remembered
that
when
she
had
that
day
made
a
wreath
of
roses
from
the
roof
and
had
gone
to
put
it
on
her
playmate
s
head
she
had
drawn
back
with
deepened
dimple
laughing
no
do
not
touch
me
but
there
was
no
mystery
in
it
after
all
judith
knew
she
should
presently
understand
she
was
so
happy
that
her
happiness
lived
in
her
face
in
a
sort
of
delicate
brilliance
jane
foster
observed
the
change
in
her
with
exceeding
comfort
her
view
being
that
spacious
quarters
fresh
air
and
sounder
sleep
had
done
great
things
for
her
them
big
eyes
of
hers
ai
nt
like
no
other
child
s
eyes
i
ve
ever
seen
she
said
to
her
husband
with
cheerful
self
gratulation
an
her
skin
s
that
fine
an
thin
an
fair
you
can
jest
see
through
it
she
always
looks
to
me
as
if
she
was
made
out
of
different
stuff
from
me
an
you
jem
i
ve
always
said
it
she
s
going
to
make
a
corking
handsome
girl
responded
jem
with
a
chuckle
they
had
been
in
the
house
two
months
when
one
afternoon
as
she
was
slicing
child
standing
at
the
kitchen
doorway
looking
with
a
puzzled
expression
at
some
wilted
flowers
she
held
in
her
hand
jane
s
impression
was
that
she
had
been
coming
into
the
room
and
had
stopped
suddenly
to
look
at
what
she
held
what
ve
you
got
there
judy
she
asked
they
re
flowers
said
judith
her
eyes
still
more
puzzled
where
d
you
get
em
from
i
did
nt
know
you
d
been
out
i
thought
you
was
up
stairs
i
was
said
judith
quite
simply
in
the
closed
room
jane
foster
s
knife
dropped
into
her
pan
with
a
splash
well
she
gasped
judith
looked
at
her
with
quiet
eyes
the
closed
room
jane
cried
out
what
are
you
saying
you
could
nt
get
in
yes
i
can
jane
was
conscious
of
experiencing
a
shock
she
said
afterwards
that
suddenly
something
gave
her
the
creeps
persisted
i
tried
it
again
yesterday
as
i
passed
by
turned
the
handle
and
gave
it
a
regular
shove
and
it
would
nt
give
an
inch
yes
the
child
answered
i
heard
you
we
were
inside
then
a
few
days
later
when
jane
weepingly
related
the
incident
to
awe
stricken
and
sympathizing
friends
she
described
as
graphically
as
her
limited
vocabulary
would
allow
her
to
do
so
the
look
in
judith
s
face
as
she
came
nearer
to
her
do
nt
tell
me
there
was
nothing
happening
then
she
said
she
just
came
up
to
me
with
them
dead
flowers
in
her
hand
an
a
kind
of
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
was
half
sorry
for
me
an
did
nt
know
quite
why
the
door
opens
for
me
she
says
that
s
where
i
play
every
day
there
s
a
little
girl
comes
and
plays
with
cause
of
their
happiness
appeared
indeed
the
gray
old
miner
was
at
dennihan
s
already
keno
had
met
him
on
the
hill
with
an
eager
cry
that
welcome
softened
by
the
news
and
appeal
miss
doc
herself
came
running
to
the
gate
her
hungry
arms
outstretched
to
take
the
child
just
make
him
well
was
jim
s
one
cry
i
know
a
woman
can
make
him
well
and
all
afternoon
the
men
at
the
blacksmith
s
shop
kept
up
their
hope
keno
had
come
to
them
telling
of
the
altered
plans
by
which
little
skeezucks
had
found
his
way
to
miss
doc
but
by
special
instruction
he
added
that
jim
was
certain
that
improvement
was
coming
already
he
told
me
that
evenin
is
the
customary
hour
fer
to
have
a
tree
anyhow
concluded
keno
hopefully
he
says
he
was
off
when
he
said
to
turn
it
loose
at
noon
does
he
think
miss
doc
can
git
the
little
feller
fixed
all
up
to
celebrate
to
night
inquired
bone
is
that
the
bill
of
fare
that
s
about
it
said
keno
importantly
i
m
to
come
impatient
for
the
night
to
arrive
excited
anew
when
at
last
it
closed
in
on
the
world
of
snow
and
mountains
the
celebrators
once
more
gathered
at
the
shop
and
lighted
up
their
tree
the
wind
was
rushing
brusquely
up
the
street
the
snow
began
once
more
to
fall
from
the
palace
saloon
came
the
sounds
of
music
laughter
song
and
revelry
light
streamed
forth
from
the
window
in
glowing
invitation
all
day
long
its
flow
of
steaming
drinks
and
its
endless
succession
of
savory
dishes
had
laded
the
air
with
temptation
not
a
few
of
the
citizens
of
borealis
had
succumbed
to
the
gayer
attractions
of
parky
s
festival
but
the
men
who
had
builded
a
christmas
tree
and
loaded
its
branches
with
presents
waited
and
waited
for
tiny
skeezucks
in
the
dingy
shop
the
evening
passed
night
aged
in
the
way
that
wintry
storm
and
lowering
skies
compel
dismally
creaked
the
door
on
its
rusted
hinges
into
the
chink
shot
the
particles
of
snow
and
formed
again
that
icy
mark
the
candles
burned
away
on
the
tree
gave
a
gasp
a
flare
and
expired
silently
loyally
the
group
of
big
rough
miners
and
toilers
sat
in
the
cheerless
gloom
hearing
that
music
in
its
soullessness
come
on
the
gusts
of
the
storm
waiting
waiting
for
their
tiny
guest
at
length
a
single
candle
alone
illumined
their
pitiful
tree
standing
with
its
meagre
branches
of
greenery
stiffly
upheld
on
its
scrawny
frame
while
the
darkness
closed
sombrely
in
upon
the
glint
of
the
toys
they
had
labored
to
make
then
finally
keno
came
downcast
pale
and
worried
the
little
feller
s
awful
sick
he
said
i
guess
he
ca
nt
come
to
the
tree
his
statement
was
greeted
in
silence
then
maybe
he
ll
see
it
to
morrow
said
the
blacksmith
after
a
moment
it
would
nt
make
so
very
much
odds
to
us
old
cusses
christmas
is
for
kids
of
course
so
we
ll
leave
her
standing
their
final
hopes
slowly
they
all
went
out
in
the
storm
and
night
shutting
the
door
on
the
christmas
celebration
now
abandoned
to
darkness
the
creak
of
the
hinges
the
long
line
of
snow
inside
that
pointed
to
the
tree
one
by
one
they
bade
good
night
to
webber
the
smith
and
so
went
home
to
many
a
cold
little
cabin
seemingly
hunched
like
a
freezing
thing
in
the
driving
storm
chapter
xiv
if
only
i
had
the
resolution
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
the
tiny
bit
of
a
man
at
miss
doc
s
seemed
neither
to
be
worse
nor
better
of
his
ailment
the
hand
of
lethargy
lay
with
dulling
weight
upon
him
old
jim
and
miss
dennihan
were
baffled
though
their
tenderness
increased
and
their
old
animosity
disappeared
forgotten
in
the
stress
of
care
that
the
sister
of
doc
could
develop
such
a
spirit
of
motherhood
astounded
nearly
every
man
in
the
camp
accustomed
to
acerbities
of
criticism
for
their
many
shortcomings
from
her
ever
pointed
tongue
they
marvelled
the
more
population
of
the
town
she
had
scorned
and
verbally
castigated
most
frequently
resupplying
their
tree
with
candles
the
patient
fellows
had
kept
alive
their
hope
of
a
great
day
of
joy
and
celebration
only
to
see
it
steadily
receding
from
their
view
at
length
they
decided
to
carry
their
presents
to
the
house
where
the
wan
little
foundling
lay
trusting
the
sight
of
their
labors
of
love
might
cheer
him
to
recovery
to
the
utter
amazement
of
her
brother
miss
doc
not
only
permitted
the
big
rough
men
to
track
the
snow
through
her
house
when
they
came
with
their
gifts
but
she
gave
them
kindly
welcome
in
her
face
that
day
they
readily
saw
some
faint
illusive
sign
of
beauty
heretofore
unnoticed
or
perhaps
concealed
he
ll
come
along
all
right
she
told
them
with
a
smile
they
found
to
be
singularly
sweet
for
jim
do
seem
a
comfort
to
the
poor
little
thing
old
jim
would
surely
have
been
glad
to
believe
that
he
or
anything
supplied
quietly
in
bed
the
miner
sat
by
him
all
day
long
and
far
into
every
night
only
climbing
to
his
cabin
on
the
hill
when
necessity
drove
him
away
then
he
was
back
there
in
the
morning
by
daylight
eager
but
cheerful
always
the
presents
were
heaped
on
the
floor
in
sight
of
the
pale
little
skeezucks
who
clung
unfailingly
through
it
all
to
the
funny
makeshift
of
a
doll
that
bruvver
jim
had
placed
in
his
keeping
he
appeared
not
at
all
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
gifts
the
men
had
brought
or
to
know
their
purpose
that
never
a
genuinely
happy
christmas
had
brightened
his
little
mysterious
life
miss
dennihan
knew
by
a
swift
keen
process
of
womanly
intuition
i
wisht

nt
so
sad

to

that

they

are
also
really
very
sorry
for
this
mistake
i
enclose
you
the
letter
which
i
received
from
them
in
regard
to
this
can
you
not
see
that
they
regret
this
sincerely
can
you
not
even
hear
the
wail
that
our
office
man
must
have
uttered
when
he
dictated
the
letter
now
morris
i
really
know
that
my
firm
holds
you
in
high
esteem
and
why
should
they
not
you
have
always
patronized
them
liberally
you
have
always
paid
your
bills
and
you
have
never
made
yourself
ugly
toward
them
in
any
way
as
i
say
there
is
no
excuse
for
this
mistake
but
if
you
are
willing
to
pass
that
all
up
morris
i
am
sure
you
would
very
happy
indeed
if
you
would
merely
wire
the
house
ship
my
goods
as
originally
ordered
and
after
all
morris
think
this
thing
over
and
maybe
you
will
conclude
that
t
is
better
far
to
bear
the
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
ca
nt

you

some
men
like
that
said
a
hat
man
friend
who
sat
with
us
but
i
struck
one
old
bluffer
out
in
south
dakota
once
that
would
nt
stand
for
any
smoothing
over
business
with
i
ever
saw
he
was
all
right
to
talk
fishing
and
politics
with
and
was
a
good
entertainer
he
always
treated
me
decently
in
that
way
but
when
it
got
down
to
business
he
was
the
meanest
son
of
a
gun
on
earth
a
fishing
trip
for
half
an
hour
or
the
political
situation
during
luncheon
is
a
pretty
good
thing
to
talk
over
but
when
it
comes
to
interfering
with
business
i
think
it
is
about
time
to
cut
it
out
my
house
had
been
selling
this
man
for
several
years
he
handled
a
whole
lot
of
goods
but
it
worried
the
life
out
of
me
to
get
his
bill
last
time
i
did
business
with
him
he
had
monkeyed
with
me
all
day
long
and
i
had
struck
him
as
many
as
four
times
to
go
over
to
my
sample
room
if
he
had
made
a
positive
engagement
and
said
that
he
would
see
me
at
twelve
o
clock
that
night
it
would
have
been
all
right
but
he
would
turn
away
with
not
even
giving
me
the
satisfaction
of
saying
he
did
nt
want
anything
at
all
i
felt
that
i
d
spent
time
enough
in
the
town
so
after
supper
i
brought
over
a
bunch
of
soft
hats
under
my
arm
and
about
nine
o
clock
he
looked
at
them
picked
out
a
few
numbers
and
said
he
had
to
go
to
lodge
i
boned
him
about
straw
hats
i
was
on
my
spring
trip
then
look
at
them
to
morrow
he
grunted
i
was
beginning
to
get
tired
of
this
sort
of
she
seemed
no
longer
conscious
he
withdrew
to
his
cave
in
great
perplexity
and
distress
next
day
she
made
many
observations
which
alas
strengthened
her
fears
she
saw
that
the
banks
were
too
dry
and
that
the
grass
on
the
shore
and
the
trailing
plants
on
the
rocks
were
withering
away
she
caused
marks
to
be
made
along
the
borders
and
examined
them
day
after
day
in
all
directions
of
the
wind
till
at
last
the
horrible
idea
became
a
certain
fact
that
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
slowly
sinking
the
poor
princess
nearly
went
out
of
the
little
mind
she
had
it
was
awful
to
her
to
see
the
lake
which
she
loved
more
than
any
living
thing
lie
dying
before
her
eyes
it
sank
away
slowly
vanishing
the
tops
of
rocks
that
had
never
been
seen
till
now
began
to
appear
far
down
in
the
clear
water
before
long
they
were
dry
in
the
sun
it
was
fearful
to
and
festering
full
of
lovely
creatures
dying
and
ugly
creatures
coming
to
life
like
the
unmaking
of
a
world
and
how
hot
the
sun
would
be
without
any
lake
she
could
not
bear
to
swim
in
it
any
more
and
began
to
pine
away
her
life
seemed
bound
up
with
it
and
ever
as
the
lake
sank
she
pined
people
said
she
would
not
live
an
hour
after
the
lake
was
gone
but
she
never
cried
proclamation
was
made
to
all
the
kingdom
that
whosoever
should
discover
the
cause
of
the
lake
s
decrease
would
be
rewarded
after
a
princely
fashion
hum
drum
and
kopy
keck
applied
themselves
to
their
physics
and
metaphysics
but
in
vain
not
even
they
could
suggest
a
cause
now
the
fact
was
that
the
old
princess
was
at
the
root
of
the
mischief
when
she
heard
that
her
niece
found
more
pleasure
in
the
water
than
any
one
else
had
out
of
it
she
went
into
a
rage
and
cursed
herself
for
her
want
of
foresight
soon
set
all
right
the
king
and
the
people
shall
die
of
thirst
their
brains
shall
boil
and
frizzle
in
their
skulls
before
i
will
lose
my
revenge
and
she
laughed
a
ferocious
laugh
that
made
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
her
black
cat
stand
erect
with
terror
then
she
went
to
an
old
chest
in
the
room
and
opening
it
took
out
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
dried
seaweed
this
she
threw
into
a
tub
of
water
then
she
threw
some
powder
into
the
water
and
stirred
it
with
her
bare
arm
muttering
over
it
words
of
hideous
sound
and
yet
more
hideous
import
then
she
set
the
tub
aside
and
took
from
the
chest
a
huge
bunch
of
a
hundred
rusty
keys
that
clattered
in
her
shaking
hands
then
she
sat
down
and
proceeded
to
oil
them
all
before
she
had
finished
out
from
the
tub
the
water
of
which
had
kept
on
a
slow
motion
ever
since
she
had
ceased
stirring
it
came
the
head
but
the
witch
did
not
look
round
it
grew
out
of
the
tub
waving
itself
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
slow
horizontal
motion
till
it
reached
the
princess
when
it
laid
its
head
upon
her
shoulder
and
gave
a
low
hiss
in
her
ear
she
started
but
with
joy
and
seeing
the
head
resting
on
her
shoulder
drew
it
towards
her
and
kissed
it
then
she
drew
it
all
out
of
the
tub
and
wound
it
round
her
body
it
was
one
of
those
dreadful
creatures
which
few
have
ever
beheld
the
white
snakes
of
darkness
then
she
took
the
keys
and
went
down
to
her
cellar
and
as
she
unlocked
the
door
she
said
to
herself
this
is
worth
living
for
locking
the
door
behind
her
she
descended
a
few
steps
into
the
cellar
and
crossing
it
unlocked
another
door
into
a
dark
narrow
passage
she
locked
this
also
behind
her
and
descended
a
few
more
steps
if
any
one
had
followed
the
witch
princess
he
would
have
a
few
steps
after
unlocking
each
when
she
had
unlocked
the
last
she
entered
a
vast
cave
the
roof
of
which
was
supported
by
huge
natural
pillars
of
rock
now
this
roof
was
the
under
side
of
the
bottom
of
the
lake
she
then
untwined
the
snake
from
her
body
and
held
it
by
the
tail
high
above
her
the
hideous
creature
stretched
up
its
head
towards
the
roof
of
the
cavern
which
it
was
just
able
to
reach
it
then
began
to
move
its
head
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
slow
oscillating
motion
as
if
looking
for
something
at
the
same
moment
the
witch
began
to
walk
round
and
round
the
cavern
coming
nearer
to
the
centre
every
circuit
while
the
head
of
the
snake
described
the
same
path
over
the
roof
that
she
did
over
the
floor
for
she
kept
holding
it
up
and
still
it
kept
slowly
osculating
round
and
round
the
cavern
they
went
ever
lessening
the
circuit
till
at
last
the
snake
made
a
sudden
dart
that
s
right
my
beauty
cried
the
princess
drain
it
dry
she
let
it
go
left
it
hanging
and
sat
down
on
a
great
stone
with
her
black
cat
which
had
followed
her
all
round
the
cave
by
her
side
then
she
began
to
knit
and
mutter
awful
words
the
snake
hung
like
a
huge
leech
sucking
at
the
stone
the
cat
stood
with
his
back
arched
and
his
tail
like
a
piece
of
cable
looking
up
at
the
snake
and
the
old
woman
sat
and
knitted
and
muttered
seven
days
and
seven
nights
they
remained
thus
when
suddenly
the
serpent
dropped
from
the
roof
as
if
exhausted
and
shrivelled
up
till
it
was
again
like
a
piece
of
dried
seaweed
the
witch
started
to
her
feet
picked
it
up
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
looked
up
at
the
roof
one
drop
of
water
was
trembling
on
the
spot
where
the
snake
had
been
sucking
as
my
name
is
lew
flapp
i
m
looking
for
a
fellow
was
the
name
dan
baxter
had
assumed
for
the
time
being
it
s
all
right
old
woman
tell
him
to
come
in
said
a
voice
from
inside
the
cottage
and
lew
flapp
entered
the
house
immediately
the
old
woman
closed
the
door
after
him
and
barred
it

and

plot
mischief
the
cottage
which
mother
matterson
occupied
was
a
much
dilapidated
one
of
a
story
and
a
half
containing
three
rooms
and
a
loft
some
of
the
windows
were
broken
out
and
the
chimney
was
sadly
in
need
of
repair
many
were
the
rumors
afloat
concerning
this
old
woman
some
said
she
was
little
short
of
being
a
witch
while
others
had
it
that
she
was
in
league
with
tramps
who
had
stolen
things
for
miles
around
but
so
far
if
guilty
she
had
escaped
the
penalty
of
the
law
so
you
ve
come
at
last
went
on
the
person
in
the
cottage
as
lew
flapp
came
in
and
a
moment
later
dan
baxter
came
old
with
a
sour
look
on
his
face
and
several
scars
which
made
him
particularly
repulsive
i
had
almost
given
you
up
i
ve
had
my
own
troubles
getting
here
answered
flapp
at
first
i
could
nt
locate
hacknack
and
then
i
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
with
sam
rover
sam
rover
is
he
on
your
track
now
i
rather
guess
not
and
the
bully
of
putnam
hall
gave
a
short
laugh
he
has
gone
swimming
for
his
health
what
do
you
mean
i
ll
tell
you
answered
lew
flapp
and
in
a
rapid
manner
he
related
all
that
had
occurred
since
he
had
met
sam
in
the
oak
run
barber
shop
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
are
a
lucky
dog
came
from
dan
baxter
at
the
conclusion
of
the
recital
you
can
thank
your
stars
that
you
are
not
at
this
moment
in
the
oak
run
lock
up
all
if
it
had
nt
been
for
you
growled
flapp
oh
do
nt
come
any
such
game
on
me
flapp
i
can
read
you
like
a
book
you
know
you
do
nt
dare
to
go
home
after
that
trip
up
at
white
corners
your
old
man
would
just
about
kill
you
and
you
d
be
locked
up
in
the
bargain
at
these
words
lew
flapp
winced
for
he
knew
that
dan
baxter
spoke
the
truth
he
was
afraid
to
go
home
and
had
come
to
hacknack
simply
because
he
knew
not
where
else
to
go
and
because
baxter
had
promised
him
some
money
the
amount
he
had
realized
on
the
sale
of
the
stolen
jewelry
had
been
spent
see
here
what
s
the
use
of
talking
that
way
he
grumbled
i
did
nt
come
here
to
get
a
lecture
i
m
not
lecturing
you
came
hastily
from
dan
baxter
i
m
merely
telling
you
things
for
your
own
good
flapp
i
want
you
along
swimmingly
you
said
you
d
let
me
have
some
money
and
i
ll
keep
my
word
i
need
at
least
fifty
dollars
you
ll
need
more
than
that
flapp
you
ve
got
to
stay
away
from
home
until
this
matter
blows
over
or
until
your
old
man
patches
things
up
with
that
aaron
fairchild
and
the
white
corners
authorities
i
ve
got
a
plan
if
you
care
to
listen
to
it
sure
i
ll
listen
if
you
ll
only
let
me
have
that
money
i
ll
let
you
have
all
you
want
providing
you
ll
agree
to
help
me
well
what
is
your
plan
but
first
tell
me
how
about
this
woman
and
flapp
nodded
his
head
toward
mother
matterson
do
nt
you
worry
about
her
grinned
dan
baxter
i
ve
got
her
fixed
she
wo
nt
squeal
then
go
ahead
as
i
said
before
the
home
until
this
unpleasantness
blows
over
write
to
your
father
and
tell
him
it
is
all
a
mistake
and
that
you
are
not
guilty
but
that
you
ca
nt
prove
it
ask
him
to
square
the
thing
with
aaron
fairchild
and
the
others
and
tell
him
you
are
going
on
an
ocean
trip
and
wo
nt
be
back
until
you
know
you
are
safe
then
you
come
with
me
and
we
ll
have
a
jolly
good
time
besides
squaring
up
matters
with
the
rovers
where
are
you
going
and
how
are
you
going
to
square
matters
with
them
i
ve
learned
a
thing
or
two
since
i
came
here
at
first
i
was
going
to
try
to
fix
them
while
they
were
at
home
but
now
i
ve
learned
that
they
are
going
away
on
a
houseboat
trip
on
the
ohio
and
the
mississippi
i
propose
to
follow
them
and
give
them
more
than
they
want
the
first
opportunity
that
presents
itself
you
are
certain
about
this
houseboat
trip
i
the
three
rover
boys
and
some
of
their
school
chums
humph
i
d
like
to
get
square
with
the
whole
crowd
muttered
lew
flapp
i
d
like
to
sink
them
in
the
middle
of
the
ohio
river
we
ll
square
up
do
nt
you
worry
answered
dan
baxter
i
m
not
forgetting
all
they
ve
done
against
me
in
the
past
if
i
had
the
chance
i
d
wring
the
neck
of
every
one
of
them
he
added
fiercely
i
do
nt
think
it
is
safe
to
stay
around
here
any
longer
said
lew
flapp
after
a
pause
somebody
may
spot
us
both
i
m
not
going
to
stay
any
longer
we
can
get
out
on
the
night
train
by
the
way
supposing
sam
rover
does
nt
get
out
of
the
river
what
do
you
mean
questioned
flapp
with
a
shiver
although
he
knew
well
enough
maybe
sam
say
that
bah
do
nt
be
chicken
hearted
flapp
i
i
did
nt
mean
to
to
kill
him
i
know
you
did
nt
just
the
same
that
is
a
dangerous
river
the
current
is
swift
and
it
s
full
of
face
regarded
him
with
natural
indifference
and
looked
out
of
the
window
forgetting
him
a
few
moments
later
accidentally
aware
of
him
again
she
carelessly
noted
his
superficially
attractive
qualities
and
approving
resumed
her
idle
inspection
of
the
passing
round
she
found
him
looking
rather
fixedly
at
her
and
involuntarily
she
returned
the
gaze
with
a
childlike
directness
a
gaze
which
he
sustained
to
the
limit
of
good
breeding
then
evaded
so
amiably
that
it
left
an
impression
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
i
do
nt
see
thought
aphrodite
why
i
never
meet
that
sort
of
man
he
has
nt
art
nouveau
legs
and
his
features
are
not
by
products
of
his
hair
i
have
told
my
brothers
in
law
that
i
am
old
enough
to
go
out
without
coming
out
and
i
am
the
lovely
mouth
grew
sullen
again
i
do
nt
wish
to
wait
two
years
and
be
what
dreadful
newspapers
call
a
bud
i
wish
to
go
to
dinners
and
dances
now
where
i
ll
meet
that
sort
of
man
the
sort
one
feels
almost
at
liberty
to
talk
to
without
anybody
presenting
anybody
i
ve
a
mind
to
look
amiable
the
next
time
he
he
raised
his
eyes
at
that
instant
but
that
is
the
effect
of
civilization
on
me
she
reflected
metropolitan
civilization
i
felt
like
saying
for
goodness
sake
let
s
say
something
even
in
spite
of
all
my
sisters
have
told
me
i
ca
nt
see
why
it
would
be
dangerous
for
me
to
look
amiable
if
he
glances
at
me
again
so
agreeably
he
did
but
she
did
nt
smile
you
see
she
said
accusing
herself
discontentedly
you
do
nt
dare
look
human
why
because
you
ve
had
it
so
drummed
into
you
that
you
can
never
never
again
do
anything
natural
why
oh
because
they
all
begin
to
talk
about
mysterious
dangers
when
you
say
you
wish
to
be
natural
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
to
look
interested
the
next
time
he
turns
why
should
nt
he
see
that
i
m
quite
willing
to
talk
to
him
and
i
m
so
tired
of
looking
out
of
the
window
before
i
came
to
anybody
who
attracted
me
and
i
m
not
now
so
if
he
does
look
at
me
he
did
the
faintest
glimmer
of
a
smile
troubled
her
lips
she
thought
i
do
wish
he
d
speak
there
was
a
very
becoming
color
in
his
face
partly
because
he
was
experienced
enough
not
to
mistake
her
partly
from
a
sudden
and
complete
realization
of
her
beauty
it
s
so
odd
thought
aphrodite
that
attractive
people
consider
it
dangerous
to
speak
to
one
another
i
do
nt
see
any
danger
i
wonder
what
he
has
in
that
square
box
beside
him
it
ca
nt
be
a
camera
it
ca
nt
be
a
folding
easel
it
simply
ca
nt
be
that
he
is
an
artist
a
man
like
that
are
you
she
asked
quite
involuntarily
what
he
replied
astonished
wheeling
around
an
an
artist
i
ca
nt
believe
it
and
i
do
you
know
for
a
moment
he
could
scarcely
realize
that
she
had
spoken
his
keen
gaze
dissected
the
face
before
him
the
unembarrassed
eyes
the
oval
contour
the
smooth
flawless
loveliness
of
a
child
yes
i
am
an
artist
he
said
considering
her
curiously
i
am
sorry
she
said
no
not
sorry
only
unpleasantly
surprised
you
see
i
am
so
tired
of
art
and
i
thought
you
looked
so
so
wholesome
he
began
to
laugh
a
modulated
laugh
rather
infectious
too
for
aphrodite
bit
her
lip
then
smiled
not
exactly
understanding
it
all
why
do
you
laugh
she
asked
still
smiling
have
i
said
something
i
should
not
have
said
but
he
replied
with
a
question
have
you
found
art
unwholesome
i
i
do
nt
know
she
answered
with
a
little
sigh
i
am
so
tired
of
it
all
you
it
is
nt
often
i
talk
about
it
he
said
laughing
again
oh
that
is
unusual
why
do
nt
you
talk
about
art
i
m
much
too
busy
d
doing
what
if
that
is
not
very
impertinent
oh
making
pictures
of
things
he
said
intensely
amused
pictures
you
do
nt
talk
about
art
and
you
paint
pictures
yes
w
what
kind
do
you
mind
my
asking
you
are
so
so
very
unusual
well
to
earn
my
living
i
make
full
page
pictures
for
magazines
to
satisfy
an
absurd
desire
i
paint
people
things
anything
that
might
satisfy
my
color
senses
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
gaily
you
see
i
m
the
sort
you
are
so
tired
of
but
you
paint
the
artists
i
know
do
nt
paint
except
that
way
she
the
air
and
before
she
had
achieved
it
they
were
both
convulsed
with
laughter
you
never
do
that
do
you
she
asked
at
length
no
i
never
do
i
ca
nt
afford
to
decorate
the
atmosphere
for
nothing
then
then
you
are
not
interested
in
art
nouveau
no
and
i
never
could
see
that
beautiful
music
resembled
frozen
architecture
they
were
laughing
again
looking
with
confidence
what
is
a
necklace
of
precious
tones
she
asked
precious
stones
no
tones
let
me
cite
as
an
example
those
beautiful
verses
of
henry
haynes
he
replied
gravely
to
be
or
not
to
be
i
d
rather
be
a
could
be
if
i
can
not
be
an
are
for
a
could
be
is
a
may
be
with
a
chance
of
touching
par
i
had
rather
be
a
has
been
than
a
might
have
been
by
far
for
a
was
once
an
are
also
an
are
is
is
and
am
a
was
was
all
of
these
so
i
d
rather
be
a
has
been
than
a
has
nt
if
you
please
and
they
fell
a
laughing
so
shamelessly
that
the
bus
driver
turned
and
squinted
through
his
shutter
at
them
and
the
scandalized
horses
stopped
of
their
own
accord
are
you
going
to
leave
he
asked
as
she
rose
yes
this
is
the
park
she
said
greatly
puzzled
me
during
the
first
days
of
my
residence
in
the
rested
upon
all
at
first
it
appeared
to
be
connected
wholly
with
direction
the
horde
feared
the
northeast
it
lived
in
perpetual
apprehension
of
that
quarter
of
the
compass
and
every
individual
gazed
more
frequently
and
with
greater
alarm
in
that
direction
than
in
any
other
when
lop
ear
and
i
went
toward
the
north
east
to
eat
the
stringy
rooted
carrots
that
at
that
season
were
at
their
best
he
became
unusually
timid
he
was
content
to
eat
the
leavings
the
big
tough
carrots
and
the
little
ropy
ones
rather
than
to
venture
a
short
distance
farther
on
to
where
the
carrots
were
as
yet
untouched
when
i
so
ventured
he
scolded
me
and
quarrelled
with
me
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
in
that
direction
was
some
horrible
danger
but
just
what
the
horrible
danger
was
his
paucity
of
language
would
not
permit
him
to
say
many
a
good
meal
i
got
in
this
fashion
while
he
scolded
and
chattered
vainly
at
me
i
could
not
understand
i
kept
very
alert
but
i
could
myself
and
the
nearest
tree
and
knew
that
to
that
haven
of
refuge
i
could
out
foot
the
tawny
one
or
old
saber
tooth
did
one
or
the
other
suddenly
appear
one
late
afternoon
in
the
village
a
great
uproar
arose
the
horde
was
animated
with
a
single
emotion
that
of
fear
the
bluff
side
swarmed
with
the
folk
all
gazing
and
pointing
into
the
northeast
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
but
i
scrambled
all
the
way
up
to
the
safety
of
my
own
high
little
cave
before
ever
i
turned
around
to
see
and
then
across
the
river
away
into
the
northeast
i
saw
for
the
first
time
the
mystery
of
smoke
it
was
the
biggest
animal
i
had
ever
seen
i
thought
it
was
a
monster
snake
up
ended
rearing
its
head
high
above
the
trees
and
swaying
back
and
forth
and
yet
somehow
i
seemed
to
gather
from
the
conduct
of
the
folk
that
the
smoke
itself
was
not
the
danger
they
appeared
to
fear
it
else
was
i
was
unable
to
guess
nor
could
they
tell
me
yet
i
was
soon
to
know
and
i
was
to
know
it
as
a
thing
more
terrible
than
the
tawny
one
than
old
saber
tooth
than
the
snakes
themselves
than
which
it
seemed
there
could
be
no
things
more
terrible
chapter
vii
broken
tooth
was
another
youngster
who
lived
by
himself
his
mother
lived
in
the
caves
but
two
more
children
had
come
after
him
and
he
had
been
thrust
out
to
shift
for
himself
we
had
witnessed
the
performance
during
the
several
preceding
days
and
it
had
given
us
no
little
glee
broken
tooth
did
not
want
to
go
and
every
time
his
mother
left
the
cave
he
sneaked
back
into
it
when
she
returned
and
found
him
there
her
rages
were
delightful
half
the
horde
made
a
practice
of
watching
for
these
moments
first
from
within
the
cave
would
come
her
scolding
and
shrieking
then
we
could
hear
sounds
of
the
thrashing
and
the
yelling
of
broken
tooth
about
this
time
like
the
eruption
of
a
miniature
volcano
broken
tooth
would
come
flying
out
at
the
end
of
several
days
his
leaving
home
was
accomplished
he
wailed
his
grief
unheeded
from
the
centre
of
the
open
space
for
at
least
half
an
hour
and
then
came
to
live
with
lop
ear
and
me
our
cave
was
small
but
with
squeezing
there
was
room
for
three
i
have
no
recollection
of
broken
tooth
spending
more
than
one
night
with
us
so
the
accident
must
have
happened
right
away
it
came
in
the
middle
of
the
day
in
the
morning
we
had
eaten
our
fill
of
the
carrots
and
then
made
heedless
by
play
we
had
ventured
on
to
the
big
trees
just
beyond
i
can
not
understand
how
lop
ear
got
over
his
habitual
caution
but
it
must
have
been
the
play
we
were
having
a
great
time
playing
tree
tag
and
such
tag
we
leaped
ten
or
fifteen
foot
gaps
as
a
matter
of
course
and
a
twenty
or
twenty
five
foot
deliberate
drop
clear
down
i
am
almost
afraid
to
say
the
great
distances
we
dropped
as
we
grew
older
and
heavier
we
found
we
had
to
be
more
cautious
in
dropping
but
at
that
age
our
bodies
were
all
strings
and
springs
and
we
could
do
anything
broken
tooth
displayed
remarkable
agility
in
the
game
he
was
it
less
frequently
than
any
of
us
and
in
the
course
of
the
game
he
discovered
one
difficult
slip
that
neither
lop
ear
nor
i
was
able
to
accomplish
to
be
truthful
we
were
afraid
to
attempt
it
when
we
were
it
broken
tooth
always
ran
out
to
the
end
of
a
lofty
branch
in
a
certain
tree
from
the
end
of
the
branch
to
the
ground
it
must
have
been
seventy
feet
and
nothing
intervened
to
break
a
fall
but
about
twenty
feet
lower
down
and
fully
fifteen
feet
out
from
the
perpendicular
was
the
thick
branch
of
another
tree
as
we
ran
out
the
limb
broken
tooth
facing
us
would
begin
teetering
this
naturally
teetering
than
that
he
teetered
with
his
back
to
the
jump
he
was
to
make
just
as
we
nearly
reached
him
he
would
let
go
the
teetering
branch
was
like
a
spring
board
it
threw
him
far
out
backward
as
he
fell
and
as
he
fell
he
turned
around
sidewise
in
the
air
so
as
to
face
the
other
branch
into
which
he
was
falling
this
branch
bent
far
down
under
the
impact
and
sometimes
there
was
an
ominous
crackling
but
it
never
broke
and
out
of
the
leaves
was
always
to
be
seen
the
face
of
broken
tooth
grinning
triumphantly
up
at
us
i
was
it
the
last
time
broken
tooth
tried
this
he
had
gained
the
end
of
the
branch
cumberland
and
it
is
now
your
right
to
claim
and
receive
from
the
hands
of
the
queen
of
love
and
beauty
the
chaplet
of
honor
which
your
skill
has
justly
deserved

cumberland
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
steps
with
a
slouching
gait
and
looking
about
him
right
and
left
the
blight
blushing
prettily
took
the
chaplet
and
went
down
the
steps
to
meet
him
unmask
i
shouted
yes
son
said
the
hon
sam
take
that
rag
off
then
mollie
s
voice
clear
and
loud
startled
the
crowd
you
better
not
dave
branham
fer
if
you
do
and
this
other
gal
puts
that
thing
on
you
you
ll
never
what
penalty
she
was
going
to
inflict
i
do
nt
know
for
the
knight
of
the
cumberland
half
kneeling
sprang
suddenly
to
his
feet
and
interrupted
her
wait
a
minute
will
ye
he
said
almost
fiercely
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
mollie
rose
to
her
feet
and
her
face
blanched
lord
god
she
said
almost
in
anguish
and
then
she
dropped
quickly
to
her
seat
again
the
knight
of
the
cumberland
had
gone
back
to
his
horse
as
he
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
as
the
black
horse
sprang
toward
the
opening
tore
his
mask
from
his
face
turned
in
his
stirrups
and
brandished
his
spear
with
a
yell
of
defiance
while
a
dozen
voices
shouted
the
wild
dog
then
was
there
an
uproar
goddle
mighty
shouted
the
hon
sam
i
did
nt
do
it
i
swear
i
did
nt
know
it
he
s
tricked
me
he
s
tricked
me
do
nt
shoot
you
might
hit
that
hoss
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
hon
sam
s
innocence
instead
of
turning
over
an
outlaw
to
the
police
he
had
brought
him
into
the
inner
shrine
of
law
and
order
and
he
knew
what
a
political
asset
for
his
enemies
that
insult
would
be
and
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
innocence
of
mollie
and
buck
as
they
stood
mollie
wringing
her
hands
and
buck
with
open
mouth
and
startled
face
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
innocence
of
anybody
other
than
dave
branham
and
the
dare
devil
knight
dog
s
bridle
and
missed
and
the
outlaw
struck
savagely
at
him
with
his
spear
nobody
dared
to
shoot
because
of
the
scattering
crowd
but
every
knight
and
every
mounted
policeman
took
out
after
the
outlaw
and
the
beating
of
hoofs
pounded
over
the
little
mound
and
toward
poplar
hill
marston
ran
to
his
horse
at
the
upper
end
threw
his
saddle
on
and
hesitated
there
were
enough
after
the
wild
dog
and
his
horse
was
blown
he
listened
to
the
yells
and
sounds
of
the
chase
encircling
poplar
hill
the
outlaw
was
making
for
lee
all
at
once
the
yells
and
hoof
beats
seemed
to
sound
nearer
and
marston
listened
astonished
the
wild
dog
had
wheeled
and
was
coming
back
he
was
going
to
make
for
the
gap
where
sure
safety
lay
marston
buckled
his
girth
and
as
he
sprang
on
his
horse
unconsciously
taking
his
spear
with
him
the
wild
dog
dashed
from
the
trees
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
as
marston
started
the
wild
dog
saw
him
pulled
something
that
flashed
again
and
brandishing
his
spear
he
came
full
speed
and
yelling
up
the
middle
of
the
field
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
happen
in
these
modern
days
but
marston
was
an
officer
of
the
law
and
was
between
the
wild
dog
and
the
ford
and
liberty
through
the
gap
into
the
hills
the
wild
dog
was
an
outlaw
it
was
marston
s
duty
to
take
him
the
law
does
not
prescribe
with
what
weapon
the
lawless
shall
be
subdued
and
marston
s
spear
was
the
only
weapon
he
had
moreover
the
wild
dog
s
yell
was
a
challenge
that
set
his
blood
afire
and
the
girl
both
loved
was
looking
on
the
crowd
gathered
the
meaning
of
the
joust
the
knights
were
crashing
toward
each
other
with
spears
at
rest
there
were
a
few
surprised
oaths
from
men
a
few
low
cries
from
women
and
then
dead
silence
in
which
the
sound
of
hoofs
on
the
hard
turf
was
like
thunder
the
blight
s
face
was
white
and
the
little
sister
was
gripping
into
view
out
of
the
woods
at
tight
angles
to
stop
them
and
it
seemed
that
the
three
horses
must
crash
together
in
a
heap
with
a
moan
the
blight
buried
her
face
on
my
shoulder
she
shivered
when
the
muffled
thud
of
body
against
body
and
the
splintering
of
wood
rent
the
air
a
chorus
of
shrieks
arose
about
her
and
when
she
lifted
her
frightened
face
marston
the
discarded
was
limp
on
the
ground
his
horse
was
staggering
to
his
feet
and
the
wild
dog
was
galloping
past
her
his
helmet
gleaming
his
eyes
ablaze
his
teeth
set
the
handle
of
his
broken
spear
clinched
in
his
right
hand
and
blood
streaming
down
the
shoulder
of
the
black
horse
she
heard
the
shots
that
were
sent
after
him
she
heard
him
plunge
into
the
river
and
then
she
saw
and
heard
no
more
viii
the
knight
passes
a
telegram
summoned
the
blight
a
home
next
day
marston
was
in
bed
with
a
ragged
wound
in
the
shoulder
left
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
and
when
i
came
back
their
hands
were
unclasping
and
for
a
discarded
knight
the
engineer
surely
wore
a
happy
though
pallid
face
that
afternoon
the
train
on
which
we
left
the
gap
was
brought
to
a
sudden
halt
in
wildcat
valley
by
a
piece
of
red
flannel
tied
to
the
end
of
forbidden
things
and
her
son
without
sharing
her
simple
faith
in
their
omniscience
credited
them
with
an
ample
supply
of
the
kind
of
information
of
which
he
was
in
search
mrs
boykin
from
the
corner
of
an
intensely
modern
gobelin
sofa
studied
her
cousin
as
he
balanced
himself
insecurely
on
one
of
the
small
fanny
de
malrive
oh
of
course
i
remember
you
were
all
very
intimate
with
the
frisbees
when
they
lived
in
west
thirty
third
street
but
she
has
dropped
all
her
american
friends
since
her
marriage
the
excuse
was
that
de
malrive
did
nt
like
them
but
as
she
s
been
separated
for
five
or
six
years
i
ca
nt
see
you
say
she
s
been
very
nice
to
your
mother
and
the
girls
well
i
daresay
she
is
beginning
to
feel
the
need
of
friends
she
can
really
trust
for
as
for
her
french
relations
that
malrive
set
is
the
worst
in
the
faubourg
of
course
you
know
what
he
is
even
the
family
for
decency
s
sake
had
to
back
her
up
and
urge
her
to
get
a
separation
and
christiane
de
treymes
durham
seized
his
opportunity
is
she
so
very
reprehensible
too
mrs
boykin
pursed
up
her
small
colourless
mouth
i
ca
nt
speak
from
personal
experience
i
know
madame
de
treymes
fact
except
when
she
wants
me
to
go
to
one
of
her
ventes
de
charite
they
all
remember
us
then
and
some
american
women
are
silly
enough
to
ruin
themselves
at
the
smart
bazaars
and
fancy
they
will
get
invitations
in
return
they
say
mrs
addison
g
pack
followed
madame
d
alglade
around
for
a
whole
winter
and
spent
a
hundred
thousand
francs
at
her
stalls
and
at
the
end
of
the
season
madame
d
alglade
asked
her
to
tea
and
when
she
got
there
she
found
that
was
for
a
charity
too
and
she
had
to
pay
a
hundred
francs
to
get
in
mrs
boykin
paused
with
a
smile
of
compassion
that
is
not
my
way
she
continued
personally
i
have
no
desire
to
thrust
myself
into
french
society
i
ca
nt
see
how
any
american
woman
can
do
so
without
loss
of
self
respect
but
any
one
can
tell
you
about
madame
de
treymes
i
wish
you
would
then
durham
suggested
well
i
think
elmer
had
better
at
this
point
advanced
across
the
wide
expanse
of
aubusson
on
which
his
wife
and
durham
were
islanded
in
a
state
of
propinquity
without
privacy
what
s
that
bessy
hah
durham
how
are
you
did
nt
see
you
at
auteuil
this
afternoon
you
do
nt
race
busy
sight
seeing
i
suppose
what
was
that
my
wife
was
telling
you
oh
about
madame
de
treymes
he
stroked
his
pepper
and
salt
moustache
with
a
gesture
intended
rather
to
indicate
than
conceal
the
smile
of
experience
beneath
it
well
madame
de
treymes
has
not
been
like
a
happy
country
she
s
had
a
history
several
of
em
some
one
said
she
constituted
the
feuilleton
of
the
faubourg
daily
news
la
suite
au
prochain
numero
you
see
the
point
not
that
i
speak
from
personal
knowledge
bessy
and
i
have
never
cared
to
force
our
way
he
paused
reflecting
that
his
wife
had
probably
anticipated
him
in
the
expression
of
this
familiar
sentiment
and
added
with
a
significant
nod
no
i
m
surprised
at
that
well
he
s
one
of
the
choicest
ornaments
of
the
jockey
club
very
fascinating
to
the
ladies
i
believe
but
the
deuce
and
all
at
baccara
ruined
his
mother
and
a
couple
of
maiden
aunts
already
and
now
madame
de
treymes
has
put
the
family
pearls
up
the
spout
and
is
wearing
imitation
for
love
of
him
i
had
that
straight
from
my
maid
s
cousin
who
is
employed
by
madame
d
armillac
s
jeweller
said
mrs
boykin
with
conscious
pride
oh
it
s
straight
enough
more
than
she
is
retorted
her
husband
who
was
slightly
jealous
of
having
his
facts
reinforced
by
any
information
not
of
his
own
gleaning
be
careful
of
what
you
say
elmer
mrs
boykin
interposed
with
archness
i
suspect
john
of
being
seriously
smitten
by
the
lady
durham
let
this
pass
unchallenged
submitting
with
a
good
grace
to
his
host
s
low
whistle
of
amusement
and
the
sardonic
enquiry
they
call
over
here
a
fine
lame
oh
i
do
nt
mean
to
resort
to
bloodshed
unless
it
s
absolutely
necessary
but
i
mean
to
make
the
lady
s
acquaintance
said
durham
falling
into
his
key
mrs
boykin
s
lips
tightened
to
the
vanishing
point
i
am
afraid
you
must
apply
for
an
introduction
to
more
fashionable
people
than
we
are
elmer
and
i
so
thoroughly
disapprove
of
french
society
that
we
have
always
declined
to
take
any
part
in
it
but
why
should
not
fanny
de
malrive
arrange
a
meeting
for
you
durham
hesitated
i
do
nt
think
she
is
on
very
intimate
terms
with
her
husband
s
family
you
mean
that
she
s
not
allowed
to
introduce
her
friends
to
them
mrs
boykin
interjected
sarcastically
while
her
husband
added
with
an
air
of
portentous
initiation
ah
my
dear
fellow
the
way
they
treat
the
americans
over
here
that
s
another
chapter
you
know
how
some
people
can
stand
it
footman
entering
at
that
moment
tendered
her
a
large
coronetted
envelope
she
held
it
up
as
if
in
illustration
of
the
indignities
to
which
her
countrymen
were
subjected
look
at
that
my
dear
john
she
exclaimed
another
card
to
one
of
their
everlasting
bazaars
why
it
s
at
madame
d
armillac
s
the
prince
s
mother
madame
de
treymes
must
have
sent
it
of
course
the
brazen
way
in
which
they
combine
religion
and
immorality
fifty
francs
admission
rien
que
cela
to
see
some
of
the
most
disreputable
people
in
europe
and
if
you
re
an
american
you
re
expected
to
leave
at
least
a
thousand
behind
you
their
own
people
naturally
get
off
cheaper
she
tossed
over
the
card
to
her
cousin
there
s
your
it
was
shortly
after
ten
o
clock
one
morning
when
ezra
simpkins
a
reporter
from
the
boston
banner
entered
the
oriental
building
that
on
sixth
avenue
and
began
to
hunt
for
the
office
of
the
royal
society
of
egyptian
exploration
and
research
after
wandering
through
a
labyrinth
of
halls
he
finally
found
it
on
the
second
floor
a
few
steps
farther
on
a
stairway
led
down
to
one
of
the
side
entrances
for
the
building
could
be
entered
from
any
of
the
four
bounding
streets
simpkins
regarded
knocking
on
doors
and
sending
in
cards
as
formalities
which
served
merely
to
tempt
people
of
a
retiring
disposition
to
lie
so
when
he
walked
into
the
waiting
room
and
found
it
deserted
he
passed
through
it
quickly
and
opened
the
door
beyond
but
if
he
had
expected
this
manoeuver
to
bring
him
within
easy
distance
of
the
person
whom
he
was
seeking
he
was
disappointed
he
had
simply
walked
into
a
small
outer
office
a
self
sufficient
youth
of
twelve
who
was
stuffed
into
a
be
buttoned
suit
was
its
sole
occupant
hello
bub
said
simpkins
to
this
cerberus
of
the
threshold
mrs
athelstone
in
he
had
instantly
decided
to
use
it
in
place
of
a
card
as
being
more
likely
to
gain
him
admittance
aw
fergit
it
the
youth
answered
with
fine
american
independence
i
ll
let
youse
know
when
your
turn
comes
an
youse
can
keep
your
ref
rences
till
you
re
asked
for
em
and
he
surveyed
simpkins
with
marked
disfavor
the
reporter
made
no
answer
and
asked
no
questions
until
that
moment
he
had
not
known
that
he
had
a
turn
but
if
he
had
he
did
not
propose
to
lose
it
by
any
foolish
slip
so
he
settled
down
in
his
chair
and
began
to
turn
over
his
assignment
in
his
mind
that
simpkins
had
come
over
to
new
york
was
due
to
the
conviction
of
his
managing
editor
mr
naylor
that
a
certain
feature
which
had
been
shaping
up
in
his
head
would
possess
a
peculiar
interest
if
it
could
be
led
with
a
few
remarks
by
mrs
athelstone
though
her
husband
the
rev
alfred
w
r
interest
in
egyptology
had
led
him
to
accept
the
presidency
of
the
american
branch
of
the
royal
society
she
was
a
leader
among
the
theosophists
and
now
that
the
old
head
of
the
cult
was
dead
it
was
rumored
that
mrs
athelstone
had
announced
the
reincarnation
of
madame
blavatsky
in
her
own
person
this
in
itself
was
a
good
story
but
it
was
not
until
a
second
rumor
reached
naylor
s
ears
that
his
newspaper
soul
was
stirred
to
its
yellowest
depths
for
there
was
in
boston
an
association
known
as
the
american
society
for
the
investigation
of
ancient
beliefs
which
was
a
rival
of
the
royal
society
in
its
good
work
of
laying
bare
with
pick
and
spade
the
buried
mysteries
along
the
nile
and
this
rivalry
which
was
strong
between
the
societies
and
bitter
between
their
presidents
became
acute
in
the
persons
of
their
secretaries
both
of
whom
were
women
madame
gianclis
who
served
the
boston
society
boasted
egyptian
blood
in
her
veins
a
claim
which
mrs
athelstone
who
acted
as
with
the
qualification
that
some
ancestor
of
her
rival
had
contributed
a
dash
of
the
senegambian
as
well
illustration
aw
fergit
it
this
remark
duly
reported
to
madame
gianclis
had
not
put
her
in
a
humor
to
concede
madame
blavatsky
s
soul
or
any
part
of
it
to
mrs
athelstone
promptly
on
hearing
of
her
pretensions
so
rumor
had
it
the
boston
woman
had
announced
the
reincarnation
of
theosophy
s
high
priestess
in
herself
and
boston
believers
were
inclined
to
accept
her
view
as
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
understand
how
any
soul
with
liberty
of
action
could
deliberately
choose
a
new
york
residence
now
all
these
things
had
filtered
through
to
naylor
from
those
just
without
the
temple
gates
for
whatever
the
quarrels
of
the
two
societies
and
their
enemies
they
tried
to
keep
them
to
themselves
they
had
had
experience
with
publicity
and
had
found
that
ridicule
goes
hand
in
hand
with
it
in
this
iconoclastic
age
but
out
of
these
rumors
unconfirmed
though
vision
of
a
glorified
spread
in
the
sunday
banner
s
magazine
section
under
a
two
page
head
builded
cunningly
of
six
sizes
of
type
he
saw
ravishingly
beautiful
pictures
of
madame
gianclis
and
mrs
athelstone
and
hovering
between
them
the
materialized
but
homeless
soul
of
madame
blavatsky
trying
to
make
choice
of
an
abiding
place
the
whole
enlivened
and
illuminated
with
much
snappy
reading
matter
now
simpkins
was
the
man
to
make
a
managing
editor
s
dreams
come
true
so
naylor
rubbed
the
lamp
for
him
and
told
him
what
he
craved
but
the
reporter
s
success
in
life
had
been
won
by
an
ability
to
combine
much
extravagance
of
statement
in
the
written
with
great
conservatism
in
the
spoken
word
early
in
his
experience
he
had
learned
that
naylor
s
optimism
though
purely
professional
entailed
unpleasant
consequences
on
the
reporter
who
shared
it
and
then
betrayed
some
too
generous
trust
so
he
absolutely
refused
to
admit
that
there
was
any
basis
for
it
now
you
know
she
wo
nt
talk
york
boys
have
joshed
that
whole
bunch
so
they
re
afraid
to
say
their
prayers
out
loud
then
she
s
english
and
dead
swell
and
that
combination
s
hard
to
open
unless
you
have
a
number
in
the
four
hundred
and
then
it
ain
t
refined
to
try
i
can
make
a
pass
at
her
but
it
ll
be
a
frost
for
me
nonsense
you
must
make
her
talk
or
manage
to
be
around
while
some
one
else
does
naylor
answered
waving
aside
obstacles
with
the
noble
scorn
of
one
whose
business
it
is
to
set
others
to
conquer
them
i
want
a
good
snappy
interview
understand
and
descriptions
for
some
red
hot
pictures
if
you
can
t
get
photos
i
m
going
to
save
the
spread
in
meeting
of
two
friends
during
it
i
had
time
to
observe
the
king
he
wore
the
green
uniform
of
a
general
with
the
jewel
of
the
order
of
the
lion
around
his
neck
his
sixty
odd
years
sat
very
lightly
and
left
no
mark
save
in
the
facial
wrinkles
and
grey
hair
he
was
a
true
dalberg
in
height
and
general
appearance
and
with
the
strong
straight
nose
that
was
as
distinctive
to
our
family
as
was
the
beak
to
the
bourbons
i
had
remained
in
he
turned
and
presented
me
i
advanced
and
bowed
as
i
straightened
the
king
extended
his
hand
saying
we
are
glad
to
then
he
caught
a
full
view
of
my
face
and
stopped
staring
i
dropped
his
hand
and
stepped
back
and
for
a
space
no
one
moved
only
i
shot
a
side
glance
at
courtney
and
caught
a
half
smile
on
his
lips
then
frederick
recovered
himself
your
pardon
sir
but
i
did
not
catch
the
name
he
said
courtney
s
finesse
saved
me
the
embarrassment
of
a
self
introduction
major
dalberg
of
the
united
states
army
your
majesty
he
said
quickly
the
representative
of
our
war
department
with
your
army
dalberg
dalberg
he
muttered
then
added
perfunctorily
our
army
is
at
your
service
sir
though
i
fear
we
shall
be
unable
to
give
you
the
war
the
army
is
quite
enough
sire
i
began
he
was
studying
my
face
again
and
thinking
courtney
i
could
see
was
having
the
finest
sort
of
sport
i
could
have
throttled
him
you
have
our
name
major
said
the
king
may
i
ask
if
it
is
a
common
one
in
america
i
know
of
no
family
but
my
own
that
bears
it
there
i
answered
he
sat
down
and
motioned
for
us
to
do
likewise
i
am
interested
said
he
has
your
family
been
long
in
america
since
the
year
he
leaned
a
bit
forward
that
was
during
your
revolutionary
war
yes
your
majesty
it
was
that
year
lafayette
joined
washington
s
army
that
will
give
him
a
surprise
i
thought
it
did
do
you
know
the
name
of
the
dalberg
of
he
asked
quickly
i
saw
no
profit
in
evasion
he
was
hugo
second
son
of
henry
the
knew
it
he
exclaimed
jumping
up
and
coming
over
to
me
and
you
are
his
great
grandson
and
eldest
male
heir
then
as
such
i
salute
you
cousin
he
said
and
suddenly
kissed
me
on
the
cheek
were
you
ever
kissed
by
a
man
if
so
and
you
are
a
woman
it
doubtless
was
pleasant
enough
and
maybe
not
unusual
but
if
you
are
a
man
it
will
surprise
you
mightily
the
first
time
of
course
i
understood
all
the
significance
of
frederick
s
action
royalty
on
the
continent
so
greets
only
royalty
or
relatives
it
meant
i
was
accepted
as
one
of
the
blood
and
a
prince
of
my
house
i
admit
my
pride
was
stirred
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
i
said
bowing
again
i
expected
no
recognition
i
am
entitled
to
none
our
name
was
stricken
from
the
family
roll
he
made
a
deprecating
gesture
do
and
believe
me
also
i
had
no
intention
to
disclose
my
relationship
i
protested
the
king
laughed
you
could
not
hide
it
with
that
face
he
said
i
must
have
flushed
for
he
exclaimed
ha
you
know
that
do
you
for
answer
i
drew
out
the
miniature
of
old
henry
which
i
had
brought
hoping
for
an
opportunity
to
compare
it
with
the
original
and
handed
it
to
him
he
gave
it
a
quick
glance
and
nodded
yes
that
went
with
hugo
he
said
i
was
surprised
and
looked
it
oh
the
family
records
are
very
complete
as
to
the
affair
of
your
headstrong
ancestor
he
explained
old
henry
himself
set
it
all
out
in
his
journal
and
he
speaks
of
this
very
miniature
as
having
been
given
to
hugo
by
his
mother
the
day
he
left
dornlitz
there
were
two
of
them
copied
from
the
portrait
in
the
corridor
he
crossed
one
he
said
i
glanced
at
courtney
he
threw
up
his
hands
in
defeat
at
the
same
time
however
signifying
that
i
should
press
my
advantage
while
the
king
was
so
well
disposed
but
i
shook
my
head
my
descent
had
been
acknowledged
and
that
was
quite
enough
more
than
enough
indeed
i
had
come
to
valeria
as
a
major
in
the
american
army
i
sought
no
favors
from
the
dalbergs
here
from
which
it
would
seem
that
a
bit
of
hugo
s
stubborn
independence
had
come
down
to
me
as
for
courtney
the
shrug
of
his
shoulders
was
very
eloquent
of
what
he
thought
of
such
independence
perchance
you
never
heard
of
a
certain
letter
dispatched
to
hugo
by
his
brother
frederick
after
henry
s
death
the
king
asked
and
delivered
by
his
ambassador
i
supplemented
the
same
hugo
too
seems
to
have
kept
a
journal
he
kept
the
letter
itself
and
a
copy
of
his
altogether
hugo
must
have
been
a
rare
fine
fellow
with
a
mind
of
his
own
he
was
a
son
of
henry
the
third
i
answered
the
king
nodded
yet
t
was
a
pity
he
did
not
accept
frederick
s
offer
i
fancy
the
new
life
was
more
to
his
mind
doubtless
but
had
he
returned
it
would
be
you
and
not
ferdinand
of
lotzen
who
would
be
the
heir
presumptive
of
valeria
i
smiled
had
he
returned
i
would
not
be
i
true
enough
said
he
but
think
of
the
crown
of
your
ancestors
that
might
be
yours
it
is
enough
to
be
a
dalberg
i
have
never
thought
of
the
crown
i
answered
there
spoke
the
son
of
hugo
he
said
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
remember
that
we
were
not
alone
and
springing
up
he
sought
out
courtney
who
though
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
room
my
dear
courtney
he
exclaimed
i
have
been
unpardonably
rude
i
forgot
you
completely
yet
you
brought
it
on
yourself
you
called
the
girl
lazily
achilles
lifted
the
black
tube
the
child
beside
him
pressed
close
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
tube
achilles
s
words
ran
swift
on
the
wire
and
her
eager
face
held
them
other
words
came
back
sharp
swift
and
the
child
heard
them
crackle
and
leap
and
break
and
crackle
again
in
the
misty
depths
and
she
touched
achilles
s
arm
softly
they
must
not
hurt
mrs
seabury
she
said
you
tell
them
not
to
hurt
mrs
seabury
achilles
s
hand
pressed
her
shoulder
gently
yes
i
tell
they
know
it
was
a
swift
aside
and
his
voice
had
taken
up
the
tale
that
woman
you
not
take
that
woman
you
hear
yes
she
good
woman
tell
them
to
look
in
the
cellar
said
there
is
a
hole
there
under
a
barrel
and
a
barrel
in
the
garden
you
tell
them
his
eye
dropped
to
her
in
cellar
you
say
that
yes
yes
her
hands
were
clasped
they
took
me
there
you
tell
them
achilles
s
eye
smiled
hallo
you
look
in
cellar
what
you
say
no
i
do
nt
see
it
but
you
look
in
cellar
yes
they
make
tunnel
yes
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
took
her
hand
now
we
go
home
he
said
they
passed
swiftly
out
dropping
payment
into
a
sleepy
unseeing
palm
and
crossing
the
square
to
the
car
that
should
carry
them
home
there
were
no
delays
now
only
swift
running
wheels
a
few
jolts
and
stops
and
they
were
out
again
beneath
the
stars
hurrying
along
the
great
breakwater
of
the
lake
hurrying
home
the
big
thin
blackness
and
suddenly
as
they
looked
it
was
touched
lightly
as
with
a
great
finger
and
the
dawn
glowed
mistily
up
the
walls
they
crossed
swiftly
and
mounted
the
steps
between
the
lions
the
child
s
feet
stumbling
a
little
as
they
went
but
achilles
s
hand
held
fast
and
his
touch
on
the
bell
summoned
hurrying
feet
there
was
a
fumbling
at
the
chains
a
swift
cautious
creak
and
the
door
swung
back
who
is
it
said
a
voice
that
peered
out
the
dawn
touched
his
face
grotesquely
it
s
me
said
the
child
it
s
betty
harris
conner
the
man
s
face
fell
back
then
he
darted
forward
and
glared
at
the
child
through
the
mysterious
dawning
light
on
the
dark
tender
face
and
the
little
lip
that
trembled
looking
up
my
god
he
said
he
had
darted
from
them
the
door
was
open
wide
and
the
two
achilles
led
the
child
to
a
great
divan
across
the
hall
and
placed
her
beside
him
her
little
feet
were
crossed
in
the
rough
shoes
and
her
hands
hung
listless
behind
a
velvet
curtain
the
butler
s
voice
called
frantic
words
a
telephone
bell
rang
sharply
and
whirred
and
rang
a
long
fierce
call
and
the
butler
s
voice
took
it
up
and
flung
it
back
yes
sir
she
s
here
yes
sir
that
s
what
i
said
she
s

on

furriner
yes

put
his
head
around
the
velvet
curtain
will

speak
to
your
father
miss
his
awe
struck
hand
held
the
receiver
and
he
helped
the
strange
little
figure
to
its
seat
in
front
of
the
phone
she
put
the
tube
to
her
lips
hallo
daddy

arms
and
was
sobbing
softly
xxxvii
the
big
bed
achilles
sprang
forward
she
s
all
right
mr
harris
all
right
his
hand
dropped
to
the
trembling
shoulder
and
rested
there
as
his
quiet
voice
repeated
the
words
he
bent
forward
and
lifted
the
child
in
his
arms
and
moved
away
with
her
but
before
he
had
traversed
the
long
hall
the
little
head
had
fallen
forward
on
his
shoulder
and
the
child
slept
behind
the
velvet
curtain
the
voice
of
conner
wrestled
faintly
with
the
telephone
and
all
about
them
great
lights
glowed
on
the
walls
they
lighted
the
great
staircase
that
swept
mistily
up
and
the
figure
of
achilles
mounting
slowly
in
the
stately
lonely
house
the
child
in
his
arms
his
hand
steadied
the
sleeping
head
with
careful
touch
against
his
shoulder
they
were
not
jolting
now
in
heavy
cars
through
the
traffic
streets
or
wandering
on
the
plain
little
betty
harris
had
come
stairs
a
grey
figure
appeared
and
paused
a
moment
and
looked
down
then
miss
stone
descended
swiftly
her
hands
outstretched
they
did
not
touch
the
sleeping
child
but
hovered
above
her
with
a
look
half
pain
half
joy
achilles
smiled
to
her
she
come
home
he
whispered
she
turned
with
quick
breath
and
they
mounted
the
stairs
the
child
still
asleep
through
the
long
corridor
to
the
princess
s
room
beyond
with
its
soft
lights
and
great
silken
hangings
and
canopied
bed
open
for
the
night
waiting
for
betty
harris
achilles
bent
and
laid
her
down
with
lightest
touch
and
straightened
himself
we
let
her
sleep
he
said
gently
she
very
tired
they
stood
looking
down
at
the
brown
face
and
the
little
tired
lip
and
sleeping
lids
their
eyes
met
and
they
smiled
they
knew
these
two
out
of
all
the
world
they
knew
what
it
meant
glowing
dawn
the
great
car
thundered
home
and
betty
harris
s
mother
looked
out
with
swift
eyes
see
phil
the
sun
is
up
she
reached
out
her
hand
sit
still
louie
do
nt
tremble
so
he
said
gently
she
is
safe
now
they
have
brought
her
home
she
s
there
you
know
asleep
he
spoke
slowly
as
if
to
a
child
he
was
gathering
up
the
morning
in
his
heart
this
big
harsh
master
of
men
his
little
girl
was
safe
and
a
common
greek
a
man
out
of
the
streets
peddling
bananas
and
calling
up
and
down
had
made
his
life
worth
living
his
big
tense
mind
gripped
the
fact
and
held
it
something
develop
her
plates
in
order
to
be
sure
that
she
had
a
perfect
likeness
before
releasing
the
specimen
for
she
did
release
all
she
produced
except
one
pair
of
each
kind
never
having
sold
a
moth
personally
often
where
the
markings
were
wonderful
and
complicated
as
soon
as
the
wings
were
fully
developed
mrs
porter
copied
the
living
specimen
in
water
colours
for
her
illustrations
frequently
making
several
copies
in
order
to
be
sure
that
she
laid
on
the
colour
enough
brighter
than
her
subject
so
that
when
it
died
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
shade
never
in
all
my
life
writes
the
author
have
i
had
such
exquisite
joy
in
work
as
i
had
in
painting
the
illustrations
for
this
volume
of
moths
of
the
limberlost
colour
work
had
advanced
to
such
a
stage
that
i
knew
from
the
beautiful
reproductions
in
arthur
rackham
s
rheingold
and
valkyrie
and
several
other
books
on
the
market
that
had
assured
me
personally
that
i
might
count
on
exact
reproduction
and
such
details
of
type
and
paper
as
i
chose
to
select
i
used
the
easel
made
for
me
when
a
girl
under
the
supervision
of
my
father
and
i
threw
my
whole
heart
into
the
work
of
copying
each
line
and
delicate
shading
on
those
wonderful
wings
all
diamonded
with
panes
of
quaint
device
innumerable
stains
and
splendid
dyes
as
one
poet
describes
them
there
were
times
when
in
working
a
mist
of
colour
over
another
background
i
cut
a
brush
down
to
three
hairs
some
of
these
illustrations
i
sent
back
six
and
seven
times
to
be
worked
over
before
the
illustration
plates
were
exact
duplicates
of
the
originals
and
my
heart
ached
for
the
engravers
who
must
have
had
job
like
patience
but
it
did
not
ache
enough
to
stop
me
until
i
felt
the
reproduction
exact
this
book
tells
its
own
story
of
long
and
patient
waiting
for
a
specimen
of
watching
of
disappointments
and
triumphs
it
represents
my
highest
ideals
in
the
making
of
a
nature
book
and
i
can
take
any
skeptic
afield
and
prove
the
truth
of
the
natural
history
it
contains
in
august
of
the
author
s
novel
laddie
was
published
in
new
york
london
sydney
and
toronto
simultaneously
this
book
contains
the
same
mixture
of
romance
and
nature
interest
as
the
others
and
is
modelled
on
the
same
plan
of
introducing
nature
objects
peculiar
to
the
location
and
characters
many
of
whom
are
from
life
typical
of
the
locality
at
a
given
period
the
first
thing
many
critics
said
of
it
was
that
no
such
people
ever
existed
and
no
such
life
was
ever
lived
in
reply
to
this
the
author
said
of
a
truth
the
home
i
described
in
this
book
i
knew
to
the
last
grain
of
wood
in
the
doors
and
i
painted
it
with
absolute
accuracy
and
many
of
the
people
i
described
i
knew
more
intimately
than
i
ever
have
known
any
others
picture
of
home
life
in
a
family
who
were
reared
and
educated
exactly
as
this
book
indicates
there
was
such
a
man
as
laddie
and
he
was
as
much
bigger
and
better
than
my
description
of
him
as
a
real
thing
is
always
better
than
its
presentment
the
only
difference
barring
the
nature
work
between
my
books
and
those
of
many
other
writers
is
that
i
prefer
to
describe
and
to
perpetuate
the
best
i
have
known
in
life
whereas
many
authors
seem
to
feel
that
they
have
no
hope
of
achieving
a
high
literary
standing
unless
they
delve
in
and
reproduce
the
worst
to
deny
that
wrong
and
pitiful
things
exist
in
life
is
folly
but
to
believe
that
these
things
are
made
better
by
promiscuous
discussion
at
the
hands
of
writers
who
fail
to
prove
by
their
books
that
their
viewpoint
is
either
right
clean
or
helpful
is
close
to
insanity
if
there
is
to
be
any
error
on
either
side
in
a
book
then
god
knows
it
is
far
better
that
it
ideals
than
upon
that
of
a
too
loose
discussion
of
subjects
which
often
open
to
a
large
part
of
the
world
their
first
knowledge
of
such
forms
of
sin
profligate
expenditure
and
waste
of
life
s
best
opportunities
there
is
one
great
beauty
in
idealized
romance
reading
it
can
make
no
one
worse
than
he
is
while
it
may
help
thousands
to
a
cleaner
life
and
higher
inspiration
than
they
ever
before
have
known
mrs
porter
has
written
ten
books
and
it
is
not
out
of
place
here
to
express
her
attitude
toward
them
each
was
written
she
says
from
her
heart
s
best
impulses
they
are
as
clean
and
helpful
as
she
knew
how
to
make
them
as
beautiful
and
interesting
she
has
never
spared
herself
in
the
least
degree
mind
or
body
when
it
came
to
giving
her
best
and
she
has
never
considered
money
in
relation
to
what
she
was
writing
during
the
hard
work
and
exposure
of
those
early
years
during
rainy
days
and
many
nights
in
the
sending
around
the
globe
for
books
and
delving
to
secure
material
for
such
books
as
birds
of
the
bible
music
of
the
wild
and
moths
of
the
limberlost
every
day
devoted
to
such
work
was
commercially
lost
as
publishers
did
not
fail
to
tell
her
but
that
was
the
work
she
could
do
and
do
with
exceeding
joy
she
could
do
it
better
pictorially
on
account
of
her
lifelong
knowledge
of
living
things
afield
than
any
other
woman
had
as
yet
had
the
strength
and
nerve
to
do
it
it
was
work
in
which
she
gloried
and
she
persisted
had
i
been
working
for
money
comments
the
author
not
one
of
these
nature
books
ever
would
have
been
written
or
an
illustration
made
when
the
public
had
discovered
her
and
given
generous
approval
to
a
girl
of
the
limberlost
when
the
harvester
had
established
a
new
record
that
would
have
been
the
time
for
the
author
to
lacy
answered
listen
here
is
the
tale
good
exclaimed
de
wilton
at
the
end
she
punished
darby
well
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
it
and
it
cut
him
suddenly
he
struck
the
wall
sharply
and
yet
she
rides
with
him
to
day
st
george
we
are
back
where
we
started
women
are
queer
creatures
just
then
sir
james
dacre
stopped
at
the
corridor
door
who
is
for
a
ride
he
asked
i
am
said
de
lacy
if
sir
ralph
will
excuse
me
de
wilton
nodded
go
by
all
means
it
was
good
of
you
to
keep
me
company
even
for
a
moment
i
might
venture
to
guess
said
dacre
as
they
cantered
across
the
bailey
toward
the
gate
that
that
black
of
yours
was
never
foaled
in
england
i
got
selim
in
spain
de
lacy
answered
and
with
him
the
story
that
he
came
from
the
stables
of
the
soldan
of
granada
but
of
that
i
can
not
vouch
nor
do
i
care
patting
the
shining
shoulder
he
is
my
good
friend
and
companion
and
he
has
never
failed
with
its
bright
full
kind
eye
broad
forehead
tapered
muzzle
thin
sensitive
nostrils
and
ears
at
the
arched
neck
the
deep
chest
the
rather
short
barrel
the
narrow
waist
powerful
flanks
and
sinewy
springy
slender
legs
he
is
beautiful
he
said
methinks
i
never
saw
so
perfect
a
horse
and
his
intelligence
is
in
kind
said
aymer
he
has
many
accomplishments
but
the
one
most
satisfactory
to
me
is
the
way
he
understands
my
voice
observe
he
dropped
the
reins
over
the
pommel
and
at
the
word
selim
without
touch
of
knee
or
shift
of
bit
went
through
all
the
gaits
and
facings
ending
with
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
seven
artificial
movements
of
the
horse
sir
james
dacre
s
rather
cold
face
warmed
with
admiration
and
he
reined
over
and
stroked
the
black
s
soft
muzzle
you
are
a
wonder
selim
he
said
your
equal
short
dash
the
countess
bay
mare
might
put
you
to
your
speed
very
likely
said
aymer
but
i
will
wager
there
is
none
in
england
can
beat
him
from
the
solway
to
land
s
end
dacre
smiled
i
would
rather
share
the
bet
than
take
it
then
the
talk
led
to
the
horses
of
france
and
spain
and
thence
to
the
life
there
in
general
for
sir
james
had
never
crossed
the
channel
and
he
plied
his
companion
with
questions
and
so
they
jogged
along
in
pleasant
converse
and
de
lacy
saw
that
the
reserved
and
quiet
dacre
was
in
fact
as
sincere
and
good
hearted
as
the
generously
impulsive
de
wilton
and
he
warmed
to
them
both
for
he
had
anticipated
cold
looks
hatred
and
jealousy
such
as
under
like
conditions
he
would
have
met
with
on
the
continent
and
as
they
rode
there
came
a
faint
hail
from
the
front
and
thrice
repeated
the
track
at
that
point
led
through
a
wood
and
was
straight
the
left
just
near
the
turn
were
two
horsemen
and
the
rearmost
when
he
saw
his
cry
had
been
heard
waved
his
hat
and
gesticulated
violently
toward
the
other
who
was
several
lengths
in
front
both
were
coming
at
top
speed
sir
james
dacre
puckered
his
eyes
and
peered
ahead
my
sight
is
rather
poor
he
said
but
from
yonder
fellow
s
motions
i
take
it
he
wants
us
to
stop
the
other
an
escape
doubtless
just
then
the
one
in
the
lead
shot
through
a
patch
of
sunlight
and
both
knights
cried
out
a
woman
said
de
lacy
the
countess
exclaimed
dacre
what
may
it
mean
she
went
riding
with
lord
darby
shortly
after
mid
day
said
aymer
and
that
is
darby
added
dacre
as
the
sun
hit
the
second
horseman
pardieu
i
do
not
understand
it
can
not
be
she
is
fleeing
from
him
they
drew
rein
and
watched
the
she
is
succeeding
aymer
observed
she
is
gaining
on
him
at
every
jump
st
denis
how
that
horse
of
hers
can
run
it
is
wilda
the
bay
mare
i
spoke
of
but
see
darby
still
waves
what
in
heaven
s
name
ails
the
man
can
it
be
the
mare
has
bolted
de
lacy
shook
his
head
the
countess
is
making
no
effort
to
control
her
the
reins
are
hanging
loose
then
they
heard
the
first
faint
beat
of
the
hoofs
growing
louder
and
louder
and
presently
with
it
darby
s
cry
stop
her
stop
her
maybe
my
lord
said
de
lacy
leaning
forward
his
eyes
intent
upon
the
countess
if
the
lady
wish
it
she
will
signal
two
hundred
yards
away
now
came
wilda
running
at
terrific
speed
but
straight
and
true
suddenly
de
lacy
swung
selim
around
it
is
a
runaway
he
called
to
dacre
he
said
it
the
countess
told
him
the
same
by
a
motion
of
her
hand
a
moment
more
and
she
swept
between
them
but
beside
her
went
the
black
leap
for
leap
with
the
bay
then
aymer
saw
the
trouble
the
bit
had
broken
in
the
bar
tearing
the
mouth
badly
and
from
each
cheek
strap
dangled
a
useless
half
which
striking
the
frightened
mare
on
the
muzzle
kept
driving
her
to
top
speed
the
countess
gave
de
lacy
a
quick
smile
i
am
trying
to
enjoy
it
she
said
but
i
think
i
am
dreadfully
frightened
aymer
glanced
at
the
road
it
was
straight
and
level
for
another
four
hundred
yards
then
it
disappeared
and
he
remembered
it
pitched
sharply
forward
in
a
rough
and
twisting
descent
whatever
he
did
must
be
done
quickly
no
horse
ever
foaled
could
carry
its
rider
down
that
declivity
at
such
a
speed
death
waits
yonder
he
said
pointing
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
i
must
lift
you
to
my
saddle
then
suddenly
loosed
her
foot
from
the
stirrup
i
am
ready
she
said
and
smiled
again
de
lacy
dropped
his
reins
closer
selim
closer
he
commanded
the
black
drew
over
until
his
master
s
boot
was
pressing
the
countess
he
says
to
mrs
steele
there
is
a
chorus
of
disappointment
from
the
assembled
crowd
but
mrs
steele
with
evident
reluctance
says
be
left
behind
there
s
yellow
fever
in
all
these
ports
i
m
told
place
is
full
of
it
stay
on
the
ship
like
sensible
people
there
s
nothing
worth
seeing
in
guatemala
i
hate
to
be
bothered
with
passengers
going
off
and
the
captain
walks
to
the
railing
to
wave
his
hand
with
stiff
pomposity
to
a
mexican
who
sits
in
the
lighter
you
air
meestake
captain
says
the
baron
de
bach
all
dthose
vorkmen
say
it
vill
be
two
days
loading
this
cafe
the
captain
never
very
good
tempered
at
the
best
of
times
is
especially
peppery
to
day
are
you
runnin
this
ship
young
man
or
am
i
he
seems
to
think
he
has
made
a
forcible
and
irrefutable
rejoinder
and
turns
away
like
one
who
has
settled
something
forever
i
vill
spik
with
you
inside
the
baron
sets
down
his
small
valise
and
follows
the
apparently
unheeding
captain
into
the
saloon
we
stand
undecided
looking
and
watching
a
stout
mexican
get
into
a
huge
barrel
that
has
one
side
cut
down
and
a
seat
fitted
in
a
rope
with
huge
iron
hook
attached
is
lowered
from
a
pulley
on
the
steamer
and
the
barrel
full
of
san
jose
official
is
lifted
into
the
air
the
barrel
twirls
about
the
official
puts
his
hand
to
his
eyes
and
in
a
moment
he
is
landed
like
a
mammoth
fish
on
the
deck
of
the
san
miguel
we
hear
the
voices
in
the
saloon
rising
with
anger
mrs
steele
looks
apprehensive
and
makes
a
step
towards
the
door
out
strides
the
baron
looking
hot
and
excited
ladies
ve
vill
go
i
promise
you
ve
vill
be
back
in
time
already
the
crowd
is
lessened
and
some
have
given
up
going
even
to
san
jose
and
several
have
made
the
trip
in
the
barrel
and
are
safely
landed
in
the
lighter
i
think
we
wo
nt
run
any
risk
says
mrs
steele
gently
though
we
can
go
to
i
do
assure
you
and
the
baron
is
most
emphatic
if
you
vill
trust
to
go
with
me
i
see
that
you
come
safe
back
before
san
miguel
sails
the
second
mate
comes
up
with
an
amused
look
you
ladies
jest
go
long
th
cap
n
s
alwus
like
that
nobuddy
minds
we
ca
nt
get
away
under
two
days
and
he
knows
it
we
ai
nt
lowed
to
leave
under
forty
eight
hours
on
count
o
passengers
from
the
coast
that
settles
it
and
each
in
turn
we
go
spinning
down
in
the
barrel
and
sit
on
piles
of
freight
in
the
unsteady
lighter
the
mexican
oarsmen
stand
up
and
propel
the
boat
through
the
surf
with
long
oars
it
is
rougher
than
it
looks
and
i
suffer
my
first
touch
of
sea
sickness
we
understand
why
we
are
anchored
so
far
away
and
why
the
huge
iron
pier
running
out
from
san
jose
extends
such
a
distance
seawards
i
am
quite
faint
and
miserable
when
consumed
with
rage
at
the
captain
s
interference
he
has
no
eyes
happily
for
my
pitiable
condition
i
look
about
disconsolately
for
the
barrel
elevator
for
the
pier
is
far
above
our
heads
and
the
great
waves
are
dashing
us
against
its
iron
side
to
mrs
steele
s
horror
we
perceive
a
sort
of
iron
cage
is
employed
in
the
process
of
elevation
at
this
end
of
the
journey
and
soon
we
three
are
swinging
in
mid
air
between
the
angry
waves
and
the
iron
pier
oh
i
say
breathlessly
clutching
at
mrs
steele
what
would
uncle
john
say
if
he
could
see
me
now
he
would
probably
advise
you
to
follow
his
example
and
make
your
observations
from
the
outside
of
the
cage
i
ve
observed
that
mrs
steele
is
sometimes
lacking
in
sympathy
at
trying
moments
at
last
we
are
landed
and
at
the
end
of
the
long
pier
we
find
a
narrow
gauge
train
strange
primitive
little
cars
and
very
dirty
withal
the
windows
and
each
one
occupying
a
double
seat
for
the
carriage
is
only
half
full
it
s
not
more
than
seventy
miles
i
believe
says
mrs
steele
but
it
takes
five
hours
to
get
there
it
s
an
up
hill
grade
all
the
way
five
hours
i
repeat
dismayed
oh
why
did
no
one
tell
me
that
before
i
had
scarcely
a
mouthful
of
breakfast
we
haf
another
breakfast
at
escuintla
mees
a
gude
one
says
senor
noma
passing
through
our
coach
to
the
smoking
car
i
am
consoled
and
full
of
interest
at
the
prospect
as
the
dingy
little
train
moves
off
mrs
steele
and
i
are
facing
each
other
while
the
baron
sits
behind
me
and
points
out
the
most
noteworthy
features
of
this
notable
expedition
we
are
in
the
tropics
truly
the
heat
is
overpowering
and
the
baron
leans
over
the
back
of
my
seat
with
my
rough
mazatlan
fan
and
uses
it
with
me
do
fan

the

see
the
banana
received
a
shock
from
mr
and
mrs
bell
she
had
not
for
one
moment
doubted
that
they
would
be
delighted
to
find
that
susan
could
have
a
good
home
good
wages
and
a
city
life
instead
of
the
existence
in
such
a
town
as
clarence
well
now
mr
bell
said
we
gotter
sort
o
talk
it
over
me
an
ma
fore
we
decide
that
susan
s
a
most
our
baby

hai
nt
but
four
of
em
younger
than
what
she
is
in
our
fambly
we
ll
let
you
know
hey
ma
and
pa
bell
talked
it
over
carefully
and
came
to
a
decision
the
decision
was
the
neighbors
the
neighbors
met
at
bell
s
and
talked
it
over
openly
in
the
presence
of
mrs
smith
they
agreed
that
it
would
be
a
great
chance
for
susan
and
they
said
that
no
one
could
want
a
nicer
kinder
lady
for
boss
than
what
mrs
smith
was
but
tai
nt
noways
right
to
take
no
risks
you
see
ma
am
said
ma
bell
we
do
nt
know
who
you
are
no
more
than
nothin
do
we
and
we
do
know
how
as
them
big
towns
is
ungodly
to
beat
the
band
do
nt
we
i
remember
my
grandma
tellin
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
about
the
awful
goin
s
on
she
heard
tell
of
one
time
when
she
was
down
to
pittsburg
and
i
reckon
new
york
must
be
twice
the
size
of
pittsburg
was
them
days
so
it
must
be
twice
as
wicked
so
we
tell
you
plain
without
meanin
no
harm
that
we
do
nt
know
who
you
are
got
her
to
new
york
oh
i
now
what
you
want
said
mrs
smith
you
want
references
them
s
it
said
mrs
bell
with
great
relief
well
said
mrs
smith
that
is
easy
i
know
everybody
in
new
york
she
thought
a
moment
there
s
mr
murray
of
murray
s
magazine
she
suggested
mentioning
her
friend
of
the
great
monthly
magazine
guess
we
never
heard
of
that
said
mrs
bell
doubtfully
then
do
you
know
the
aeon
magazine
i
know
the
editor
of
aeon
the
neighbors
and
mrs
bell
looked
at
each
other
blankly
and
shook
their
heads
mrs
smith
named
all
the
magazines
she
had
contributed
stories
to
most
of
them
but
not
one
was
known
even
by
name
to
her
inquisitors
one
shy
old
lady
asked
faintly
if
she
had
ever
heard
of
mr
tweed
she
thought
she
had
heard
of
a
mister
suddenly
mrs
smith
remembered
her
own
brother
the
great
marriott
nolan
tarbro
whose
romances
sold
in
editions
of
hundreds
of
thousands
and
who
was
beyond
all
doubt
the
greatest
living
novelist
kings
had
been
glad
to
meet
him
and
newsboys
and
gamins
ran
shouting
at
his
heels
when
he
walked
the
streets
how
silly
of
me
she
said
you
must
have
heard
of
my
brother
marriott
nolan
tarbro
you
know
who
wrote
the
marquis
of
glenmore
and
the
train
wreckers
mrs
bell
coughed
apologetically
behind
her
hand
i
m
not
very
littery
mrs
smith
she
said
kindly
but
mebby
mrs
stein
knows
of
him
mrs
stein
reads
a
lot
mrs
stein
whose
sole
reading
was
the
bible
and
such
advertising
booklets
as
came
by
mail
or
as
she
could
pick
up
on
the
counter
of
the
drugstore
when
she
went
to
kilo
moved
uneasily
for
years
she
had
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
sister
of
an
author
she
feared
her
reputation
was
about
to
fall
what
say
his
name
was
she
asked
tarbro
said
mrs
smith
as
one
would
mention
shakespeare
or
napoleon
tarbro
marriott
nolan
tarbro
well
said
mrs
stein
slowly
turning
her
head
on
one
side
and
looking
at
the
spot
on
the
ceiling
from
which
the
plaster
had
fallen
i
wo
nt
say
i
have
nt
and
i
wo
nt
say
i
have
when
a
person
reads
as
much
as
what
i
do
she
reads
so
many
names
they
slip
out
of
memory
just
this
minute
i
do
nt
quite
call
him
to
mind
mighty
near
though
i
mind
a
feller
once
that
peddled
notions
through
here
name
of
tarbox
might
you
know
him
no
said
mrs
smith
i
have
nt
the
honor
i
thought
mebby
you
might
know
him
said
mrs
stein
his
business
took
him
took
him
to
new
york
and
that
mebby
you
might
have
met
him
mrs
bell
sighed
audibly
it
s
goin
to
be
an
awful
trial
to
susan
if
she
ca
nt
go
she
said
but
i
du
n
no
what
to
say
seems
like
i
ought
nt
to
say
go
an
yet
i
ca
nt
abear
to
say
stay
i
must
have
susan
said
mrs
smith
putting
her
arm
about
the
girl
i
know
you
can
trust
her
with
me
clementina
said
mr
bell
suddenly
why
do
nt
you
leave
it
to
the
minister
he
d
settle
it
for
the
best
why
do
nt
you
leave
it
to
him
hey
well
bless
my
stars
said
mrs
bell
brightening
with
relief
i
d
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
long
ago
he
would
know
what
was
for
the
best
i
ll
ask
him
to
morrow
the
way
for
eliph
hewlitt
the
minister
left
the
group
of
women
who
had
clustered
about
him
and
walked
toward
her
sister
smith
he
said
in
his
grave
kind
way
sister
bell
tells
me
you
want
to
carry
off
our
little
susan
you
know
we
must
be
wise
as
serpents
and
gentle
as
doves
i
deciding
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
though
i
doubt
not
all
will
be
well
i
must
think
over
the
matter
a
while
welcome
brother
he
added
offering
his
hand
to
eliph
hewlitt
the
little
book
agent
shook
it
warmly
i
was
a
stranger
and
ye
took
me
in
he
said
glibly
fine
weather
for
a
picnic
his
eyes
glowed
to
meet
the
minister
first
of
all
this
was
good
indeed
years
of
experience
had
taught
him
to
seek
in
him
deterioration
is
easy
in
the
hills
superficial
deterioration
in
habits
manners
personal
appearance
and
the
practices
of
all
the
little
niceties
of
life
conditions
of
a
mountain
cabin
and
if
possible
might
if
practised
excite
wonder
and
comment
if
not
vague
suspicion
sleeping
garments
are
practically
barred
for
the
same
reason
shaving
becomes
a
rare
luxury
a
lost
tooth
brush
may
not
be
replaced
for
a
month
in
time
one
may
bring
himself
to
eat
with
a
knife
for
the
reason
that
it
is
hard
for
a
hungry
man
to
feed
himself
with
a
fork
that
has
but
two
tines
the
finger
tips
cease
to
be
the
culminating
standard
of
the
gentleman
it
is
hard
to
keep
a
supply
of
fresh
linen
when
one
is
constantly
in
the
saddle
and
a
constant
weariness
of
body
and
a
ravenous
appetite
make
a
man
indifferent
to
things
like
a
bad
bed
and
worse
food
particularly
as
he
must
philosophically
put
up
with
them
anyhow
of
all
these
things
the
man
himself
may
be
quite
unconscious
and
yet
they
affect
him
more
deeply
than
he
knows
and
show
to
a
woman
even
in
his
voice
his
walk
his
mouth
everywhere
save
in
his
kindliness
or
when
there
has
been
some
serious
break
down
of
soul
or
character
within
and
the
woman
will
not
look
to
his
eyes
for
the
truth
which
makes
its
way
slowly
particularly
when
the
woman
has
striven
for
the
very
things
that
the
man
has
so
recklessly
let
go
she
would
never
suffer
herself
to
let
down
in
such
a
way
and
she
does
not
understand
how
a
man
can
hale
s
life
since
his
college
doors
had
closed
behind
him
had
always
been
a
rough
one
he
had
dropped
from
civilization
and
had
gone
back
into
it
many
times
and
each
time
he
had
dropped
he
dropped
the
deeper
and
for
that
reason
had
come
back
into
his
own
life
each
time
with
more
difficulty
and
with
more
indifference
the
last
had
been
his
roughest
year
and
he
had
sunk
a
little
more
deeply
just
at
the
time
when
june
had
been
pluming
herself
for
flight
from
such
depths
forever
moreover
hale
had
been
dominant
in
every
matter
that
his
hand
or
his
brain
had
touched
his
habit
was
done
though
he
was
no
longer
acting
captain
of
the
police
guard
he
always
acted
as
captain
whenever
he
was
on
hand
and
always
he
was
the
undisputed
leader
in
all
questions
of
business
politics
or
the
maintenance
of
order
and
law
the
success
he
had
forged
had
hardened
and
strengthened
his
mouth
steeled
his
eyes
and
made
him
more
masterful
in
manner
speech
and
point
of
view
and
naturally
had
added
nothing
to
his
gentleness
his
unselfishness
his
refinement
or
the
nice
consideration
of
little
things
on
which
women
lay
such
stress
it
was
an
hour
by
sun
when
he
clattered
through
the
gap
and
pushed
his
tired
black
horse
into
a
gallop
across
the
valley
toward
the
town
he
saw
the
smoke
of
the
little
dummy
and
as
he
thundered
over
the
bridge
of
the
north
fork
he
saw
that
it
was
just
about
to
pull
out
and
he
waved
his
hat
and
shouted
imperiously
for
it
to
wait
with
his
hand
on
the
bell
rope
the
conductor
autocrat
that
he
reins
to
the
man
who
was
nearest
hardly
seeing
who
he
was
and
climbed
aboard
he
wore
a
slouched
hat
spotted
by
contact
with
the
roof
of
the
mines
which
he
had
hastily
visited
on
his
way
through
lonesome
cove
the
growth
of
three
days
beard
was
on
his
face
he
wore
a
gray
woollen
shirt
and
a
blue
handkerchief
none
too
clean
was
loosely
tied
about
his
sun
scorched
column
of
a
throat
he
was
spotted
with
mud
from
his
waist
to
the
soles
of
his
rough
riding
boots
and
his
hands
were
rough
and
grimy
but
his
eye
was
bright
and
keen
and
his
heart
thumped
eagerly
again
it
was
the
middle
of
june
and
the
town
was
a
naked
island
in
a
sea
of
leaves
whose
breakers
literally
had
run
mountain
high
and
stopped
for
all
time
motionless
purple
lights
thick
as
mist
veiled
powell
s
mountain
below
the
valley
was
still
flooded
with
yellow
sunlight
which
lay
along
the
mountain
sides
and
was
streaked
here
and
there
with
the
long
shadow
of
a
deep
ravine
the
bodies
scantily
draped
with
green
and
the
yawning
gap
held
the
yellow
light
as
a
bowl
holds
wine
he
had
long
ago
come
to
look
upon
the
hills
merely
as
storehouses
for
iron
and
coal
put
there
for
his
special
purpose
but
now
the
long
submerged
sense
of
the
beauty
of
it
all
stirred
within
him
again
for
june
was
the
incarnate
spirit
of
it
all
and
june
was
coming
back
to
those
mountains
and
to
him
and
june
june
had
seen
the
change
in
hale
the
first
year
he
had
come
often
to
new
york
to
see
her
and
they
had
gone
to
the
theatre
and
the
opera
and
june
was
pleased
to
play
the
part
of
heroine
in
what
was
such
a
real
romance
to
the
other
girls
in
school
and
she
was
proud
of
hale
but
each
time
he
came
he
seemed
less
interested
in
the
diversions
that
meant
so
much
to
her
more
absorbed
in
his
affairs
in
the
mountains
and
less
particular
about
his
looks
his
visits
came
at
and
each
time
he
seemed
more
eager
to
get
away
she
had
been
shy
about
appearing
before
him
for
the
first
time
in
evening
dress
and
when
he
entered
the
drawing
room
she
stood
under
a
chandelier
in
blushing
and
resplendent
confusion
but
he
seemed
not
to
recognize
that
he
had
never
seen
her
that
way
before
and
for
another
reason
june
remained
confused
disappointed
and
hurt
for
he
was
not
only
unobserving
and
seemingly
unappreciative
but
he
was
more
silent
than
ever
that
night
and
he
looked
gloomy
but
he
a
railroad
king
she
whispered
in
a
mocking
awe
stricken
voice
is
he
rich
oh
rich
as
solomon
and
is
he
a
terrible
man
who
eats
people
alive
all
the
time
yes
said
montague
that
must
be
the
one
well
said
betty
he
has
done
me
the
honour
to
be
my
granddaddy
but
do
nt
you
take
any
letter
of
introduction
to
perplexed
because
he
ll
eat
you
said
the
girl
he
hates
ollie
dear
me
said
the
other
and
the
girl
asked
do
you
mean
that
the
boy
has
nt
said
a
word
about
me
no
said
montague
i
suppose
he
left
it
for
you
to
do
well
said
betty
it
s
like
a
fairy
story
do
you
ever
read
fairy
stories
in
this
story
there
was
a
princess
oh
the
most
beautiful
princess
do
you
understand
yes
said
montague
she
wore
a
red
rose
in
her
hair
and
then
said
the
girl
there
was
a
young
courtier
very
handsome
and
gay
and
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
but
the
terrible
old
king
he
wanted
his
daughter
to
wait
a
while
until
he
got
through
conquering
his
enemies
so
that
he
might
have
time
to
pick
who
was
wasting
his
lands
do
you
follow
me
perfectly
said
he
and
then
did
the
beautiful
princess
pine
away
um
no
said
betty
pursing
her
lips
but
she
had
to
dance
terribly
hard
to
keep
from
thinking
about
herself
then
she
laughed
and
exclaimed
dear
me
we
are
getting
poetical
and
next
looking
sober
again
do
you
know
i
was
half
afraid
to
talk
to
you
ollie
tells
me
you
re
terribly
serious
are
you
i
do
nt
know
said
montague
but
she
broke
in
with
a
laugh
we
were
talking
about
you
at
dinner
last
night
they
had
some
whipped
cream
done
up
in
funny
little
curliques
and
ollie
said
now
if
my
brother
allan
were
here
he
d
be
thinking
about
the
man
who
fixed
this
cream
and
how
long
it
took
him
and
how
he
might
have
been
reading
it
involves
a
question
of
literary
criticism
said
montague
i
do
nt
want
to
talk
about
literature
exclaimed
the
other
in
truth
she
wanted
nothing
save
to
feel
of
his
armour
and
find
out
if
there
were
any
weak
spots
through
which
he
could
be
teased
montague
was
to
find
in
time
that
the
adorable
miss
elizabeth
was
a
very
thorny
species
of
rose
she
was
more
like
a
gay
coloured
wasp
of
predatory
temperament
ollie
says
you
want
to
go
down
town
and
work
she
went
on
i
think
you
re
awfully
foolish
is
nt
it
much
nicer
to
spend
your
time
in
an
imitation
castle
like
this
perhaps
said
he
but
i
have
nt
any
castle
you
might
get
one
answered
betty
stay
around
awhile
and
let
us
marry
you
to
a
nice
girl
they
will
all
throw
themselves
at
your
feet
you
know
for
you
have
such
a
delicious
melting
voice
made
a
note
to
inquire
whether
it
was
customary
in
new
york
to
talk
about
you
so
frankly
to
your
face
miss
betty
was
surveying
him
quizzically
meantime
i
do
nt
know
she
said
on
second
thoughts
maybe
you
ll
frighten
the
girls
then
it
ll
be
the
married
women
who
ll
fall
in
love
with
you
you
ll
have
to
watch
out
i
ve
already
been
told
that
by
my
tailor
said
montague
with
a
laugh
that
would
be
a
still
quicker
way
of
making
your
fortune
said
she
but
i
do
nt
think
you
d
fit
in
the
role
of
a
tame
cat
a
what
he
exclaimed
and
miss
betty
laughed
do
nt
you
know
what
that
is
dear
me
how
charmingly
naive
but
perhaps
you
d
better
get
ollie
to
explain
for
you
that
brought
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
slang
and
montague
in
a
sudden
burst
of
confidence
utterance
she
said
he
repeated
slowly
that
when
i
got
to
be
pally
with
her
i
d
conclude
she
did
nt
furnish
oh
yes
said
miss
wyman
she
just
meant
that
when
you
knew
her
you
d
be
disappointed
you
see
she
picks
up
all
the
race
track
slang
one
ca
nt
help
it
you
know
and
last
year
she
took
her
coach
over
to
england
and
so
she
s
got
all
the
english
slang
that
makes
it
hard
even
for
us
and
then
betty
sailed
in
to
entertain
him
with
little
sketches
of
other
members
of
the
party
a
phenomenon
that
had
struck
montague
immediately
was
the
extraordinary
freedom
with
which
everybody
in
new
york
discussed
everybody
else
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
seldom
discussed
anything
else
and
it
made
not
the
least
difference
though
the
person
were
one
of
your
set
though
he
ate
your
bread
and
salt
and
you
ate
his
still
and
humiliating
and
terrifying
things
about
him
there
was
poor
clarrie
mason
clarrie
sitting
in
at
bridge
with
an
expression
of
feverish
eagerness
upon
his
pale
face
clarrie
always
lost
and
it
positively
broke
his
heart
though
he
had
ten
millions
laid
by
on
ice
clarrie
went
about
all
day
bemoaning
his
brother
who
had
been
kidnapped
had
montague
not
heard
about
it
well
the
newspapers
called
it
a
marriage
but
it
was
really
a
kidnapping
poor
larry
mason
was
good
natured
and
weak
in
the
knees
and
he
had
been
carried
off
by
a
terrible
creature
three
times
as
big
as
himself
and
with
a
temper
like
oh
there
were
no
words
for
it
she
had
been
an
actress
and
now
she
had
carried
larry
away
in
her
talons
and
was
building
a
big
castle
to
keep
him
in
for
he
had
ten
millions
too
alas
and
then
there
was
bertie
stuyvesant
beautiful
and
winning
the
boy
who
had
sat
opposite
montague
at
and
nobody
knew
how
many
millions
he
had
left
bertie
was
gay
last
week
he
had
invited
them
to
a
brook
trout
breakfast
in
november
and
that
had
been
a
he
would
never
agree
to
a
plan
of
that
sort
it
was
therefore
necessary
for
her
to
deceive
him
in
more
ways
than
one
plainly
speaking
brock
had
laboured
under
the
delusion
that
she
merely
proposed
to
bribe
the
gaoler
into
letting
him
off
for
the
night
in
order
that
by
some
hook
or
crook
they
could
be
married
early
in
the
morning
provided
her
conception
of
the
state
marriage
laws
as
they
applied
to
aliens
was
absolutely
correct
it
was
not
correct
it
may
be
well
to
state
although
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
this
moment
if
he
had
but
known
that
she
contemplated
paying
ten
thousand
and
that
he
was
expected
to
catch
a
night
train
across
the
border
it
is
only
just
to
his
manhood
to
say
that
he
should
have
balked
even
though
the
act
were
to
cost
him
years
of
prison
servitude
which
of
course
was
unlikely
in
the
face
of
the
explanation
that
would
be
made
in
proper
time
by
the
real
medcroft
it
thus
may
be
seen
that
brock
not
only
had
been
vilely
imprisoned
twice
in
the
same
night
but
that
he
was
very
much
in
the
dark
notwithstanding
his
attempt
to
make
light
of
the
situation
it
occurred
to
him
at
two
o
clock
that
pacing
the
floor
in
the
agony
of
suspense
was
a
very
useless
occupation
he
would
go
to
bed
morning
would
bring
relief
and
surcease
to
his
troubled
mind
constance
was
doubtless
sound
asleep
in
her
room
everything
would
have
been
explained
to
her
long
before
this
hour
she
would
understand
so
with
the
return
of
his
old
sophistry
he
undressed
and
crawled
into
the
strange
bed
somehow
in
the
balcony
below
just
as
he
was
dropping
off
into
the
long
delayed
slumber
he
heard
a
light
tapping
at
his
door
he
sat
up
in
bed
like
a
flash
thoroughly
wide
awake
the
rapping
was
repeated
he
called
out
in
cautious
tones
asking
who
was
there
at
the
same
time
slipping
from
bed
to
fumble
in
the
darkness
for
his
clothes
sh
came
from
the
hallway
he
rushed
over
and
put
his
ear
to
the
door
it
is
i
are
you
awake
i
ca
nt
stay
here
it
s
wrong
listen
here
is
a
note
under
the
door
good
night
darling
i
m
heartbroken
thank
god
it
s
you
he
cried
softly
how
i
love
you
constance
sh
edith
is
with
me
oh
i
wish
it
were
morning
and
i
could
see
you
i
have
so
much
to
say
another
querulous
voice
broke
in
for
heaven
s
our
reputations
are
bad
enough
as
it
is
good
night
roxbury
he
distinctly
heard
the
heartless
edith
giggle
then
came
the
soft
quick
swish
of
garments
and
the
nocturnal
visitors
were
gone
he
picked
up
the
envelope
and
waiting
until
they
were
safely
down
the
hall
turned
on
the
light
dearest
he
read
it
was
not
my
fault
and
i
know
it
was
not
yours
but
oh
you
do
nt
know
how
i
suffered
all
through
those
hours
of
waiting
at
the
cafe
they
did
not
find
me
until
after
two
they
were
drunk
they
tried
to
explain
what
do
you
think
the
authorities
will
do
to
me
if
they
find
that
i
gave
that
horrid
man
bribe
money
really
i
m
terribly
nervous
but
he
wo
nt
dare
say
anything
will
he
he
is
as
guilty
as
i
for
he
took
it
he
took
it
knowing
that
you
were
free
at
the
time
but
we
will
talk
it
over
to
morrow
would
nt
go
to
bed
until
edith
brought
me
up
to
hear
your
dear
voice
i
am
so
glad
you
are
not
dead
it
is
impossible
to
release
you
to
night
those
wretches
have
the
key
how
i
loathe
them
edith
says
the
hotel
is
wild
with
gossip
about
everything
and
everybody
it
s
just
awful
be
of
good
heart
my
beloved
i
will
be
your
faithful
slave
until

and
adoration
and
kisses

not

sign
edith

several
floors
below
the
relieved
and
ecstatic
brock
mrs
medcroft
was
soon
urging
her
sister
to
go
to
bed
and
let
the
story
go
until
daylight
she
persisted
in
telling
all
that
she
had
done
and
all
that
she
had
endured
we
must
never
let
him
know
that
we
actually
gave
that
wretch
nearly
twenty
five
hundred
dollars
edith
he
would
never
forgive
us
i
admit
that
i
was
a
fool
and
a
ninny
so
do
nt
tell
me
i
looking
that
you
re
just
crazy
to
it
s
all
roxbury
s
fault
anyway
why
should
he
get
up
and
make
a
speech
in
london
without
letting
us
know
just
see
how
it
has
placed
us
i
think
mr
brock
is
an
angel
to
do
what
he
has
done
for
you
and
roxbury
yes
my
dear
you
will
have
to
confess
that
roxbury
is
a
brute
a
perfect
brute
i
m
sure
if
you
have
a
spark
of
fairness
in
you
you
must
hate
him
no
no
do
nt
say
anything
edith
you

i

right
i

not
going

going

edith
if
you

i
think
i

sleep
with
you
after
a
moment
of
deep
reflection

added
plaintively
there

much
that

just
have
to
tell
you
deary
it
it
wo

keep
till
daylight
bright
and
were
routed
from
their
rooms
by
a
demand
from
the
management
of
the
hotel
that
they
appear
forthwith
in
the
private
office
this
order
included
every
member
of
mr
rodney
s
party
excepting
the
medcroft
baby
considerably
distressed
and
very
much
concerned
over
the
probable
outcome
of
the
conference
the
rodney
forces
made
their
way
to
the
offices
not
altogether
in
an
open
fashion
but
by
humiliatingly
unusual
avenues
the
rodney
family
came
down
the
back
stairs
brock
more
sleep
to
night
he
laughed
like
ches
it
ai
nt
that
anything
will
hurt
me
out
here
but
i
m
everlastingly
scared
he
watched
the
night
out
revelling
in
his
enjoyment
of
the
mystery
of
the
coming
morning
that
phase
of
the
day
which
never
ceases
to
be
unreal
and
which
calls
out
of
the
watcher
sentiments
and
emotions
he
is
a
stranger
to
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
sun
hung
on
the
he
woke
the
boy
ches
was
all
amazement
for
a
second
then
he
gave
a
glad
cry
gee

ches
rustled
around
after
sticks
in
his
funny
angularly
active
style
singing
it
was
a
merry
song
about
mother
slowly
going
down
the
hectic
path
of
phthisis

led
to

is
shortly
to

in
the
narrow
confines
of

five

in
astonishment

disgust

yessir

replied
ches
hesitatingly
lord
thought
jim
what
a

a
recreation
then
aloud
it
s
bad
luck
to
sing
before
breakfast
ches
i
ll
teach
you
a
livelier
song
than
that
when
we
hit
the
trail
again
so
it
came
to
pass
that
during
the
first
miles
of
their
day
s
journey
the
way
was
enlivened
by
the
notes
of
the
arkansas
traveler
garry
owen
where
s
my
linda
cinda
gone
baltimore
girls
and
other
songs
of
a
lively
character
ches
approved
of
these
in
moderation
then
jim
tried
an
experiment
with
a
serious
face
but
half
an
eye
on
the
boy
he
howled
moaned
and
grunted

cried
the
boy
enthusiastically
jim
sat
him
down
by
the
roadside
and
laughed

i

he
gasped
the
boy
was
hurt
in
a
way
he
could
not
understand
something
pained
him
a
new
sensation
of
not
being
up
to
the
requirements
of

looked
at
the
pathetic
little
figure
on
that

boy
he
replied
very
kindly
i

only
joking

replied
ches
it
s
all
square
a
little
farther
on
jim
noticed
a
piece
of
quartz
outcrop
with
a
metal
stain
on
it
now
a
miner
can
no
more
pass
such
a
thing
than
some
others
could
refuse
to
pick
up
the
pin
shining
at
their
feet
so
he
took
a
stone
and
hammered
off
a
specimen
for
future
reference
in
the
meantime
ches
on
the
burro
got
around
the
turn
of
the
trail
suddenly
the
boy
set
up
a
shout
of
excitement
oh
mister
he
yelled
with
a
string
of
profanity
his
promise
forgotten
in
his
heat
come
quick
an
look
at
der
cat
come
quick
quick
quick
what

as
he
took
in
the
situation
on
a
ledge
about
fifty
feet
above
the
road
crouched
a
full
grown
mountain
lion
ears
back
eyes
furtively
glimpsing
every
avenue
of
escape
yaggering
at
the
intruders
savagely
the
small
boy
in
jim
felton
rose
on
the
instant
pelt
him
ches
pelt
him
he
cried
and
let
fly
the
rock
in
his
hand
by
way
of
illustration
a
wild
animal
seems
to
have
little
idea
of
a
missile
the
lion
held
his
ground
and
let
the
stone
strike
him
in
the
side
then
with
a
screech
like
the
vital
principle
of
forty
thousand
tom
cat
fights
a
screech
that
left
a
sediment
in
the
lip
meditatively
let
me
see
one
of
those
mexican
mines
is
nt
it
or
wait
a
moment
shrewdly
i
may
have
mines
on
the
brain
because
we
ve
been
talking
about
them
upon
my
word
hayden
his
face
flushing
with
shame
his
professional
pride
sadly
wounded
i
m
awfully
sorry
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
ca
nt
just
put
my
finger
on
it
yet
somewhere
lately
i
ve
heard
of
it
did
i
read
of
it
or
hear
people
speaking
of
it
he
drew
his
hand
over
his
brow
looking
really
worried
come
on
and
walk
down
the
avenue
with
me
he
said
maybe
the
night
air
will
refresh
my
memory
and
i
ll
be
able
to
think
it
out
could
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
potent
factor
in
restoring
penfield
s
recollections
for
they
walked
some
distance
and
he
had
succeeded
in
offering
no
answer
to
hayden
s
question
and
although
he
strove
lightly
to
discuss
the
various
topics
which
arose
between
them
he
was
manifestly
so
perturbed
and
dismayed
that
hayden
felt
his
contempt
mitigated
by
a
faint
touch
of
pity
finally
when
about
to
cross
from
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
other
they
paused
to
give
an
oncoming
motor
the
right
of
way
as
it
went
flying
past
them
a
woman
leaned
forward
and
bowed
and
smiled
it
was
the
lady
of
the
butterflies
and
in
the
white
light
of
the
electric
lamp
hayden
saw
seated
beside
her
the
same
gray
elderly
unobtrusive
man
with
whom
she
had
entered
the
gildersleeve
by
george
marcia
oldham
cried
penfield
marcia
oldham
what
a
coincidence
what
luck
hayden
exulted
so
kitty
s
fairy
princess
and
his
fairy
princess
were
identical
it
was
surely
one
of
the
should
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
cousinly
affection
of
which
she
was
always
assuring
him
you
know
her
of
course
asked
penfield
i
have
recently
met
her
replied
hayden
briefly
queer
thing
about
that
family
meditated
penfield
queer
how
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
hayden
involuntarily
although
he
bitterly
reproached
himself
a
moment
later
for
having
as
he
expressed
it
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
ask
any
questions
of
penfield
penfield
chuckled
an
arid
biting
chuckle
it
was
too
his
face
brightened
up
his
crestfallen
manner
merged
happily
into
jauntiness
his
self
respect
was
restored
he
was
again
the
authoritative
gossip
you
know
of
course
of
old
oldham
one
of
the
millionaires
of
the
last
decade
well
with
changing
times
changing
methods
of
finance
he
lost
his
grip
and
about
five
years
ago
he
died
heavily
involved
leaving
a
widow
and
one
young
daughter
marcia
regime
and
was
a
pretty
absolutely
helpless
creature
and
marcia
was
still
at
school
of
course
it
raised
a
storm
of
talk
they
had
been
used
to
every
luxury
all
the
ease
of
wealth
they
relied
on
the
machinery
you
know
to
look
after
them
and
it
never
entered
into
their
heads
that
the
wheels
could
stop
when
they
did
stop
as
you
can
imagine
every
one
was
discussing
the
poor
oldhams
there
was
the
greatest
raising
of
hands
and
lowering
of
voices
and
mopping
of
eyes
whenever
their
names
were
mentioned
his
arid
chuckle
seemed
to
strike
hayden
like
the
spatter
of
hail
what
will
become
of
them
what
can
they
do
a
helpless
woman
like
mrs
oldham
and
a
young
daughter
he
mimicked
feminine
voices
you
heard
that
sort
of
thing
bleated
on
every
side
all
the
women
advanced
positive
opinions
on
just
what
they
ought
to
do
the
consensus
i
believe
amounted
to
the
oldhams
to
sell
everything
they
had
left
and
depart
for
some
obscure
german
or
french
town
where
marcia
might
perfect
herself
in
the
languages
and
fit
herself
for
a
nursery
governess
or
something
of
that
kind
but
again
a
fit
of
laughing
which
almost
choked
him
to
the
disapproval
even
horror
and
disgust
of
all
kind
friends
the
eccentric
oldhams
did
nothing
of
the
kind
they
went
along
as
they
always
had
and
certainly
they
did
not
then
display
nor
ever
have
displayed
any
lack
of
money
they
live
simply
entertain
very
little
but
marcia
who
is
considered
a
beauty
goes
out
constantly
she
is
seen
everywhere
dresses
quite
as
well
as
her
school
friends
kitty
hampton
and
bea
habersham
with
whom
she
always
appears
and
who
as
of
course
you
know
have
both
married
enormous
amounts
of
money
her
extravagance
is
hardly
discreet
considering
a
watchful
and
censorious
world
but
when
one
has
such
powerful
and
extremely
loyal
friends
discretion
is
unnecessary
indignantly
penfield
s
thin
laughter
stabbed
his
ear
drums
if
she
sold
in
a
year
all
the
pretty
little
pictures
she
paints
it
would
barely
pay
for
her
gowns
no
that
wo
nt
do
but
and
a
new
note
crept
into
penfield
s
voice
did
you
see
that
old
duffer
who
was
with
her
that
s
where
she
shows
her
discretion
he
is
kept
very
much
in
the
background
it
is
only
occasionally
that
she
appears
with
him
who
is
he
asked
hayden
gruffly
desperately
ashamed
of
himself
for
stooping
to
question
penfield
penfield
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
spread
his
hands
let
us
hope
that
he
is
the
rich
uncle
from
australia
he
said
gently
ah
hayden
bea
and
kitty
have
managed
the
affair
with
wilfred
ames
beautifully
so
far
they
have
almost
succeeded
in
pulling
it
off
in
spite
of
the
reluctant
lady
and
wilfred
s
raving
mother
but
wilfred
good
old
thick
witted
wilfred
is
becoming
daily
to
sleep
on
the
hearth
rug
as
kitty
and
bea
wish
him
to
on
the
contrary
owing
to
his
mother
s
watchful
vigilance
he
is
sniffing
around
quite
suspiciously
and
with
a
series
of
chuckles
i
believe
although
i
am
not
sure
yet
that
the
fair
marcia
has
a
rival
and
a
rival
to
be
reckoned
with
i
assure
you
hayden
felt
he
had
stood
all
that
he
could
penfield
really
was
too
offensive
his
first
impulse
was
to
turn
on
his
heel
and
leave
extremity
of
need
bright
ominous
accusing
she
seized
it
augustine
augustine
what
of
him
sir
hugh
s
voice
had
an
edge
to
it
he
could
not
bear
it
it
would
break
his
heart
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
he
is
nt
all
your
life
you
ve
given
him
most
of
it
already
he
is
he
must
be
all
my
life
except
that
beautiful
part
that
you
were
that
you
are
oh
you
will
stay
my
friend
i
ll
stay
your
lover
your
determined
lover
and
husband
amabel
darling
you
are
ridiculous
enchanting
with
your
barriers
your
scruples
her
fanned
his
ardour
to
flame
his
arms
once
more
went
round
her
he
murmured
words
of
lover
like
pleading
rapturous
wild
and
foolish
and
though
her
love
her
sacred
love
for
him
was
there
his
love
for
her
was
a
nightmare
to
her
now
she
had
lost
herself
and
it
was
as
though
she
lost
him
while
he
pleaded
thus
and
again
and
again
she
answered
resolute
and
tormented
no
no
never
never
do
not
speak
so
to
me
do
not
i
beg
of
you
suddenly
he
released
her
he
straightened
himself
and
moved
away
from
her
a
little
someone
had
entered
amabel
dropped
her
hands
and
raised
her
eyes
at
last
augustine
stood
before
them
augustine
had
on
still
his
long
travelling
coat
his
cap
beaded
with
raindrops
was
in
his
hand
his
yellow
hair
was
ruffled
he
had
entered
hastily
he
stood
there
looking
at
them
transfixed
yet
not
astonished
of
them
spoke
sir
hugh
did
not
move
further
from
his
wife
s
side
he
was
neither
anxious
nor
confused
but
his
face
wore
an
involuntary
scowl
the
deep
confusion
was
amabel
s
but
her
husband
had
released
her
no
longer
pleaded
and
with
the
lifting
of
that
dire
oppression
the
realities
of
her
life
flooded
her
almost
with
relief
it
was
impossible
this
gay
this
facile
this
unseemly
love
but
as
she
rejected
and
put
it
from
her
the
old
love
was
the
stronger
cherished
the
more
closely
in
atonement
and
solicitude
the
man
shrunk
from
and
repulsed
and
in
all
the
deep
confusion
before
her
son
that
he
should
find
her
so
almost
in
her
husband
s
arms
a
flash
of
clarity
went
through
her
mind
as
she
saw
them
thus
confronted
deeper
than
ever
between
her
and
augustine
was
the
challenge
of
her
love
and
his
hatred
but
it
was
that
sacred
love
that
now
needed
safeguards
she
could
not
feel
was
her
refuge
from
oppression
she
rose
and
went
to
him
and
timidly
clasped
his
arm
dear
augustine
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
back
i
have
missed
you
so
he
stood
still
not
responding
to
her
touch
but
as
she
held
him
he
looked
across
the
room
at
sir
hugh
you
wrote
you
missed
me
that
s
why
i
came
sir
hugh
now
strolled
to
the
fire
and
stood
before
it
turning
to
face
augustine
s
gaze
unperturbed
quite
at
ease
how
wet
you
are
dear
said
amabel
take
off
this
coat
augustine
stripped
it
off
and
flung
it
on
a
chair
she
could
hear
his
quick
breathing
he
did
not
look
at
her
and
still
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
his
anger
rather
than
his
love
that
protected
her
he
will
want
to
change
dearest
said
sir
hugh
from
before
the
fire
and
i
want
to
finish
his
mother
at
the
blush
that
overwhelmed
her
as
that
possessive
word
was
spoken
do
you
want
me
to
go
no
dear
no
it
is
only
the
coat
that
is
wet
is
nt
it
do
nt
go
i
want
to
see
you
of
course
after
your
absence
hugh
you
will
excuse
us
it
seems
such
a
long
time
since
i
saw
him
you
and
i
will
finish
our
talk
on
another
day
or
i
will
write
to
you
she
knew
what
it
must
look
like
to
her
husband
this
weak
recourse
to
the
protection
of
augustine
s
presence
it
looked
like
bashfulness
a
further
feminine
wile
made
up
of
self
deception
and
allurement
a
putting
off
of
final
surrender
for
the
greater
sweetness
of
delay
and
as
the
reading
of
him
flashed
through
her
it
brought
a
strange
pang
of
shame
for
him
of
regret
for
something
spoiled
sir
hugh
took
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
come
back
for
me
at
five
fifteen
you
ll
give
me
some
tea
dearest
of
course
it
is
time
now
augustine
will
you
ring
the
miserable
blush
covered
her
again
the
tea
came
and
they
were
silent
while
the
maid
set
it
out
augustine
had
thrown
himself
into
a
chair
and
stared
before
him
sir
hugh
very
much
in
possession
kept
his
place
before
the
fire
catching
amabel
s
eye
he
smiled
at
her
he
was
completely
assured
how
should
he
not
be
what
for
his
seeing
could
stand
between
them
now
when
the
maid
was
gone
and
amabel
was
making
tea
he
came
and
stood
over
her
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
handsome
head
bent
to
her
talking
lightly
slightly
jesting
his
voice
pitched
intimately
for
her
ear
yet
not
so
intimately
that
any
unkindness
of
exclusion
should
appear
augustine
could
hear
all
he
said
and
gauge
how
deep
was
an
intimacy
that
could
wear
such
lightness
meanwhile
looked
at
neither
his
mother
nor
sir
hugh
turned
from
them
in
his
chair
he
put
out
his
hand
for
his
tea
and
stared
before
him
as
if
unseeing
and
unhearing
while
he
drank
it
it
was
for
her
sake
amabel
knew
that
sir
hugh
raising
his
voice
presently
as
though
aware
of
the
sullen
presence
made
a
little
effort
to
lift
the
gloom
what
sort
of
a
time
have
you
had
augustine
he
asked
was
the
weather
at
haversham
as
bad
as
everywhere
else
augustine
did
not
turn
his
head
in
replying
quite
as
bad
i
fancy
you
and
young
wallace
hammered
at
metaphysics
i
suppose
we
did
nice
lad
to
this
augustine
through
the
old
wicked
looking
streets
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
i
am
only
sorry
that
my
new
friends
my
french
family
do
not
live
in
the
old
city
au
coeur
du
vieux
paris
as
they
say
here
they
live
only
in
the
boulevard
haussman
which
is
less
picturesque
but
in
spite
of
this
they
have
a
great
deal
of
the
balzac
tone
madame
de
maisonrouge
belongs
to
one
of
the
oldest
and
proudest
families
in
france
but
she
has
had
reverses
which
have
compelled
her
to
open
an
establishment
in
which
a
limited
number
of
travellers
who
are
weary
of
the
beaten
track
who
have
the
sense
of
local
colour
she
explains
it
herself
she
expresses
it
so
well
in
short
to
open
a
sort
of
boarding
house
i
do
nt
see
why
i
should
not
after
all
use
that
expression
for
it
is
the
correlative
of
the
term
pension
bourgeoise
employed
by
balzac
in
the
madame
vauquer
nee
de
conflans
but
this
establishment
is
not
at
all
like
that
and
indeed
it
is
not
at
all
bourgeois
there
is
something
distinguished
something
aristocratic
about
it
the
pension
vauquer
was
dark
brown
sordid
graisseuse
but
this
is
in
quite
a
different
tone
with
high
clear
lightly
draped
windows
tender
subtle
almost
morbid
colours
and
furniture
in
elegant
studied
reed
like
lines
madame
de
maisonrouge
reminds
me
of
madame
hulot
do
you
remember
la
belle
madame
hulot
in
les
barents
pauvres
she
has
a
great
charm
a
little
artificial
a
little
fatigued
with
a
little
suggestion
of
hidden
things
in
her
life
but
i
have
always
been
sensitive
to
the
charm
of
fatigue
of
duplicity
i
am
rather
disappointed
i
confess
in
the
society
i
find
here
it
is
not
so
local
so
characteristic
as
i
could
have
desired
indeed
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
not
local
at
is
cosmopolitan
and
there
is
a
great
advantage
in
that
we
are
french
we
are
english
we
are
american
we
are
german
and
i
believe
there
are
some
russians
and
hungarians
expected
i
am
much
interested
in
the
study
of
national
types
in
comparing
contrasting
seizing
the
strong
points
the
weak
points
the
point
of
view
of
each
it
is
interesting
to
shift
one
s
point
of
view
to
enter
into
strange
exotic
ways
of
looking
at
life
the
american
types
here
are
not
i
am
sorry
to
say
so
interesting
as
they
might
be
and
excepting
myself
are
exclusively
feminine
we
are
thin
my
dear
harvard
we
are
pale
we
are
sharp
there
is
something
meagre
about
us
our
line
is
wanting
in
roundness
our
composition
in
richness
we
lack
temperament
we
do
nt
know
how
to
live
nous
ne
savons
pas
vivre
as
they
say
here
the
american
temperament
is
represented
putting
myself
not
at
all
american
by
a
young
girl
and
her
mother
and
another
young
girl
without
her
mother
without
her
mother
or
any
attendant
or
appendage
whatever
these
young
girls
are
rather
curious
types
they
have
a
certain
interest
they
have
a
certain
grace
but
they
are
disappointing
too
they
do
nt
go
far
they
do
nt
keep
all
they
promise
they
do
nt
satisfy
the
imagination
they
are
cold
slim
sexless
the
physique
is
not
generous
not
abundant
it
is
only
the
drapery
the
skirts
and
furbelows
that
is
i
mean
in
the
young
lady
who
has
her
mother
that
are
abundant
they
are
very
different
one
of
them
all
elegance
all
expensiveness
with
an
air
of
high
fashion
from
new
york
the
other
a
plain
pure
clear
eyed
straight
waisted
straight
stepping
maiden
from
the
heart
of
new
england
and
yet
they
are
very
much
alike
too
more
alike
than
they
would
care
to
think
themselves
for
they
eye
each
are
both
specimens
of
the
emancipated
young
american
girl
practical
positive
passionless
subtle
and
knowing
as
you
please
either
too
much
or
too
little
and
yet
as
i
say
they
have
a
certain
stamp
a
certain
grace
i
like
to
talk
with
them
to
study
them
the
fair
new
yorker
is
sometimes
very
amusing
she
asks
me
if
every
one
in
boston
talks
like
me
if
every
one
is
as
intellectual
as
your
poor
correspondent
she
is
for
ever
throwing
boston
up
at
me
i
ca
nt
get
rid
of
boston
the
other
one
rubs
it
into
me
too
but
in
a
different
way
she
seems
to
feel
about
it
as
a
good
mahommedan
feels
toward
mecca
and
regards
it
as
a
kind
of
focus
of
light
for
the
whole
human
race
poor
little
boston
what
nonsense
is
talked
in
thy
name
but
this
new
england
maiden
is
in
her
way
a
strange
type
she
is
travelling
all
over
says
for
herself
for
herself
what
can
that
stiff
slim
self
of
hers
do
with
such
sights
such
visions
she
looks
at
everything
goes
everywhere
passes
her
way
with
her
clear
quiet
eyes
wide
open
skirting
the
edge
of
obscene
abysses
without
suspecting
them
pushing
through
brambles
without
tearing
her
robe
exciting
without
knowing
it
the
most
injurious
suspicions
and
always
holding
her
course
passionless
stainless
fearless
charmless
it
is
a
little
figure
in
which
after
all
if
you
can
get
the
right
point
of
view
there
is
something
rather
striking
by
way
of
contrast
there
is
a
lovely
english
girl
with
eyes
as
shy
as
violets
and
a
voice
as
sweet
she
has
a
sweet
gainsborough
head
and
a
great
gainsborough
hat
with
a
mighty
plume
in
front
of
it
which
makes
a
shadow
over
her
quiet
english
eyes
then
she
has
a
sage
green
robe
mystic
wonderful
all
embroidered
with
subtle
devices
straight
and
tight
in
front
and
adorned
behind
along
the
spine
with
large
strange
iridescent
buttons
the
revival
of
taste
of
the
sense
of
beauty
in
england
interests
me
deeply
what
is
there
in
a
simple
row
of
spinal
buttons
to
make
one
dream
to
donnor
a
rever
as
they
say
here
i
think
that
a
great
aesthetic
renascence
until
the
great
day
comes
when
two
may
enter
it
together
as
theseus
carried
the
thread
of
ariadne
through
the
labyrinth
of
crete
there
are
many
who
attempt
to
find
the
secret
chamber
but
vainly
for
the
thread
will
always
break
in
the
wrong
heart
when
the
door
is
opened
way
through
the
devious
passages
there
is
so
little
to
be
seen
that
sometimes
even
the
man
himself
laughs
the
woman
to
scorn
and
despoils
her
of
her
few
treasures
the
secret
chamber
is
only
a
bare
white
room
where
is
erected
the
high
altar
of
her
soul
served
through
life
by
her
own
faith
upon
the
altar
burns
steadfastly
the
one
light
waiting
for
him
who
at
last
has
come
and
consecrated
in
his
name
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
is
rock
ribbed
and
heavy
and
he
who
has
not
the
key
may
beat
and
call
in
vain
while
within
unheeding
the
woman
guards
her
light
pitifully
often
the
man
does
not
care
sometimes
he
does
not
even
suspect
that
he
has
been
admitted
into
the
inmost
sanctuary
of
her
heart
for
there
are
men
who
may
never
know
what
sanctuary
means
nor
what
the
opening
of
the
door
has
cost
but
the
man
who
is
worthy
will
kneel
at
the
altar
for
a
moment
with
the
woman
beside
him
and
him
he
may
go
in
sometimes
with
her
to
warm
his
hands
at
those
divine
fires
and
kindle
his
failing
courage
anew
when
the
sanctuary
is
not
profaned
by
him
who
has
come
hither
its
blessedness
is
increased
ten
fold
it
takes
on
a
certain
divinity
by
being
shared
and
thereafter
they
serve
the
light
together
and
yet
through
woman
s
eager
trustfulness
the
man
who
opens
the
door
is
not
always
the
one
divinely
appointed
to
open
it
sometimes
the
light
fails
and
the
woman
weeping
in
the
darkness
is
left
alone
in
her
profaned
temple
never
to
open
its
door
again
or
after
many
years
to
set
another
light
high
upon
the
altar
and
in
the
deepening
shadows
pray
so
because
the
door
had
never
been
opened
and
because
she
knew
the
man
had
come
at
last
who
might
enter
the
sanctuary
with
her
rose
lifted
her
ever
burning
light
that
night
to
the
high
altar
of
her
soul
and
set
herself
to
wait
until
son
the
house
seemed
very
quiet
though
steadily
from
a
distant
upper
room
came
the
sound
of
a
violin
for
more
than
an
hour
allison
had
worked
continuously
at
one
difficult
phrase
colonel
kent
smiled
whimsically
as
he
sat
in
the
library
thinking
that
by
this
time
he
could
almost
play
it
himself
looking
back
over
the
thirty
years
he
could
see
where
he
had
made
mistakes
in
moulding
the
human
clay
entrusted
to
his
care
yet
in
the
end
the
mistakes
had
not
mattered
back
in
the
beginning
he
had
formulated
certain
cherished
ideals
for
his
son
and
had
worked
steadily
toward
them
unmindful
of
occasional
difficulties
and
even
failures
against
his
own
judgment
he
had
yielded
to
francesca
in
the
choice
of
the
boy
s
career
look
at
his
hands
she
had
said
you
could
nt
put
hands
like
his
at
work
in
an
office
if
he
is
nt
meant
for
music
we
ll
find
it
out
soon
enough
chosen
path
with
never
a
question
or
doubt
of
his
ultimate
success
just
now
the
colonel
was
deeply
grateful
to
francesca
for
the
years
abroad
had
been
pleasant
ones
and
would
have
been
wholly
impossible
had
allison
been
working
in
an
office
with
a
sigh
he
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
through
the
hall
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
grey
head
bowed
before
him
was
his
own
portrait
in
uniform
his
hand
upon
his
sword
the
sword
itself
hanging
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
was
dull
and
lifeless
now
he
had
a
curious
sense
that
his
work
was
done
the
tiny
stream
rising
from
some
cool
pool
among
the
mountains
is
not
unlike
man
s
own
beginning
for
at
first
it
gives
no
hint
of
its
boundless
possibilities
grown
to
a
river
taking
to
itself
the
water
from
a
thousand
secret
channels
it
leaps
down
the
mountain
heedless
of
rocky
barriers
with
all
the
joy
of
lusty
youth
the
its
accumulation
of
driftwood
its
unsuspected
depths
and
its
crystalline
shallows
singing
in
the
summer
sun
barriers
may
be
built
across
its
path
but
they
bring
only
power
as
the
conquering
of
an
obstacle
is
always
sure
to
do
sometimes
when
the
rocks
and
stone
clad
hills
loom
large
ahead
and
eternity
itself
would
be
needed
to
carve
a
passage
there
is
an
easy
way
around
the
discovery
of
it
makes
the
river
sing
with
gladness
and
turns
the
murmurous
deeps
to
living
water
bright
with
ripples
and
foam
ultimately
too
in
spite
of
rocks
and
driftwood
of
endless
seeking
for
a
path
of
tempestuous
nights
and
days
of
ice
and
snow
man
and
the
river
reach
the
eternal
sea
to
be
merged
forever
with
the
everlasting
upstairs
the
music
ceased
a
door
opened
then
closed
and
presently
allison
came
down
rubbing
his
hands
it
s
a
little
cool
up
there
he
said
and
yet
by
the
calendar
it
s
even
then
we
would
nt
be
satisfied
the
colonel
returned
who
wants
all
his
days
to
be
alike
nobody
still
it
s
a
bit
trying
to
freeze
your
nose
one
day
and
be
obliged
to
keep
all
the
windows
open
the
next
there
was
a
long
pause
the
colonel
tapped
his
fingers
restlessly
upon
the
library
table
allison
went
over
to
the
open
fire
and
stood
with
his
back
to
it
clasping
his
hands
behind
him
what
have
you
been
doing
all
the
morning
dad
nothing
just
sitting
here
thinking
pretty
hopeless
occupation
unless
you
have
something
in
particular
to
think
about
it
s
better
to
have
nothing
to
think
about
than
to
be
obliged
to
think
of
something
unpleasant
is
nt
it
i
do
nt
know
know
a
dead
cat

fetch
him
as
timmy
passed
the
box
on
the
way
out
he
looked
at
the
cat
with
renewed
interest
he
began
to
have
a
slight
doubt
that
he
might
not
know
a
dead
cat
when
he
saw
one
after
all
if
flannery
was
going
to
have
a
veterinary
come
to
look
at
it
but
the
cat
certainly
looked
dead
extremely
dead
doc
pomeroy
was
a
tall
lank
man
with
a
slouch
in
his
shoulders
and
a
sad
hollow
chested
voice
his
voice
was
the
deepest
and
mournfullest
bass
the
boy
says
you
want
me
to
look
at
a
cat
he
said
in
his
hopeless
tone
where
s
the
cat
and
doc
pomeroy
stood
at
the
other
side
he
did
not
even
bend
down
to
look
at
the
cat
that
cat

dead
he
said
without
emotion
av

there
a
moment
much
obliged
he
said
but
he
did
not
look
at
the
cat
again
he
went
back
to
his
headquarters
that
afternoon
flannery
and
timmy
began
walking
quickly
when
they
passed
the
box
and
toward
evening
when
flannery
had
to
make
out
his
reports
he
went
out
on
the
back
porch
and
wrote
them
using
a
chair
seat
for
a
desk
one
of
his
tasks
was
to
write
a
letter
to
the
new
york
office
w
b
he
wrote
the
vetinnary

says

sine
of
mrs
warman
yet

a
diseased
cat
i
nevver
fed
a
diseased
cat
yet
what
do
you
feed
cats
lik
that
the
next
morning
when
flannery
reached
the
office
he
opened
the
front
door
and
immediately
closed
it
with
as
usual
flannery
stood
a
minute
looking
at
the
door
and
then
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
to
wait
for
timmy
the
boy
came
along
after
a
while
indolently
as
usual
but
when
he
saw
flannery
he
quickened
his
pace
a
little
what
s
th
matter
he
asked
locked
out
flannery
stood
up
he
did
not
even
say
good
morning
he
ran
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
key
timmy
he
said
gently
almost
lovingly
i
have
business
that
takes
me

th
other
side
av
town

have
th
confidence
in
ye
timmy
t
let
ye
open
up
th
office
t
will
be
good
ixperience
fer
ye
he
cast
his
eye
down
the
street
where
the
car
line
made
a
turn
around
the
corner
the
trolley
wire
was
shaking
th
way
ye
open
up
he
said
slowly
is
t
push
th
key
in
timmy
an
thin
turrn
it
t
th
lift

he
called
as
timmy
turned

t
th
lift
not

right
an
whin
ye
have
th
door
open
the
car
was
rounding
the
corner
and
flannery
stepped
into
the
street
whin
ye
have
th
door
open
th
door
open
the
car
was
where
he
could
touch
it
take
th
cat
out
behind
th
office
an
bury
it
an
if
ye
do
nt
i
ll
fire
ye
out
av
yer
job
mind
that
the
car
sped
by
and
flannery
swung
aboard
timmy
watched
it
until
it
went
out
of
sight
around
the
next
corner
and
then
he
turned
to
the
office
door
he
pushed
the
key
in
and
turned
it
to
the
left
when
flannery
returned
the
cat
was
gone
and
so
was
timmy
the
grocer
next
door
handed
flannery
the
he
opened
the
door
of
the
office
and
for
a
moment
he
was
sure
the
cat
was
not
gone
but
it
was
flannery
could
not
see
the
box
it
was
gone
he
threw
open
the
back
door
and
let
the
wind
sweep
through
the
office
and
it
blew
a
paper
off
the
desk
flannery
picked
it
up
and
read
it
it
was
from
timmy
mike
flannery
esquire
it
said
take
youre
old
job
im
tired
of
the
express
bisiness
too
much
cats
and
missus
warmans
in
it
im
going
to
new
york
to
look
for
a
decent
job
i
berried
the
cat
for
you
but
no
more
for
me
youres
you
pray
for
i
said
oh
lord
do
not
make
me
rich
but
place
me
next
to
the
rich
and
he
kept
on
his
way
rubbing
his
hands
and
chuckling
and
yet
i
must
say
it
is
worth
the
price
i
have
no
need
of
a
william
here
nor
of
anybody
else
the
water
for
my
cups
is
within
my
reach
convenient
umbrellas
on
movable
pedestals
can
be
shoved
into
place
a
sheltered
back
porch
hives
for
the
night
all
my
paraphernalia
and
unfinished
sketches
and
a
step
lobster
fresh
from
the
sea
and
a
peculiar
peach
ablaze
in
a
peculiar
sauce
the
whole
washed
down
by
a
pint
of
no
you
ca
nt
have
the
brand
there
were
only
seven
bottles
left
when
i
paid
my
bill
and
besides
i
am
going
back
help
to
ease
the
cares
that
beset
a
painter
s
life
but
even
this
oasis
of
a
garden
hemmed
about
as
if
by
the
froth
of
trouville
and
the
suds
of
cabourg
through
which
floats
the
gay
life
of
paris
resplendent
in
toilets
never
excelled
or
exceeded
anywhere
can
not
keep
me
from
holland
very
long
and
it
is
a
pity
too
for
of
late
years
i
have
been
looked
upon
as
a
harmless
fixture
at
the
inn
so
much
so
that
men
and
women
pass
and
repass
my
easel
or
look
over
my
shoulder
while
i
work
without
a
break
in
their
confidences
quite
as
if
i
was
a
deaf
dumb
and
blind

the
cockatoo
who
has
for
the
past
thirty
years
none
of
these
unconscious
ear
droppings
am
i
going
to
betray
delightful
startling
improper
if
you
must
have
it
as
some
of
them
were
not
the
most
interesting
at
all
events
for
i
promised

would

but
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
diversion
obtained
by
keeping
the
latch
string
of
your
ears
on
the
outside
none
of
all
this
ever
drips
into
my
auricles
in
holland
a
country
so
small
that
they
build
dikes
to
keep
the
inhabitants
from
being
spilt
off
the
edge
is
hardly
the
place
for
a
scandal
certainly
not
in
stolid
dordrecht
or
in
that
fly
speck
of
a
papendrecht
whose
dormer
windows
peer
over
the
edge
of
the
dike
as
if
in
mortal
fear
of
another
inundation
and
yet
small
as
it
is
it
is
still
big
enough
for
me
to
approach
it
the
fly
speck
of
course
by
half
a
dozen
different
routes
i
can
come
by
boat
from
rotterdam
fop
smit
owns
and
runs
it
or
by
train
from
amsterdam
or
by
carriage
from
any
number
of
dams
drechts
and
bergs
or
i
can
tramp
it
on
foot
or
be
wheeled
in
on
a
dog
wagon
i
have
tried
them
all
and
know
being
now
a
staid
old
painter
and
past
such
foolishness
i
take
the
train
toot
toot
and
i
am
out
on
the
platform
through
the
door
of
the
station
and
aboard
the
one
horse
tram
that
wiggles
and
swings
over
the
cobble
scoured
streets
of
dordrecht
and
so
on
to
the
bellevue
why
i
stop
at
the
bellevue
apart
from
it
being
one
of
my
inns
is
that
from
its
windows
i
can
not
only
watch
the
life
of
the
tawny
colored
boat
crowded
maas
but
see
every
curl
of
smoke
that
mounts
from
the
chimneys
of
papendrecht
strung
along
its
opposite
bank
my
dear
friend
herr
boudier
of
years
gone
by
has
retired
from
its
ownership
but
his
successor
herr
teitsma
is
as
hearty
in
pulled
his
last
oar
some
two
years
back
and
one
bop
takes
his
place
there
is
another
p
and
an
e
tacked
on
to
bop
but
i
have
eliminated
the
unnecessary
and
call
him
bob
for
short
they
made
bob
out
of
what
was
left
of
peter
but
they
left
out
all
trace
of
william
this
wooden
shod
curiosity
is
anywhere
from
seventy
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
gray
knock
kneed
bent
in
the
back
and
goes
to
sleep
standing
up
and
stays
asleep
he
is
the
exact
duplicate
of
the
tramp
in
the
comic
opera
of
miss
hook
of
holland
except
that
the
actor
sleeper
occasionally
topples
over
and
has
to
be
braced
up
bob
is
past
master
of
the
art
and
goes
it
alone
without
propping
of
any
kind
he
is
the
only
man
in
dordrecht
or
papendrecht
or
the
country
round
about
who
can
pull
a
boat
and
speak
english
he
says
so
and
i
am
forced
not
he
wants
it
in
advance
too
having
had
some
experience
with
painter
man
he
explains
to
herr
teitsma
i
shall
of
course
miss
my
delightful
william
but
i
am
accustomed
to
that
and
then
again
while
bob
asleep
is
an
interesting
physiological
study
bob
awake
adds
to
the
gayety
of
nations
samples
of
which
crowd
about
my
easel
holland
being
one
of
the
main
highways
of
the
earth
i
have
known
dort
and
the
little
drecht
across
the
way
for
some
fifteen
years
five
of
which
have
slipped
by
since
i
last
opened
my
umbrella
along
its
quaint
quays
to
my
great
joy
nothing
has
changed
the
old
potato
boat
still
lies
close
to
the
quay
under
the
overhanging
elms
the
same
dear
old
man
and
his
equally
dear
old
wife
still
make
their
home
beneath
its
hipped
roof
i
know
for
it
is
here
i
lunch
the
cargo
forming
the
chief
dish
followed
by
a
saucer
of
stewed
currants
a
cup
of
coffee
of
bread
from
the
baker
s
the
old
groote
kirk
still
towers
aloft
the
highest
building
in
holland
they
say
the
lazy
red
sailed
luggers
drift
up
and
down
their
decks
gay
with
potted
plants
swiss
curtains
at
the
cabin
windows
the
wife
holding
the
tiller
while
the
man
trims
the
sail
the
boys
still
clatter
over
the
polished
cobbles
an
aggressive
mob
when
school
lets
out
and
a
larger
crop
i
think
than
in
the
years
gone
by
possibility
of
further
conversation
just
then
and
as
soon
as
the
curtain
was
down
and
the
applause
had
ceased
stephen
langdon
left
his
chair
and
reached
for
his
coat
and
hat
then
he
addressed
the
two
young
if
you
two
youngsters
care
to
see
this
out
i
ll
leave
you
here
together
he
said
i
have
just
remembered
something
i
should
have
attended
to
to
night
i
must
see
melvin
my
lawyer
you
wo
nt
mind
beatrice
will
you
if
i
leave
you
in
roderick
s
care
possibly
i
ll
return
before
the
show
is
out
before
either
of
them
could
answer
langdon
had
passed
out
into
the
aisle
and
hurried
away
leaving
duncan
and
miss
brunswick
alone
together
in
the
box
if
roderick
duncan
had
really
desired
an
opportunity
to
confide
his
troubles
to
beatrice
it
was
afforded
him
then
but
now
that
it
was
at
hand
he
felt
suddenly
uncertain
about
the
wisdom
of
such
a
proceeding
chapter
iv
the
box
at
the
opera
duncan
stared
helplessly
at
the
spot
where
the
curtains
had
fallen
together
behind
the
departing
figure
of
stephen
langdon
then
he
turned
his
eyes
toward
beatrice
to
discover
that
she
was
convulsed
with
laughter
but
levity
had
been
excited
by
the
departure
of
the
banker
or
by
duncan
s
attitude
of
dismay
the
young
man
could
not
have
told
he
laughed
with
her
for
there
was
a
distinctly
ludicrous
side
to
the
situation
following
as
it
did
so
closely
upon
the
announcement
of
his
engagement
to
patricia
by
mutual
consent
they
withdrew
to
the
rear
of
the
box
and
then
beatrice
with
a
touch
of
teasing
witchery
in
her
voice
and
with
laughter
still
in
her
eyes
asked
him
do
nt
you
think
that
this
is
rather
a
compromising
situation
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
have
only
just
become
engaged
to
patricia
really
you
know
it
is
dreadful
is
nt
it
i
had
nt
thought
of
that
he
replied
quite
truthfully
i
was
thinking
of
what
langdon
said
when
he
left
us
it
recalled
something
about
leaving
us
two
youngsters
alone
together
she
asked
him
with
no
that
was
nt
the
last
thing
he
said
what
was
it
i
did
nt
hear
it
he
said
he
was
going
to
see
melvin
i
suppose
you
know
who
melvin
is
do
nt
you
oh
yes
indeed
mr
melvin
and
i
are
great
friends
i
think
he
is
about
the
nicest
old
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
do
nt
you
he
is
what
i
should
call
the
arbiter
elegantiarum
of
the
langdon
court
if
one
could
imagine
old
steve
as
a
caesar
and
patricia
as
beatrice
paused
and
flushed
hotly
she
had
not
considered
to
what
length
her
words
were
reaching
she
had
almost
cast
a
reflection
upon
her
friend
which
would
have
been
as
unkind
as
it
was
unmerited
she
added
quickly
but
why
if
i
may
ask
did
the
mention
of
mr
melvin
s
name
interest
you
duncan
gazed
at
his
companion
rather
stupidly
for
a
moment
for
his
mind
had
suddenly
he
had
forgotten
for
the
time
being
where
he
was
and
with
whom
he
was
talking
but
beatrice
s
smile
and
the
mockery
in
her
eyes
brought
him
back
to
the
present
i
remembered
that
i
should
have
gone
myself
to
see
melvin
to
night
he
told
her
quietly
it
really
was
quite
important
i
should
have
sought
him
instead
of
coming
here
indeed
beatrice
laughed
brightly
mr
melvin
seems
to
be
in
great
demand
are
you
and
patricia
to
follow
the
french
fashion
of
drawing
the
marriage
contract
and
is
mr
melvin
to
act
the
part
of
a
french
notary
there
was
a
touch
of
irony
in
her
question
a
little
shaft
of
sarcasm
that
brought
a
quick
flush
to
duncan
s
face
he
was
reminded
instantly
of
the
tentative
betrothal
with
patricia
and
his
misgivings
concerning
it
beside
him
was
seated
the
one
person
who
might
aid
them
both
and
with
sudden
resolution
acted
upon
as
quickly
as
of
miss
brunswick
s
hands
holding
it
between
both
his
own
beatrice
he
said
with
quiet
emphasis
you
have
always
been
a
good
fellow
if
ever
there
was
a
girl
born
in
the
world
who
was
one
i
wonder
if
you
could
be
persuaded
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
advice
and
possibly
your
active
assistance
she
flushed
a
little
under
the
praise
and
the
intimately
personal
request
that
came
with
it
but
he
did
not
notice
this
as
he
went
on
i
ve
somehow
got
things
into
the
biggest
kind
of
a
muddle
to
day
and
i
have
a
notion
to
tell
you
all
about
it
i
have
the
impulse
to
take
you
into
my
confidence
and
to
ask
you
to
help
me
out
i
know
you
can
do
it
by
jove
beatrice
i
think
you
are
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
can
do
it
will
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
ever
so
little
and
the
flush
left
her
cheeks
suddenly
came
home
to
her
that
he
was
asking
a
favor
that
might
prove
extremely
difficult
to
grant
i
can
not
say
as
to
that
until
i
hear
what
you
wish
me
to
do
she
replied
i
want
you
to
help
me
square
myself
he
said
quickly
to
square
yourself
she
raised
her
brows
in
assumed
surprise
with
whom
why
with
patricia
of
course
help
you
to
square
yourself
with
patricia
she
laughed
outright
but
without
mirth
i
am
afraid
i
do
nt
at
all
understand
you
roderick
i
supposed
you
had
already
accomplished
that
much
for
you
told
me
did
you
not
that
patricia
has
just
accepted
you
yes
and
that
s
the
devil
of
it
was
the
unexpected
astounding
reply
beatrice
moved
farther
away
from
him
and
took
her
hand
from
his
grasp
in
well
simulated
horror
of
what
he
had
said
let
us
of
polite
society
she
said
with
mock
severity
we
will
leave
the
devil
out
of
it
if
you
please

you
