he
drew
forth
another
great
handful
of
gold
pennies
how
they
did
shine
but
as
marmaduke
reached
icicle
whip
and
again
they
rolled
over
the
edge
of
the
moon
and
again
marmaduke
was
too
eager
he
ran
after
them
and
wienerwurst
ran
too
and
when
they
reached
the
edge
they
could
nt
stop
themselves
at
all
they
were
falling
down
down
through
the
sky
a
hundred
somersaults
they
turned
marmaduke
tried
to
hold
on
to
a
cloud
but
his
hands
went
right
through
it
he
tried
to
hold
on
to
the
stars
but
he
missed
every
one
then
suddenly
bang
went
his
head
against
the
church
steeple
and
all
the
stars
danced
then
he
woke
he
looked
around
why
he
was
sitting
up
in
the
bed
his
very
own
bed
by
the
red
fire
it
was
just
a
trick
of
the
dream
fairy
s
after
all
but
it
was
all
right
for
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
rested
the
just
as
still
as
still
could
be
and
at
the
side
of
the
bed
stood
father
and
mother
and
the
toyman
they
seemed
very
happy
sixteenth
night
sloshin
of
course
marmaduke
grew
well
again
and
back
from
uncle
roger
s
came
jehosophat
and
hepzebiah
they
came
back
in
the
old
creaking
buckboard
with
methuselah
the
old
old
white
horse
and
the
toyman
no
sooner
had
they
jumped
to
the
ground
than
marmaduke
asked
very
proudly
where
do
you
think
i
ve
been
you
ve
been
sick
marmaduke
shook
his
head
that
s
not
what
i
mean
he
said
i
ve
been
to
see
the
old
man
in
the
moon
now
you
re
telling
stories
jeered
jehosophat
you
ve
just
been
in
bed
all
the
time
i
m
not
telling
any
stories
said
his
brother
stoutly
i
tell
you
i
have
been
to
visit
the
old
man
in
the
moon
but
jehosophat
would
nt
believe
him
that
s
his
friend
the
toyman
i
have
been
there
have
nt
i
where
said
the
toyman
to
see
the
old
man
in
the
moon
of
course
you
have
his
good
old
chum
replied
and
a
heap
of
wonderful
things
you
saw
the
toyman
never
laughed
at
the
wonderful
things
they
had
done
nor
at
the
marvellous
things
they
had
seen
no
never
for
he
understood
little
children
now
jehosophat
had
to
believe
him
he
asked
lots
of
questions
while
hepzebiah
listened
her
eyes
growing
as
round
as
big
peppermint
drops
so
marmaduke
showed
them
the
little
red
and
blue
sleigh
and
told
them
all
about
the
little
driver
jack
frost
and
he
did
nt
forget
about
old
black
eyed
susan
s
great
jump
nor
the
gold
pennies
either
jehosophat
felt
just
a
little
jealous
perhaps
that
is
why
he
was
naughty
that
day
and
this
is
how
it
all
happened
it
was
in
the
afternoon
jehosophat
was
coming
home
from
mile
a
long
way
from
the
toolong
where
the
three
happy
children
lived
with
him
walked
four
of
his
friends
sophy
soapstone
and
sammy
soapstone
who
lived
on
the
farm
by
the
old
canal
lizzie
fizzletree
who
lived
on
the
turnpike
and
fatty
hamm
who
lived
by
the
river
road
sammy
soapstone
had
blue
eyes
and
tow
hair
which
stood
up
straight
on
his
head
it
was
as
stiff
as
the
curry
comb
with
which
the
toyman
brushed
the
horses
sophy
soapstone
had
blue
eyes
too
and
two
neat
little
pigtails
down
her
back
but
lizzie
fizzletree
had
black
eyes
and
hair
that
stuck
out
in
all
directions
she
had
more
safety
pins
on
her
dress
than
a
neat
little
girl
should
ever
have
and
her
stockings
were
forever
coming
down
fatty
hamm
was
so
round
and
so
plump
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
pillows
under
his
clothes
and
though
he
was
only
twelve
he
had
two
chins
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
eat
so
much
that
a
button
would
pop
two
three
four
five
he
ate
he
did
not
offer
one
to
his
friends
not
even
the
core
another
apple
he
took
that
made
six
pop
went
a
button
and
splash
it
landed
in
a
puddle
of
brown
water
for
three
days
it
had
rained
washing
the
white
snow
away
the
ruts
in
the
road
were
full
of
these
puddles
nice
and
brown
and
inviting
sammy
s
eyes
and
jehosophat
s
eyes
followed
the
button
as
it
landed
in
the
water
making
little
rings
which
grew
larger
all
the
time
let
s
slosh
said
sammy
let
s
cried
lizzie
fizzletree
it
s
lots
of
fun
sloshin
into
a
big
puddle
marched
sammy
soapstone
and
after
him
marched
lizzie
and
sophy
and
at
the
end
of
the
procession
waddled
fatty
slop
slosh
slop
slosh
they
went
through
puddle
after
puddle
glorious
fun
it
was
showers
of
spray
flew
all
over
the
road
but
had
nt
his
mother
told
him
particularly
not
to
get
his
feet
wet
come
on
in
it
s
fine
they
all
shouted
at
jehosophat
aw
come
on
sammy
soapstone
repeated
and
fatty
called
fraidcat
at
that
jehosophat
turned
around
he
just
could
nt
stand
being
called
fraidcat
so
slosh
slosh
into
the
biggest
brown
puddle
he
could
find
he
went
slosh
slop
slop
slosh
over
his
rubber
tops
went
the
water
fine
and
cool
it
felt
splash
went
the
water
over
the
road
and
he
kicked
it
over
fatty
till
the
round
fat
legs
were
drenched
too
then
all
the
boys
bent
over
the
puddle
and
scooped
up
great
handfuls
of
water
and
threw
them
over
each
other
it
was
a
great
battle
and
when
it
was
finished
and
they
were
soaked
to
the
skin
they
splashed
up
the
road
shouting
and
singing
i
guess
they
went
into
every
side
of
the
road
they
had
reached
it
now
all
of
a
sudden
jehosophat
felt
very
funny
near
the
pit
of
his
stomach
something
was
sure
to
happen
now
in
front
of
the
of
his
car
he
recognized
her
as
the
weld
girl
s
matter
in
the
ditch
she
s
hurt
quick
whose
car
chug
was
scrambling
down
the
banks
hatton
s
angie
hatton
s
gosh
over
by
the
fence
where
she
had
been
flung
angie
hatton
was
found
sitting
up
dizzily
and
saying
betty
betty
in
what
a
whisper
i
m
all
right
dear
i
m
all
right
oh
angie
are
you
she
was
cut
and
bruised
and
her
wrist
had
been
broken
the
two
girls
clung
to
each
other
wordlessly
the
thing
was
miraculous
in
view
of
the
car
that
lay
perilously
tipped
on
its
fender
you
re
a
lucky
bunch
said
chug
who
was
driving
i
was
said
angie
hatton
it
was
nt
her
fault
the
weld
girl
put
in
quickly
we
were
coming
from
winnebago
she
s
a
wonderful
driver
we
met
a
farm
wagon
coming
toward
us
one
of
those
big
ones
the
middle
of
the
road
perhaps
he
was
asleep
he
did
nt
turn
out
we
thought
he
would
of
course
at
the
last
minute
we
had
to
try
for
the
ditch
it
was
too
steep
anyway
you
re
nervy
kids
both
of
you
i
ll
have
to
leave
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
car
in
the
road
till
morning
it
ll
be
all
right
he
did
get
them
home
in
twenty
minutes
and
the
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
car
was
still
lying
repentantly
in
the
ditch
when
morning
came
old
man
hatton
himself
came
into
the
garage
to
thank
chug
the
following
day
chug
met
him
in
overalls
smudge
faced
as
he
was
old
man
hatton
put
out
his
hand
chug
grinned
and
looked
at
his
own
grease
grimed
paw
that
s
all
right
said
old
man
hatton
and
grasped
it
firmly
want
to
thank
you
that
s
all
right
said
chug
did
nt
do
a
thing
no
business
driving
alone
that
hour
of
the
night
girls
nowadays
he
looked
around
the
garage
work
here
i
suppose
yessir
if
there
s
anything
i
can
do
for
you
over
at
the
mill
guess
not
said
fine
let
s
see
who
owns
this
place
i
do
old
man
hatton
s
face
broke
into
a
sunburst
of
laugh
wrinkles
he
threw
back
his
head
and
went
the
scale
from
roar
to
chuckle
one
on
me
pretty
good
have
to
tell
angie
that
one
chug
walked
to
the
street
with
him
your
daughter
she
s
got
a
lot
of
nerve
all
right
and
that
girl
with
her
weld
say
not
a
whimper
out
of
her
and
the
blood
running
down
her
face
she
all
right
cut
her
head
a
little
they
re
both
all
right
angie
would
nt
even
stay
in
bed
well
as
i
say
if
there
s
anything
chug
flushed
a
little
tell
you
what
mr
hatton
i
m
working
on
a
thing
that
ll
take
the
whine
out
of
the
daker
old
man
hatton
owned
the
daker
motor
plant
among
other
things
the
daker
not
much
for
looks
but
everything
in
the
engine
and
everyone
who
has
ever
owned
one
knows
that
its
only
fault
is
the
way
its
engine
moans
daker
owners
hate
that
moan
when
you
re
going
right
it
sounds
a
pass
between
a
peanut
roaster
and
a
banshee
with
bronchitis
every
engineer
in
the
daker
plant
had
worked
over
it
ca
nt
be
done
said
old
man
hatton
another
three
months
and
i
ll
show
you
hope
you
do
son
hope
you
do
but
in
another
three
months
chug
scaritt
was
one
of
a
million
boys
destined
to
take
off
a
pink
striped
shirt
a
nobby
belted
suit
and
a
long
visored
cap
to
don
a
rather
bob
tailed
brown
outfit
it
was
some
eighteen
months
later
before
he
resumed
the
chromatic
clothes
with
an
ardour
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
style
and
cut
but
in
the
interval
between
doffing
pink
striped
shirt
and
donning
pink
striped
shirt
no
need
to
describe
camp
sibley
two
miles
outside
chippewa
and
the
city
no
going
into
detail
concerning
the
effective
combination
formed
by
chug
and
a
machine
gun
these
things
were
important
and
interesting
but
perhaps
not
more
interesting
than
the
seemingly
unimportant
fact
that
in
july
following
that
april
chug
was
dancing
blithely
and
rhythmically
with
elizabeth
weld
and
saying
angie
hatton
s
a
smooth
little
dancer
all
right
but
she
is
nt
in
it
with
you
for
chippewa
somehow
had
fused
chippewa
had
forgotten
sets
sections
cliques
factions
and
parties
and
formed
a
community
it
had
figuratively
wiped
out
the
railroad
tracks
together
with
all
artificial
social
boundaries
chug
scaritt
in
uniform
must
be
kept
happy
he
must
be
furnished
with
wholesome
recreation
fun
amusement
entertainment
there
sprang
up
seemingly
overnight
a
great
wooden
hall
in
elm
street
on
what
had
been
a
vacant
lot
and
there
by
day
or
by
night
were
to
be
had
music
and
dancing
and
hot
cakes
and
girls
girls
girls
who
were
straight
and
slim
and
young
and
bright
eyed
and
companionable
girls
like
angie
hatton
girls
like
betty
weld
betty
weld
who
no
longer
sat
against
the
wall
at
the
golf
club
dances
and
prayed
in
her
heart
that
fat
old
oakley
was
nt
coming
to
ask
her
to
dance
betty
weld
was
so
popular
now
that
the
hostess
used
to
have
to
say
to
her
in
a
tactful
aside
my
dear
you
ve
danced
three
times
this
evening
with
the
scaritt
boy
you
know
that
s
against
the
rules
betty
knew
it
so
did
chug
betty
danced
so
lightly
that
chug
could
hardly
feel
her
in
his
arms
he
told
her
that
she
ran
sweet
and
true
like
the
engine
of
a
high
powered
car
and
with
as
little
apparent
effort
she
liked
that
and
understood
it
was
wonderful
how
she
understood
chug
had
never
known
that
girls
could
understand
like
that
she
talked
to
you
straight
looked
at
interested
you
no
waist
squeezing
here
no
cheap
banter
you
even
forgot
she

worse
the
nicht

clicking
of

the
woman

the
question

answer
my

very
tiring
for
you
nellie
oh
i
m

that
tired
she
replied
with
a
show
of
cheerfulness
as
she
turned
another
wire
in
the
sock
and
set
the
balls
of
wool
dancing
on
the
floor
with
the
speed
at
which
she
worked
i
ve
had
a
real
good
day
to
day
and
i
m
feeling
that
i
could
just
sit
for
a
lang
while
the
nicht
if
only
the
paraffin
oil
wadna
go
down
so
quick
but
the
longer
i
sit

more
and

silence
broken
only
by
the
loud
ticking
of
the
clock
the
clicking
of
the
needles
and
occasionally
a
low
moan
from
the
bed
as
the
injured
miner
sank
into
a
restless
sleep
there
had
been
an
accident
some
six
weeks
before
and
geordie
sinclair
badly
wounded
by
a
fall
of
stone
had
been
brought
home
from
the
pit
in
a
cart
it
was
during
the
time
known
to
old
miners
as
the
two
and
sixpenny
winter
that
being
the
sum
of
the
daily
wage
then
earned
by
the
miners
a
financial
crisis
had
come
upon
the
country
and
the
glasgow
city
bank
had
failed
trade
was
dull
and
the
whole
industrial
system
was
in
chaos
it
had
been
a
hard
time
for
geordie
sinclair
s
wife
for
there
were
four
children
to
provide
for
besides
her
injured
husband
work
which
was
well
paid
for
was
not
over
till
far
into
the
night
to
earn
the
bare
necessities
of
life
there
were
times
like
to
night
when
she
felt
rebellious
and
bitter
at
her
plight
but
her
tired
eyes
and
fingers
had
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
task
for
that
meant
bread
for
the
children
in
the
morning
the
silence
deepened
in
the
little
kitchen
no
sound
came
now
from
the
bed
and
the
lamp
threw
eerie
shadows
on
the
walls
and
the
chimney
smoked
incessantly
her
eyes
grew
watery
and
smarted
with
the
smoke
she
dropped
stitches
occasionally
as
she
hurried
with
her
work
which
had
to
be
lifted
again
when
she
discovered
that
the
pattern
was
wrong
and
sometimes
quite
a
considerable
part
had
to
be
ripped
out
so
that
she
could
correct
the
mistake
the
dismal
calling
of
a
cat
outside
irritated
her
and
the
loud
complacent
ticking
of
the
clock
seemed
to
mock
her
misery
but
still
she
worked
on
the
busy
fingers
turning
the
needles
as
the
wool
unwound
itself
from
the
in
those
balls
of
wool
as
they
spun
to
the
tune
of
the
woman
s
misery
they
advanced
and
retired
like
dancers
touching
hands
when
they
that
any
one
else
should
have
been
in
the
vicinity
without
lem
s
knowledge
it
was
quite
possible
that
lem
s
statement
of
the
hour
when
he
was
shot
was
incorrect
for
his
mind
could
hardly
yet
be
clear
enough
to
be
certain
without
doubt
of
details
lem
quickly
dropped
into
a
refreshing
sleep
and
doctor
joe
left
him
for
a
little
while
to
join
the
boys
out
of
doors
he
found
them
behind
the
house
picking
the
goose
indian
jake
had
left
in
the
tree
at
the
flat
point
camp
how
s
lem
sir
is
he
hurt
bad
david
asked
as
doctor
joe
seated
himself
upon
a
stump
he
s
sleeping
now
after
he
rests
a
little
we
ll
see
how
badly
he
s
hurt
said
about
dinner
hungry
already
i
ll
be
bound
aye
grinned
david
wonderful
hungry
t
is
most
noon
sir
doctor
joe
consulted
his
watch
i
declare
it
is
it
must
have
been
nearly
eleven
o
clock
when
we
reached
here
i
did
nt
realize
it
was
so
late
t
were
ten
minutes
to
eleven
sir
said
andy
i
were
lookin
to
see
how
long
it
takes
us
to
come
from
flat
p
int
what
time
did
we
leave
flat
point
asked
doctor
joe
t
were
twenty
minutes
before
seven
sir
andy
drew
his
new
watch
proudly
from
his
pocket
to
refer
to
it
again
as
he
did
upon
every
possible
occasion
no
corrected
david
t
were
only
twenty
five
minutes
before
eleven
when
we
leaves
flat
p
int
and
fifteen
minutes
before
eleven
when
we
gets
here
i
looks
to
see
perhaps
your
watches
suppose
we
compare
them
the
comparison
disclosed
a
difference
as
doctor
joe
predicted
of
five
minutes
then
each
must
needs
set
his
watch
with
doctor
joe
s
which
was
a
little
slower
than
andy
s
and
a
little
faster
than
david
s
doctor
joe
made
some
mental
calculations
both
david
and
andy
had
observed
their
watches
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
length
of
time
it
had
required
them
to
come
from
flat
point
to
lem
s
cabin
they
had
consumed
four
hours
but
their
progress
had
been
exceedingly
slow
indian
jake
had
doubtless
travelled
much
faster
in
his
light
canoe
but
at
best
with
the
wind
against
him
he
could
hardly
have
paddled
from
lem
s
cabin
to
flat
point
in
less
than
two
hours
he
had
arrived
one
hour
after
sunset
if
lem
were
correct
as
to
the
time
when
the
shooting
took
place
indian
jake
could
not
be
guilty
but
still
there
was
with
but
one
hour
or
possibly
a
little
more
in
excess
at
camp
an
uncertain
alibi
for
indian
jake
lem
may
have
been
shot
much
earlier
in
the
afternoon
than
he
supposed
when
lem
grew
stronger
it
would
be
necessary
to
question
him
closely
that
the
hour
might
be
fixed
with
certainty
whoever
had
shot
and
robbed
lem
must
have
known
of
the
existence
of
the
silver
fox
skin
and
been
familiar
with
the
surroundings
the
shots
had
doubtless
been
fired
through
a
broken
pane
in
a
window
directly
behind
the
chair
in
which
lem
was
sitting
at
the
time
why
not
cook
dinner
out
here
over
an
open
fire
doctor
joe
presently
suggested
you
chaps
are
pretty
noisy
and
if
you
come
into
the
house
to
cook
it
on
the
stove
i
m
afraid
you
ll
wake
lem
up
and
i
want
him
to
sleep
we
ll
cook
un
out
here
sir
david
agreed
t
is
more
fun
to
cook
here
jamie
suggested
very
well
when
it
s
ready
you
may
bring
lem
will
probably
be
awake
by
that
time
and
he
ll
want
something
too
stew
the
goose
so
that
there
ll
be
broth
and
we
ll
give
some
of
it
to
lem
to
drink
you
ll
have
to
go
to
fort
pelican
without
me
i
ll
have
to
stay
here
and
take
care
of
lem
if
the
wind
comes
up
and
i
think
it
will
you
may
get
a
start
after
dinner
and
doctor
joe
returned
to
the
cabin
to
watch
over
his
patient
the
goose
was
plucked
david
split
a
stick
of
wood
and
with
his
jack
knife
whittled
shavings
for
the
fire
the
knife
had
a
keen
edge
for
david
was
a
born
woodsman
and
every
woodsman
keeps
his
tools
always
in
good
condition
and
the
shavings
he
cut
were
long
and
thin
he
did
not
cut
each
shaving
separately
but
stopped
his
knife
just
short
of
the
end
of
the
stick
and
when
several
shavings
were
cut
with
a
twist
of
the
blade
he
broke
them
from
the
main
stick
the
butt
to
which
they
were
attached
he
whittled
four
or
five
of
these
bunches
of
shavings
and
then
cut
some
fine
splints
with
his
axe
david
was
now
ready
to
light
his
fire
he
placed
two
sticks
of
wood
upon
the
ground
end
to
end
in
the
form
of
a
right
angle
with
the
opening
between
the
sticks
in
the
direction
from
which
the
wind
came
taking
the
butt
of
one
of
the
bunches
of
shavings
in
his
left
hand
he
scratched
a
match
with
his
right
hand
and
lighted
the
thin
end
of
the
shavings
when
they
were
blazing
freely
he
carefully
placed
the
thick
end
upon
the
two
sticks
where
they
came
together
on
the
inside
of
the
angle
with
the
burning
end
resting
upon
the
ground
thus
the
thick
end
of
the
shavings
was
elevated
fire
always
climbs
upward
and
in
an
instant
the
whole
bunch
of
shavings
was
ablaze
upon
this
he
placed
the
other
shavings
the
thin
ends
on
the
fire
the
butts
resting
upon
the
two
had
previously
prepared
arranged
upon
this
they
quickly
ignited
and
upon
them
larger
sticks
were
laid
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
an
excellent
cooking
fire
was
ready
for
the
pot
before
disjointing
the
goose
david
held
it
over
the
blaze
until
it
was
thoroughly
singed
and
the
surface
of
the
skin
clear
water
and
her
breathing
was
distinctly
perceptible
sara
could
hear
it
too
and
it
sounded
like
the
ghost
of
a
dead
breeze
in
a
pine
top
as
soon
as
sara
could
take
her
ravished
eyes
from
the
sight
she
looked
down
to
see
what
was
nuzzling
about
her
shoe
buttons
and
just
as
she
had
suspected
it
was
the
snoodle
frisking
and
tumbling
and
rolling
about
her
feet
to
make
her
notice
him
and
indeed
when
he
was
awake
the
snoodle
was
irresistible
not
that
he
looked
like
anything
sara
had
ever
seen
before
he
might
perhaps
have
looked
like
a
dog
indeed
gave
him
a
haunting
resemblance
to
a
freshly
cooked
piece
of
macaroni
sara
was
later
to
find
out
the
reason
for
this
but
at
the
moment
she
was
puzzled
just
as
you
are
when
you
meet
a
stranger
who
looks
like
somebody
else
and
you
ca
nt
remember
who
else
it
is
and
his
head
which
was
not
very
clearly
defined
was
finished
off
with
a
neat
little
cap
that
looked
like
a
snail
shell
and
seemed
to
be
fastened
to
him
his
eyes
which
stuck
out
several
inches
in
front
of
his
face
on
long
prongs
were
delightfully
mischievous
and
confiding
and
he
was
covered
with
the
most
beautiful
snow
white
curly
hair
but
he
had
one
drawback
and
sara
discovered
that
when
she
started
to
pick
him
up
it
was
a
sort
of
little
window
in
the
exact
middle
of
his
back
with
an
ising
glass
cover
like
the
slide
cover
of
some
boxes
the
minute
you
touched
him
this
little
slide
drew
back
and
from
within
there
was
distinctly
perceptible
sara
could
even
smell
it
as
soon
as
she
did
so
she
herself
drew
back
and
contented
herself
with
looking
admiringly
at
the
confiding
playful
little
snoodle
as
she
stood
watching
his
pretty
antics
she
became
aware
that
the
snimmy
s
wife
had
stopped
her
work
and
was
watching
them
with
a
grim
smile
sara
saw
that
she
had
just
unscrewed
the
knob
of
the
prose
bush
and
was
still
holding
the
doorknob
and
the
corkscrew
in
her
hand
as
far
as
sara
could
tell
the
doorknob
seemed
as
neatly
hemmed
as
ever
so
overcome
by
curiosity
she
asked
the
snimmy
s
wife
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
it
this
is
the
day
to
unhem
it
she
answered
rather
glumly
i
unhem
it
every
pinkday
and
hem
it
every
lilyday
i
used
to
hem
it
only
oncet
a
month
but
avrillia
said
that
was
nt
civilized
and
whatever
she
says
goes
at
least
she
added
glancing
up
at
fountain
she
thinks
so
and
as
long
as
i
live
neighbor
to
her
it
s
sort
of
up
to
me
to
respect
her
standards
avrillia
ah
now
sara
remembered
she
had
meant
to
go
straight
to
find
pirlaps
and
avrillia
she
glanced
around
to
see
if
she
could
find
the
curly
little
path
but
she
could
not
really
start
until
she
had
asked
a
few
questions
about
the
darling
little
snoodle
is
is
nt
he
lovely
she
began
aware
of
a
vague
necessity
of
pleasing
the
wife
of
the
snimmy
if
one
wanted
to
find
out
anything
however
she
was
quite
honest
she
really
did
think
the
snoodle
was
lovely
except
for
his
drawback
you
think
so
answered
the
snimmy
s
wife
trying
hard
not
to
show
how
foolishly
pleased
she
really
was
he
s
the
only
child
we
have
if
sara
had
thought
a
minute
she
would
not
have
asked
the
next
question
certainly
not
of
so
formidable
a
person
as
the
snimmy
s
wife
eagerly
is
he
a
a
sort
of
dog
a
sort
of
dog
echoed
the
snimmy
s
wife
in
the
most
outraged
italics
a
kind
of
puppy
a
kind
of
puppy
said
the
snimmy
s
wife
in
perfectly
withering
small
capitals
then
she
said
in
the
loftiest
large
capitals
sara
had
ever
seen
his
mother
was
a
snail
she
held
the
world
s
record
for
slowness
and
his
father
was
a
pedigreed
noodle
sara
looked
at
him
in
awe
now
she
understood
the
cap
and
the
prongs
and
the
extreme
length
but
in
spite
of
the
snimmy
s
wife
s
indignant
mood
she
had
to
ask
one
more
question
but
you
said
he
was
your
child
was
the
way
she
put
it
i
did
nt
retorted
the
snimmy
s
wife
with
undisguised
contempt
i
said
he
was
the
only
child
we
have
we
have
him
have
nt
we
and
with
that
she
sat
and
curled
her
long
white
tail
around
the
base
with
quite
unnecessary
tightness
her
nose
was
not
quite
so
debilitating
as
the
snimmy
s
still
it
nearly
stuck
into
the
doorknob
as
she
hemmed
sara
saw
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
got
out
of
her
and
she
did
not
wish
to
pick
up
the
snoodle
on
account
of
his
drawback
so
she
decided
to
go
on
to
avrillia
s
without
further
delay
and
began
to
look
around
her
again
for
the
little
curly
path
it
was
pink
this
time
instead
of
curly
but
that
made
it
all
the
more
attractive
so
she
struck
into
it
at
once
and
went
skipping
happily
toward
the
arch
in
the
hawthorn
hedge
just
before
she
reached
it
she
heard
avrillia
s
thermometer
go
off
so
she
knew
that
she
was
on
the
right
path
the
minute
she
got
through
the
hedge
she
saw
avrillia
and
oh
loveliest
of
wonders
what
were
those
flying
around
her
hair
clinging
to
her
silken
skirts
playing
a
dainty
game
up
and
down
the
marble
stairs
oh
it
was
the
children
the
children
were
at
home
and
when
avrillia
saw
sara
she
came
toward
her
with
the
loveliest
look
of
welcome
the
children
hanging
all
around
her
like
rose
garlands
and
if
sara
had
loved
avrillia
the
day
before
she
could
simply
find
no
words
now
to
express
her
adoration
for
avrillia
knelt
down
among
the
shell
flowers
and
held
out
her
arms
which
permission
to
go
up
and
stay
at
temple
camp
before
the
season
opens
and
fell
some
of
those
trees
on
the
new
woods
property
and
put
up
three
cabins
on
the
hill
for
roy
and
the
troop
to
use
when
they
get
there
i
would
nt
want
anybody
to
know
i
m
doing
it
what
said
mr
burton
i
want
to
go
up
there
and
stay
and
put
up
three
cabins
said
tom
dully
humph
said
mr
burton
sitting
back
and
surveying
him
with
amused
and
frank
surprise
how
about
the
difficulties
that
s
the
only
thing
tom
said
i
was
thinking
it
all
over
and
the
only
difficulty
i
can
think
about
is
would
margaret
keep
it
a
secret
until
the
work
is
done
and
you
too
they
think
i
m
not
a
scout
any
more
and
i
m
going
to
show
them
if
you
think
i
ca
nt
do
it
you
ask
pete
the
janitor
and
if
i
see
the
hard
part
is
really
your
part
keeping
still
and
making
her
keep
still
i
see
said
mr
burton
contemplating
the
stolid
almost
expressionless
face
of
tom
and
trying
not
to
laugh
outright
my
part
is
easy
said
tom
chapter
xv
a
letter
from
barnard
when
tom
reached
temple
camp
he
found
a
letter
awaiting
him
there
it
was
stuck
up
among
the
antlers
of
uncle
jeb
s
moose
head
which
hung
in
the
old
camp
manager
s
cabin
he
found
uncle
jeb
alone
in
his
glory
and
mighty
glad
to
see
him
it
was
characteristic
of
the
old
western
scout
and
trapper
whom
mr
temple
had
brought
from
arizona
that
he
was
never
surprised
at
anything
if
a
grizzly
bear
had
wandered
into
camp
it
would
not
have
ruffled
him
in
the
least
he
would
have
surveyed
it
with
calm
shrewd
deliberation
taken
his
corncob
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
it
and
proceeded
to
business
if
the
grizzly
bear
safety
first
he
would
have
withdrawn
immediately
upon
the
ominous
sound
of
old
uncle
jeb
s
pipe
knocking
against
the
nearest
hard
substance
uncle
jeb
like
uncle
sam
moved
slowly
but
very
surely
it
was
not
altogether
uncommon
for
some
nature
loving
pilgrim
to
drop
in
at
camp
out
of
season
and
such
a
one
was
always
sure
of
that
easy
going
western
welcome
but
if
all
the
kings
and
emperors
in
the
world
or
such
few
of
them
as
are
left
had
dropped
in
at
camp
uncle
jeb
rushmore
would
have
eyed
them
keenly
puffed
some
awful
smoke
at
them
and
said
haow
doo
he
liked
people
but
he
did
not
depend
on
them
the
lake
and
the
trees
and
the
wild
life
talked
to
him
and
as
for
human
beings
he
was
always
glad
of
their
company
it
was
also
characteristic
of
uncle
jeb
that
no
adventurous
enterprise
no
foolhardy
daredevil
scheme
ever
caused
him
any
astonishment
mr
burton
engrossed
in
a
hundred
at
tom
s
plan
and
let
him
go
to
temple
camp
to
discover
its
absurdity
and
then
benefit
by
the
quiet
life
and
fresh
air
it
would
have
been
better
if
tom
had
been
sent
up
there
long
before
he
had
humored
him
by
promising
not
to
tell
and
he
was
glad
that
this
crazy
notion
about
the
cabins
had
given
tom
the
incentive
to
go
he
had
believed
that
tom
s
unfortunate
error
could
be
made
right
by
the
romantic
expedient
of
a
postage
stamp
mr
burton
was
not
a
scout
and
tom
slade
was
the
queerest
of
all
scouts
so
now
uncle
jeb
removed
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
said
reckoned
you
d
make
a
trip
up
hey
i
m
going
to
stay
here
alone
with
you
until
the
season
opens
tom
said
i
got
shell
shocked
i
ai
nt
any
good
down
there
i
assigned
our
three
cabins
to
a
troop
in
ohio
so
i
got
to
build
three
more
and
have
em
ready
on
the
hill
yer
ai
nt
cal
latin
on
trimming
yer
timbers
much
are
yer
uncle
jeb
asked
going
straight
to
the
practical
aspects
of
tom
s
plan
i
m
going
to
put
them
up
just
like
the
temporary
cabins
were
when
the
camp
first
opened
tom
said
ye
ll
find
some
of
them
same
logs
under
the
pavilion
uncle
jeb
said
enough
for
two
cabins
mebbe
why
doa
nt
you
put
up
four
and
let
that
peewee
kid
hev
one
all
by
hisself
do
you
think
i
can
do
it
in
six
weeks
tom
asked
i
ve
seed
a
injun
stockade
throwed
up
in
three
days
uncle
jeb
answered
me
n
general
custer
throwed
up
fort
bendy
in
two
nights
that
wuz
in
montanny
th
injuns
thought
we

heaven
but
we

nt
no
gods
as
i
told
the
general
leastways
i
was
n
n
never
wuz
but
i
had
a
sharp
axe
tom
said
but
i
wanted
it
to
be
a
stunt
as
you
might
say
tai
nt
no
stunt
uncle
jeb
said
who
s
writin
yer
from
out
in
ohio
i
see
the
postmark
tai
nt
them
kids
from
out
dayton
way
i
hope
tom
opened
the
letter
and
read
aloud
dear
tom
when
i
save
a
fellow
s
life
i
claim
the
right
to
call
him
by
his
first
name
even
if
i
ve
never
seen
him
if
anybody
ever
tells
me
again
that
the
world
is
a
big
place
i
ll
tell
them
it
s
about
the
size
of
a
shell
hole
no
bigger
and
that
s
small
enough
as
you
and
i
know
all
i
can
say
is
well
well
and
you
re
the
same
thomas
slade
and
the
funny
part
of
it
is
we
would
nt
know
each
other
if
we
met
in
the
street
that
s
because
we
met
in
a
shell
hole
made
inquiries
in
the
hospital
at
rheims
and
tried
to
get
a
line
on
you
from
the
red
cross
and
y
m
c
a
nothing
doing
somebody
to
be
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
their
more
and
more
deserving
nation
but
it
is
first
and
foremost
for
himself
and
his
family
he
has
a
burning
itching
desire
to
reign
everywhere
he
is
not
a
normal
man
physically
and
is
unbalanced
by
a
monumental
toolong
when
your
frau
is
so
busily
sewing
she
is
sewing
for
her
household
it
is
true
but
she
is
consciously
and
unconsciously
sewing
for
wilhelm
when
your
fraeulein
goes
out
to
her
etching
lesson
she
is
aware
of
being
of
the
magnificent
german
people
and
shares
a
part
of
the
national
ambition
to
excel
it
s
this
that
we
have
nt
got
in
america
and
ca
nt
well
have
under
our
system
but
it
s
this
unified
disciplined
zeal
that
enables
two
or
three
ordinary
germans
to
do
what
it
takes
four
ordinary
yankees
to
do
clad
in
armor
and
with
a
glistening
sword
in
hand
germania
ought
to
scare
but
kirtley
it
scares
me
i
feel
see
something
awful
coming
in
the
universal
german
hate
the
national
boundary
stops
any
flow
outward
of
sympathy
good
faith
equity
all
peoples
outside
are
human
insects
whom
it
is
proper
for
the
teuton
to
tread
on
if
he
can
crush
the
life
out
of
because
they
are
in
his
pathway
to
glory
kirtley
who
had
stared
at
his
new
friend
in
this
solemnity
turned
a
serious
face
toward
the
clawlike
branches
of
his
linden
in
its
gauntness
of
late
autumn
tide
this
meaning
of
the
animus
that
was
impelling
his
odd
and
yet
so
normal
german
household
he
began
to
see
was
substantiated
by
a
score
of
acts
and
attitudes
in
its
daily
life
he
scarcely
deemed
it
proper
to
tell
of
them
besides
he
did
not
want
to
fire
up
anderson
who
already
was
so
unsettled
so
comfortless
on
the
subject
but
kirtley
was
reasoning
out
how
this
animus
gave
a
solidity
a
solidarity
to
the
german
household
a
satisfied
any
such
incentive
was
almost
absent
in
the
american
family
and
so
wound
up
anderson
with
epigrams
the
years
will
be
left
humanity
to
weep
these
days
of
insouciance
and
neglect
you
can
see
that
germany
is
a
man
made
nation
it
is
not
the
kind
god
or
nature
would
make
god
must
have
turned
his
face
when
the
teuton
species
was
manufactured
germany
is
like
a
man
made
hot
air
register
when
it
is
nt
throwing
up
hot
air
it
is
throwing
up
cold
air
it
is
always
throwing
up
to
change
the
somewhat
painful
theme
kirtley
soon
began
i
do
nt
see
any
sports
such
as
we
know
them
in
germany
how
do
they
get
along
without
them
like
all
yankee
college
men
he
was
alert
on
these
lines
no
sports
in
deutschland
go
out
on
the
dresden
golf
links
of
a
morning
and
you
ll
find
hardly
a
german
soul
playing
it
s
the
same
in
vienna
the
same
in
berlin
they
have
links
because
it
s
go
out
on
the
highway
to
berlin
or
vienna
or
any
of
the
great
roads
and
you
will
seldom
meet
any
germans
touring
in
their
motors
for
pleasure
only
americans
english
the
germans
are
spoiling
little
time
by
such
matters
they
are
busy
busy
working
for
their
empire
busy
like
moles
boring
away
to
undermine
the
earth
busy
drilling
with
arms
so
you
see
no
sporting
terms
incorporated
in
their
daily
language
in
their
newspaper
language
such
as
we
see
in
england
and
america
terms
denoting
fair
play
square
deal
manly
courtesy
toward
the
under
dog
our
anglo
saxon
motto
do
nt
hit
him
when
he
s
down
is
no
motto
with
the
germans
they
think
that
s
just
the
time
to
hit
him
kick
him
when
he
s
flattened
out
kick
him
preferably
in
the
face
that
s
one
reason
so
many
teutons
have
scarred
faces
the
anglo
saxon
spirit
in
a
sporting
crowd
is
for
the
little
fellow
in
germany
it
s
for
the
big
fellow
the
fellow
who
already
has
everything
on
his
side
the
true
idea
and
fun
of
sport
take
away
its
knightliness
of
bearing
spirit
of
self
sacrifice
exhibition
of
pluck
though
defeat
is
certain
and
what
have
you
left
to
sport
about
it
merely
becomes
a
question
of
brute
force
overwhelming
force
you
have
cruelty
left
as
a
net
result
and
that
s
a
large
part
of
german
conduct
cruelty
to
underlings
or
to
those
who
are
feebler
or
caught
at
an
unfair
disadvantage
having
no
leaven
of
sports
is
one
thing
that
makes
the
german
life
seem
so
heavy
ominous
brutal
to
us
its
growling
rigidity
with
all
this
anderson
continued
gravely
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
old
men
are
mainly
in
the
saddle
in
germany
men
sixty
and
seventy
the
existence
and
influence
of
young
men
are
not
as
much
in
command
as
with
us
these
old
germans
have
disgruntled
stomachs
from
so
much
drinking
and
they
roar
about
physical
sports
mean
nothing
to
them
and
so
it
seems
sometimes
as
if
the
germans
are
born
old
helps
make
them
such
a
serious
race
the
most
serious
and
yet
people
insist
on
believing
that
this
serious
race
means
nothing
but
fun
by
all
its
military
preparations
where
s
the
logic
when
the
journalist
went
kirtley
let
him
through
the
wall
gate
with
its
weighted
rope
the
gate
flew
back
in
place
with
a
loud
report
as
if
to
give
emphasis
to
the
old
man
s
direful
interpretations
and
prophecies
chapter
xii
habits
and
children
in
spite
of
anderson
gard
could
not
make
up
his
mind
that
rudolph
was
anything
more
than
a
young
braggadocio
the
idea
of
an
ordinary
family
living
comfortably
along
with
a
spy
in
its
midst
ready
to
inform
on
them
and
their
guests
was
so
foreign
to
his
notions
so
caddish
that
it
weakened
his
confidence
in
his
compatriot
s
judgment
while
gard
felt
that
rudi
was
not
straight
he
could
not
consider
him
downright
harmful
however
under
little
flags
on
them
and
trying
hard
to
invent
to
the
last
detail
a
successful
campaign
bazaine
advancing
on
berlin
frossard
penetrating
bavaria
and
mac
mahon
reaching
the
baltic
to
work
this
all
out
she
needed
help
and
i
helped
her
as
much
as
i
could
but
the
one
who
helped
her
most
was
her
grandfather
himself
he
had
conquered
germany
so
many
times
during
the
first
empire
he
knew
every
move
this
will
be
the
enemy
s
next
move
here
he
would
say
and
ours
will
be
this
his
anticipations
were
always
justified
by
the
event
which
made
him
not
a
little
proud
unhappily
no
matter
how
fast
we
took
cities
and
won
battles
we
never
went
fast
enough
for
him
the
old
fellow
was
insatiable
each
new
success
doctor
we
have
taken
mayence
said
the
little
girl
coming
to
meet
me
with
a
smile
that
went
to
your
heart
and
through
the
door
i
heard
his
glad
salutation
we
re
getting
on
in
another
week
we
shall
be
in
berlin
at
that
time
the
prussians
were
only
a
week
s
march
from
paris
at
first
we
wondered
whether
we
had
not
better
carry
our
patient
into
the
country
then
we
reflected
that
as
soon
as
he
was
taken
out
of
the
house
he
would
learn
the
true
state
of
affairs
and
i
decided
that
he
was
still
too
feeble
too
stunned
by
his
stroke
to
let
him
find
out
the
truth
so
we
decided
to
stay
where
we
were
the
first
day
of
the
prussian
occupation
i
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
apartment
i
remember
with
a
heavy
heart
at
the
thought
of
all
the
closed
doors
of
paris
and
the
fighting
going
on
under
her
walls
in
the
suburbs
which
were
now
up
in
bed
jubilant
and
proud
well
he
said
the
siege
has
begun
i
looked
at
him
in
amazement
so
you
know
now
colonel
his
grandchild
turned
to
me
why
yes
doctor
that
is
the
great
news
to
day
the
siege
of
berlin
has
begun
and
while
she
spoke
she
went
on
with
her
sewing
as
calmly
as
you
please
how
could
he
suspect
what
was
happening
he
could
nt
hear
the
guns
at
the
fortifications
he
could
nt
see
the
city
in
its
fear
and
sorrow
from
his
bed
he
could
see
one
side
of
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
his
room
was
filled
with
odds
and
ends
of
the
period
of
the
first
empire
all
admirably
fitted
to
sustain
his
illusions
portraits
of
napoleon
s
marshals
battle
prints
a
picture
of
the
little
king
of
rome
in
his
baby
dress
big
stiff
consoles
decorated
with
trophies
covered
with
imperial
relics
medallions
bronzes
a
piece
of
the
all
representing
the
same
blue
eyed
lady
now
with
hair
curled
now
in
a
ball
dress
now
in
a
yellow
gown
with
leg
of
mutton
sleeves
and
all
this
consoles
king
of
rome
marshals
yellow
gowned
short
waisted
ladies
with
that
prim
stiffness
which
was
considered
graceful
in
this
atmosphere
of
victory
and
conquest
it
was
this
more
than
anything
we
could
say
to
him
that
made
him
accept
so
naively
the
siege
of
berlin
after
that
day
our
military
operations
grew
simpler
and
simpler
nothing
but
a
little
patience
was
needed
in
order
to
take
berlin
every
little
while
when
the
old
gentleman
grew
listless
we
read
him
a
letter
from
his
son
an
imaginary
letter
of
course
as
paris
was
by
now
cut
off
and
as
since
sedan
the
aide
de
camp
of
mac
mahon
had
been
sent
to
a
german
fortress
you
can
easily
imagine
the
despair
of
the
poor
child
who
heard
nothing
from
her
father
knowing
that
he
was
a
prisoner
deprived
of
even
comfort
and
perhaps
sick
while
she
of
joy
brief
indeed
such
as
a
soldier
would
write
from
the
field
a
soldier
advancing
day
by
day
through
the
enemy
s
country
sometimes
it
was
too
much
for
her
and
weeks
went
by
without
a
letter
the
old
man
began
to
worry
and
to
be
unable
to
sleep
then
presto
a
letter
from
germany
would
arrive
and
she
would
read
it
gayly
at
her
grandfather
s
bedside
holding
back
her
tears
the
old
colonel
would
listen
gravely
smile
knowingly
approve
criticize
and
explain
to
us
any
passage
which
seemed
confused
but
it
was
in
the
replies
that
he
made
to
his
son
that
he
was
magnificent
never
forget
that
you
are
french
he
wrote
be
generous
to
the
poor
germans
do
nt
let
them
suffer
more
than
is
inevitable
from
the
invasion
of
their
country
and
then
came
suggestions
without
end
charming
moralizing
on
property
rights
the
courtesy
due
to
women
a
veritable
code
of
honor
for
conquerors
all
the
peace
terms
on
this
last
point
he
was
not
unduly
exacting
indemnity
and
nothing
more
what
good
would
their
provinces
be
to
us
a
france
could
never
be
made
out
of
a
germany
he
dictated
that
in
a
firm
voice
and
one
could
not
hear
him
without
emotion
there
was
so
much
sincerity
so
beautiful
a
patriotism
in
what
he
said
meanwhile
the
siege
was
progressing
not
the
siege
of
berlin
unfortunately
we
had
reached
the
period
of
severe
cold
the
bombardment
the
epidemics
the
famine
but
thanks
to
our
efforts
to
the
infinite
tenderness
which
enfolded
him
the
serenity
of
the
old
old
man
was
never
troubled
to
the
end
i
was
able
to
get
white
bread
and
fresh
meat
for
him
for
him
alone
of
course
you
ca
nt
imagine
anything
more
touching
than
these
luncheons
so
innocent
in
their
egotism
the
old
gentleman
sitting
up
in
bed
fresh
and
smiling
his
napkin
tucked
under
his
chin
and
his
pale
little
granddaughter
at
hand
to
him
as
he
ate
all
these
forbidden
good
things
then
animated
by
his
meal
in
the
comfort
of
his
warm
room
while
the
winter
s
wind
whistled
outside
and
the
snow
flakes
whirled
around
the
windows
the
ex
cuirassier
told
us
for
the
want
peter
whatever
his
morals
to
think
that
we
ate
our
food
raw
off
the
bone
and
made
fire
by
rubbing
sticks
together
yet
he
must
have
come
pretty
close
to
believing
that
unimpeachable
as
his
manners
remained
for
whinnie
had
burned
the
roast
of
veal
to
a
charry
mass
the
twins
were
crying
of
the
dining
room
table
with
worcestershire
sauce
i
showed
peter
where
he
could
wash
up
and
where
he
could
find
a
whisk
to
remove
the
dried
mud
from
his
person
then
i
hurriedly
appeased
my
complaining
bairns
opened
a
can
of
beans
to
take
the
place
of
whinnie
s
boiled
potatoes
which
most
unmistakably
tasted
of
yellow
soap
and
supplemented
what
looked
dishearteningly
like
a
dixon
dinner
with
my
last
carefully
treasured
jar
of
raspberry
preserve
whinstane
sandy
it
is
true
remained
as
glum
and
silent
as
a
glacier
through
all
that
meal
but
my
new
man
peter
talked
easily
and
uninterruptedly
and
he
talked
amazingly
well
he
talked
about
mountain
goats
and
the
morgan
rose
jars
in
the
metropolitan
and
why
he
disliked
george
moore
and
the
difference
between
english
and
american
slang
and
why
english
women
always
wear
the
wrong
sort
of
hats
and
the
poetry
in
indian
names
if
we
only
had
the
brains
to
understand
em
and
how
the
wheat
i
d
manufactured
my
home
made
bread
out
of
and
how
the
alcohol
and
carbonic
acid
gas
of
the
fermented
yeast
affected
the
gluten
and
how
the
woman
who
could
make
bread
like
that
ought
to
have
a
specially
designed
decoration
pinned
on
her
apron
front
then
he
played
paddy
cake
paddy
cake
baker
s
man
with
dinkie
who
took
to
him
at
once
and
when
i
came
back
from
getting
the
extra
cot
ready
in
the
bunk
house
my
infant
prodigy
was
on
the
new
hired
man
s
back
circling
the
dinner
table
and
shouting
gid
dap
ossie
gid
dap
as
he
went
a
proceeding
which
left
the
seamed
old
face
of
whinstane
sandy
about
as
blithe
as
a
coffin
lid
so
i
coldly
informed
the
newcomer
that
i
d
show
him
where
he
could
put
his
things
if
he
had
any
before
we
went
out
to
look
over
the
windmill
and
peter
rather
astonished
me
by
lugging
back
from
the
motor
car
so
discreetly
left
in
the
rear
a
huge
suit
case
of
pliable
pigskin
that
looked
like
a
steamer
trunk
with
carrying
handles
attached
to
it
like
a
norfolk
jacket
a
chamois
lined
ulster
a
couple
of
plaid
woolen
rugs
and
a
lunch
kit
in
a
neatly
embossed
leather
case
quite
a
bit
of
loot
is
nt
it
he
said
a
little
red
in
the
face
from
the
effort
of
portaging
so
pretentious
a
load
that
word
loot
stuck
in
my
craw
it
was
a
painful
reminder
of
something
that
i
d
been
trying
very
hard
to
forget
did
it
come
with
the
car
i
demanded
yes
it
came
with
the
car
he
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
but
it
would
be
exhausting
do
nt
you
see
to
have
to
tunnel
through
a
hay
stack
every
time
i
wanted
a
hair
brush
i
icily
agreed
that
it
would
scenting
tacit
reproof
in
that
mildly
put
observation
of
his
but
i
did
nt
propose
to
be
trifled
with
i
calmly
led
mr
peter
ketley
out
to
where
the
overturned
windmill
tower
lay
like
a
museum
skeleton
along
its
bed
of
weeds
and
asked
him
simple
question
predicating
a
simple
answer
yet
he
did
nt
seem
able
to
reply
to
it
he
scratched
his
close
clipped
pate
and
said
he
d
have
to
look
things
over
and
study
it
out
windmills
were
tricky
things
one
kind
demanding
this
sort
of
treatment
and
another
kind
demanding
that
you
ll
have
no
trouble
of
course
in
raising
the
tower
i
asked
looking
him
square
in
the
eye
more
than
once
i
d
seen
these
windmill
towers
of
galvanized
steel
girders
put
up
on
the
prairie
and
i
had
a
very
good
idea
of
how
the
thing
was
done
they
were
assembled
lying
on
the
ground
and
then
a
heavy
plank
was
bolted
to
the
bottom
side
of
the
tower
base
this
plank
was
held
in
place
by
two
big
stakes
then
a
block
and
tackle
was
attached
to
the
upper
part
of
the
tower
with
the
running
rope
looped
over
a
tripod
of
poles
to
act
as
a
fulcrum
so
that
when
a
team
of
horses
was
attached
to
rose
in
the
air
steadied
by
a
couple
of
guy
ropes
held
out
at
right
angles
to
it
oh
no
trouble
at
all
replied
the
expert
quite
airily
but
i
noticed
that
his
eye
held
an
especially
abstracted
and
preoccupied
expression
just
how
is
it
done
i
innocently
inquired
well
that
all
depends
he
sapiently
observed
then
apparently
nettled
by
my
obviously
superior
smile
he
straightened
up
and
said
i
want
you
to
leave
this
entirely
to
me
it
s
my
problem
and
you
ve
no
right
to
be
worried
over
it
it
ll
take
study
of
course
and
it
ll
take
time
rome
was
nt
built
in
a
day
but
before
i
leave
you
madam
your
tower
will
be
up
i
hope
you
re
not
giving
yourself
a
life
sentence
i
remarked
as
i
turned
and
left
him
i
knew
that
he
was
looking
after
me
as
i
went
but
i
gave
no
outer
of
his
movements
through
the
shack
window
when
he
possessed
himself
of
a
hay
fork
and
with
more
than
one
backward
look
over
his
shoulder
circled
out
to
where
his
car
still
stood
he
tooled
it
still
closer
up
beside
the
hay
stack
which
he
mounted
and
then
calmly
and
cold
bloodedly
buried
under
a
huge
mound
of
sun
cured
prairie
grass
that
relic
of
a
past
crime
which
he
seemed
only
too
willing
to
obliterate
but
he
was
callous
i
could
see
for
once
that
telltale
car
was
out
of
sight
he
appeared
much
more
interested
in
the
was
slow
to
kindle
he
put
a
curb
now
on
even
his
naturally
deliberate
vehicle
of
wrath
looking
the
man
through
his
shallow
eyes
down
to
the
roots
of
his
mean
soul
you
re
to
take
off
our
hats
when
we
see
a
fence
hargus
said
looking
meaner
with
every
breath
you
ve
got
it
right
pardner
lambert
calmly
replied
duke
of
chimney
butte
well
pardner
i
m
the
king
of
hotfoot
valley
and
i
ve
got
travelin
papers
for
you
right
here
you
seem
to
be
a
little
sudden
about
it
lambert
said
a
lazy
drawl
to
his
words
that
inflamed
hargus
like
a
blow
not
half
as
sudden
as
you
ll
be
kid
this
country
ai
nt
no
place
for
you
young
feller
you
re
too
fresh
to
keep
in
this
hot
climate
and
the
longer
you
stay
the
hotter
it
gits
i
ll
give
you
just
two
days
to
make
your
gitaway
in
consider
the
two
days
up
said
lambert
with
such
calm
and
such
coolness
of
head
that
men
who
heard
him
felt
a
thrill
of
admiration
this
ai
nt
no
joke
hargus
as
far
as
it
concerns
me
i
m
just
as
far
from
this
country
right
now
as
i
ll
be
in
two
days
or
maybe
two
years
consider
your
limit
up
it
was
so
still
in
the
barroom
that
one
could
have
heard
a
match
burn
lambert
had
drawn
himself
up
stiff
and
straight
before
hargus
and
stood
facing
him
with
defiance
in
every
line
of
his
stern
strong
face
i
ve
give
you
your
rope
hargus
said
feeling
that
he
had
been
called
to
show
his
hand
in
an
open
manner
that
was
not
his
style
and
playing
for
a
footing
to
save
his
face
if
you
ai
nt
gone
in
two
days
you
ll
settle
with
me
that
goes
with
me
hargus
it
s
your
move
lambert
turned
contempt
in
his
courageous
bearing
and
walked
out
of
the
place
scorning
to
throw
a
glance
behind
to
see
whether
hargus
came
after
him
or
whether
he
laid
hand
to
his
weapon
in
the
xv
wolves
of
the
range
lambert
left
his
horse
at
the
saloon
hitching
rack
while
he
went
to
the
store
business
was
brisk
in
that
place
also
requiring
a
wait
of
half
an
hour
before
his
turn
came
in
a
short
time
thereafter
he
completed
his
purchases
tied
his
package
to
his
saddle
and
was
ready
to
go
home
the
sound
of
revelry
was
going
forward
again
in
the
saloon
the
mechanical
banjo
plugging
away
on
its
tiresome
tune
there
was
a
gap
here
and
there
at
the
rack
where
horses
had
been
taken
away
but
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
anchored
there
for
the
night
standing
dejectedly
with
drooping
heads
the
tinkle
of
alta
s
guitar
sounded
through
the
open
window
of
the
hotel
parlor
as
he
passed
indicating
that
taterleg
was
still
in
that
harbor
it
would
be
selfish
to
call
him
making
the
most
as
he
was
of
a
clear
field
lambert
smiled
as
he
recalled
the
three
cornered
rivalry
for
alta
s
bony
hand
there
was
a
lemon
rind
slice
of
new
the
huddling
sage
clumps
at
the
roadside
blotches
of
deepest
shadow
lambert
ruminated
on
the
trouble
that
had
been
laid
out
for
him
that
night
as
he
rode
away
from
town
going
slowly
in
no
hurry
to
put
walls
between
him
and
the
soft
pleasant
night
he
was
confronted
by
the
disadvantage
of
an
unsought
notoriety
or
reputation
or
whatever
his
local
fame
might
be
called
a
man
with
a
fighting
name
must
live
up
to
it
however
distasteful
the
strife
and
turmoil
or
move
beyond
the
circle
of
his
fame
move
he
would
not
could
not
although
it
seemed
a
foolish
thing
on
reflection
to
hang
on
there
in
the
lure
of
grace
kerr
s
dark
eyes
what
could
a
man
reasonably
expect
of
a
girl
with
such
people
as
sim
hargus
as
her
daily
associates
surely
she
had
been
schooled
in
their
warped
view
of
justice
as
her
act
that
day
proved
no
matter
for
omaha
and
its
refinements
she
must
be
a
savage
under
the
skin
for
her
a
feeling
of
romantic
sympathy
that
had
been
groping
out
to
find
her
as
a
plant
in
a
pit
strains
toward
the
light
now
in
the
sunshine
of
her
presence
would
it
flourish
and
grow
green
or
wither
in
its
mistaken
worship
and
die
vesta
had
warned
him
not
knowing
anything
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
which
brought
him
to
that
place
or
of
his
discovery
which
seemed
a
revelation
of
fate
the
conjunction
of
events
shaped
before
his
entry
upon
the
stage
indeed
she
had
warned
him
but
in
the
face
of
things
as
they
had
taken
place
what
would
it
avail
a
man
to
turn
his
back
on
the
arrangements
of
destiny
as
it
was
written
so
it
must
be
lived
it
was
not
in
his
hand
or
his
heart
to
change
it
turning
these
things
in
his
mind
flavoring
the
bitter
in
the
prospect
with
the
sweet
of
romance
he
was
drawn
out
of
his
wanderings
by
the
sudden
starting
of
his
horse
it
was
not
a
leap
out
of
laxity
into
alertness
with
a
lifting
of
the
head
a
fixing
of
the
ears
as
if
on
some
object
ahead
of
which
it
was
at
once
curious
and
afraid
lambert
was
all
tension
in
a
breath
ahead
a
little
way
the
road
branched
at
the
point
of
the
hill
leading
to
the
philbrook
house
his
road
lay
to
the
right
of
the
jutting
plowshare
of
hill
which
seemed
shaped
for
the
mere
purpose
of
splitting
the
highway
the
other
branch
led
to
kerr
s
ranch
and
beyond
the
horse
was
plainly
scenting
something
in
this
latter
branch
of
the
road
still
hidden
by
the
bushes
which
grew
as
tall
there
as
the
head
of
a
man
on
horseback
as
the
horse
trotted
on
lambert
made
out
something
lying
in
know
you
ll
see
little
girl
what
would
you
say
if
i
showed
you
a
real
bank
account
i
would
nt
waste
time
talking
i
d
marry
you
her
good
humour
was
returning
honest
gay
do
you
think
you
might
draw
down
some
kale
trust
in
any
one
who
was
paying
her
attention
with
a
different
type
of
man
trudy
would
have
been
beaten
courageously
had
the
gentleman
arrested
and
then
interfered
when
the
judge
was
directing
him
to
the
penitentiary
i
wish
you
would
nt
talk
that
way
when
we
are
married
and
you
meet
my
friends
you
ll
have
to
brush
up
on
a
lot
of
things
i
guess
i
ll
manage
to
be
understood
she
retorted
and
when
we
are
married
maybe
you
can
get
my
job
so
as
to
support
your
wife
the
orchestra
began
playing
a
new
rag
and
trudy
and
gay
immediately
left
their
chairs
to
be
the
first
couple
on
the
floor
they
were
prouder
of
their
dancing
than
of
each
other
after
several
dances
they
became
optimistic
over
the
future
and
finished
their
dinner
with
the
understanding
that
at
the
first
possible
moment
they
would
be
married
and
trudy
was
to
be
a
hard
working
little
bride
causing
her
husband
s
men
friends
to
be
nice
to
the
vondeplosshes
to
his
wife
they
decided
too
that
mary
faithful
was
clever
and
good
but
queer
that
steve
o
valley
would
discover
that
a
self
made
man
could
not
marry
an
heiress
and
make
a
go
of
it
as
well
as
a
man
of
an
aristocratic
family
could
marry
an
adorable
red
haired
young
lady
and
elevate
her
to
his
position
that
trudy
was
far
more
beautiful
than
beatrice
constantine
and
as
one
lived
only
once
in
this
world
why
not
always
strive
for
a
good
time
whereat
they
had
a
farewell
dance
and
moved
on
to
the
moving
picture
world
where
they
held
hands
and
stared
vapidly
at
the
films
repairing
to
a
cafeteria
on
a
side
street
for
a
lunch
and
then
to
the
faithful
parlour
mary
had
gone
to
church

boy
friends
in
to
discuss
a
summer
camp

his
mother
snored
mildly
on
the
dining
room
sofa
they
took
possession
of
the
front
parlour
and
the
enlarged
crayons
of
the
faithful
ancestors
bore
witness
that
for
more
than
two
hours
these
young
people
giggled

then
planned
how
to
get
everything
for
nothing
and
having
done
so
not
to
share
their
spoils
a
perfectly
lovely
time
trudy
said
glibly
as
she
kissed
gay
good
night
perfectly
lovely
he
echoed
politely
do

work
too
hard

you

do
nothing
rash
until

giggled
the

of

so
bubseley
tottered
down
the
walk
while
babseley
turned
out
the
lights
and
retired
to
her
room
with
a
bag
of
candy
and
a
paprika
brand
of
novel
at
midnight
she
tossed
it
aside
and
with
self
pity
prepared
to
go
to
sleep

have
to
go

in
the
quartet
which
was
abandoned
because
of
aunt
belle
s
dislike
of
stage
life
and
its
temptations
while
his
rolling
off
the
three
story
building
was
never
alluded
to
except
when
mark
constantine
wished
to
tease
she
was
a
short
plump
person
with
permanently
jet
black
hair
and
twinkling
eyes
prepared
to
forgo
all
else
save
elegance
she
had
brought
up
her
gorgeous
niece
with
the
idea
that
it
was
never
possible
to
have
too
much
luxury
seated
in
the
gorgeous
girl
s
dressing
room
she
now
presented
excellent
proof
that
the
world
was
growing
very
old
indeed
for
her
plump
self
was
squeezed
into
a
short
purple
affair
made
like
a
pinafore
her
high
heeled
bronze
slippers
causing
her
to
totter
like
a
mandarin
s
wife
and
strings
of
coral
beads
and
a
gold
lorgnette
rose
and
fell
with
rhythmic
motion
as
she
sighed
very
properly
over
her
niece
s
marriage
it
will
never
be
the
same
darling
she
was
saying
glancing
in
a
mirror
to
see
if
the
light
showed
the
rouge
boundaries
too
clearly
never
quite
for
you
have
been
just
as
dear
as
one
beatrice
who
was
busy
inspecting
some
newly
arrived
lingerie
did
not
glance
up
as
she
answered
do
nt
be
silly
you
know
it
s
a
relief
you
can
sit
back
and
rest
from
now
on
until
i
m
divorced
she
added
with
a
smile
how
can
you
even
say
such
a
thing
beatrice
tossed
the
filmy
creamy
silk
somethings
or
other
away
and
delivered
herself
of
her
mind
alice
twill
was
divorced
before
she
married
this
specimen
so
belief
that
this
last
conjecture
was
the
true
one
the
world
outside
was
turning
dark
the
sky
was
growing
thick
and
low
in
half
an
hour
a
storm
would
break
the
eskimos
had
foreseen
that
storm
they
knew
that
the
trail
taken
in
their
flight
after
they
had
possessed
themselves
of
the
girl
would
very
soon
be
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
bram
and
the
keen
scent
of
his
wolves
so
they
had
taken
the
chance
the
chance
to
make
celie
their
prisoner
before
bram
returned
and
why
philip
asked
himself
did
these
savage
little
barbarians
of
the
north
want
her
the
fighting
she
had
long
time
the
kogmollocks
had
been
making
trouble
in
the
last
year
they
had
killed
a
dozen
white
men
along
the
upper
coast
including
two
american
explorers
and
a
missionary
three
patrols
had
been
sent
to
coronation
gulf
and
bathurst
inlet
since
august
with
the
first
of
those
patrols
headed
by
olaf
anderson
the
swede
he
had
come
within
an
ace
of
going
himself
a
rumor
had
come
down
to
churchill
just
before
he
left
for
the
barrens
that
olaf
s
party
of
five
men
had
been
wiped
out
it
was
not
difficult
to
understand
why
the
eskimos
had
attacked
celie
armin
s
father
and
those
who
had
come
ashore
with
him
from
the
ship
it
was
merely
a
question
of
lust
for
white
men
s
blood
and
white
men
s
plunder
and
strangers
in
their
country
would
naturally
be
regarded
as
easy
victims
the
mysterious
and
inexplicable
part
of
the
affair
was
their
pursuit
of
the
girl
in
this
pursuit
the
kogmollocks
had
come
far
beyond
the
southernmost
boundary
of
their
hunting
grounds
philip
was
sufficiently
ran
very
little
of
the
red
blooded
passion
of
the
white
man
matehood
was
more
of
a
necessity
imposed
by
nature
than
a
joy
in
their
existence
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
believe
that
even
celie
armin
s
beauty
had
roused
the
desire
for
possession
among
them
his
attention
turned
to
the
gathering
of
the
storm
the
amazing
swiftness
with
which
the
gray
day
was
turning
into
the
dark
gloom
of
night
fascinated
him
and
he
almost
called
to
celie
that
she
might
look
upon
the
phenomenon
with
him
it
was
piling
in
from
the
vast
barrens
to
the
north
and
east
and
for
a
time
it
was
accompanied
by
a
stillness
that
was
oppressive
he
could
no
longer
distinguish
a
movement
in
the
tops
of
the
cedars
and
banskian
pine
beyond
the
corral
in
the
corral
itself
he
caught
now
and
then
the
shadowy
flitting
movement
of
the
wolves
he
did
not
hear
celie
when
she
came
out
of
her
room
so
intently
was
he
straining
his
eyes
to
penetrate
the
thickening
pall
of
gloom
that
he
was
unconscious
there
was
something
in
the
awesome
darkening
of
the
world
that
brought
them
closer
in
that
moment
and
without
speaking
philip
found
her
hand
and
held
it
in
his
own
they
heard
then
a
low
whispering
sound
a
sound
that
came
creeping
up
out
of
the
end
of
the
world
like
a
living
thing
a
whisper
so
vast
that
after
a
little
it
seemed
to
fill
the
universe
growing
louder
and
louder
until
it
was
no
longer
a
whisper
but
a
moaning
shrieking
wail
it
was
appalling
as
the
first
blast
of
it
swept
over
the
cabin
no
other
place
in
the
world
is
there
storm
like
the
storm
that
sweeps
over
the
great
barren
no
other
place
in
the
world
where
storm
is
filled
with
such
a
moaning
shrieking
tumult
of
voice
it
was
not
new
to
philip
he
had
heard
it
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
ten
thousand
little
children
were
crying
under
the
rolling
and
twisting
onrush
of
the
clouds
he
had
heard
it
when
it
seemed
to
him
the
darkness
was
filled
which
rose
piercing
human
shrieks
and
the
sobbing
grief
of
women
s
voices
it
had
driven
people
mad
through
the
long
dark
night
of
winter
when
for
five
months
they
caught
no
glimpse
of
the
sun
even
the
little
brown
eskimos
went
keskwao
and
destroyed
themselves
because
of
the
madness
that
was
in
that
storm
and
now
it
swept
over
the
cabin
and
in
celie
s
throat
there
rose
a
little
sob
so
swiftly
had
darkness
gathered
that
philip
could
no
longer
see
her
except
where
her
face
made
a
pale
shadow
in
the
gloom
but
he
could
feel
the
tremble
of
her
body
against
him
was
it
only
this
morning
that
he
had
first
seen
her
he
asked
himself
was
it
not
a
long
long
time
ago
and
had
she
not
in
that
time
become
flesh
and
soul
a
part
of
him
he
put
out
his
arms
warm
and
trembling
and
unresisting
in
that
thick
gloom
she
lay
within
them
his
soul
rose
in
a
wild
ecstasy
and
rode
on
the
his
breast
and
he
said
nothing
can
hurt
you
dear
nothing
nothing
it
was
a
simple
and
meaningless
thing
to
say
that
and
only
that
and
yet
he
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
holding
her
closer
and
closer
until
her
heart
was
throbbing
against
his
own
nothing
can
hurt
you
nothing
nothing
he
bent
his
head
her
face
was
turned
up
to
him
and
suddenly
he
was
thrilled
by
the
warm
sweet
touch
of
her
lips
he
kissed
her
she
did
not
strain
away
from
him
he
felt
in
that
darkness
the
wild
fire
in
her
face
nothing
can
hurt
you
nothing
nothing
he
cried
almost
sobbingly
in
his
happiness
suddenly
there
came
a
blast
of
the
storm
that
rocked
the
cabin
like
the
butt
of
a
battering
ram
and
in
that
same
moment
there
came
from
just
outside
the
window
a
shrieking
cry
such
as
philip
had
never
heard
in
all
his
life
before
and
following
the
cry
there
rose
above
the
tumult
of
the
storm
the
howling
of
bram
johnson
that
the
cry
must
have
come
from
bram
johnson
himself
that
the
wolf
man
should
be
ready
by
now
i
move
we
go
back
and
turn
in
the
mystery
of
it
all
too
added
elfreda
turning
to
walk
to
the
camp
the
guide
told
them
not
to
be
concerned
at
his
absence
if
he
did
not
get
overland
riders
sought
their
blankets
for
a
rest
which
all
needed
the
night
passed
without
one
of
the
girls
moving
so
far
as
any
of
them
could
remember
when
they
were
rudely
awakened
next
morning
shouts
and
yells
from
hippy
wingate
and
a
scream
from
emma
dean
brought
grace
elfreda
anne
and
nora
to
their
feet
hurriedly
throwing
on
sufficient
clothing
to
make
themselves
presentable

demanded
grace
appearing
on
the
scene

that
juncture

very
suddenly

than
five
minutes
ago
averred
elfreda
look
s
tent
only
the
top
of
which
was
visible
above
the
ground
grace
was
already
running
towards
the
tent
believing
she
knew
just
what
the
trouble
was
hippy
are
you
there
she
called
i

that

away
the
wreckage
so

can
see
what

grace
and
elfreda
hauled
the
tent
out
of
the
hole
in
the
alkali
crust
and
peered
in
hippy
was
sitting
at
the
bottom
about
five
feet
below
the
surface
and
the
instant
grace
thrust
her
head
into
the
opening
she
uttered
a
cry
water
she
exclaimed
i
smell
it
i
tasted
it
when
i
landed
on
my
head
in
the
wet
sand
answered
hippy
it
was
good
but
i
d
a
heap

gasped
emma
dean
and
it
is
nt
another
mirage
it
is
water
my
dear
but
how
much
of
a
supply
there
is
remains
to
be
seen
what
were
you
doing
out
so
early
i
was
going
out
to
get
some
water
food
from
that
horrible
looking
pumpkin
plant
or
whatever
it
is
ping
oh
ping
fetch
the
water
buckets
hurry
mr
lang

gone
so
we
must
do
what
is
to
be
done
before
the
water
disappears
what
happened
hippy
asked
grace
this
did
brown
eyes
i
turned
over
on
my
blanket
then
the
earth
yawned
and
swallowed
me
down
i
slid
in
head
first
here
are
the
buckets
and
the
canvas
i
think
i
will
get
down
there
and
assist

girls
drink
your
fill
then
water
the
ponies
no
you
carry
the
water
out
and
let
ping
do
the
watering
and
immediately
began
digging
in
the
sand
which
was
wet
and
sticky
with
hippy
s
aid
she
patted
the
canvas
blanket
down
as
she
had
seen
hi
lang
do
it
and
in
a
moment
the
water
began
seeping
through
grace
observed
that
it
seeped
much
more
rapidly
than
when
the
guide
had
performed
a
similar
operation
buckets
demanded
hippy
they
were
lowered
and
in
a
few
moments
half
a
dozen
of
them
were
filled
and
handed
up
to
the
outstretched
hands
waiting
to
receive
them
this
is
splendid
i
wish
mr
lang
were
here
too
bad
said
grace
might
it
not
be
a
good
idea
for
us
to
fire
signal
shots
to
recall
him
he
may
be
within
hearing
sound

a
long
distance
on

desert
suggested
miss
briggs
fine
j
elfreda
will
you
fire
the
shots
miss
briggs
said
she
would
and
in
a
few
moments
three
interval
shots
rang
out
elfreda
fired
the
reply
none
was
heard
however
and
grace
suggested
that
she
wait
half
an
hour
or
so
then
try
it
again
the
baling
went
on
but
the
ponies
and
burros
drank
the
water
faster
than
grace
and
hippy
could
get
it
out
of
the
tank
and
pass
it
up
to
those
who
were
carrying
water
to
ping
who
was
giving
it
to
the
horses

grace
holding
up
a
hand
for
silence
the
reports
of
two
rifle
shots
were
faintly
borne
to
their
ears
that
s
a
signal
i
heard
the
first
a
second
before
i
box
holding
his
reins
with
his
head
bent
on
his
chest
he
was
thinking
sadly
of
the
long
lost
days
of
his
youth
and
wishing
he
had
been
a
better
man
liza
had
no
respect
for
such
holy
emotions
and
she
brought
down
her
fist
on
the
crown
of
his
hat
and
bashed
it
over
his
eyes
na
then
old
jellybelly
she
said

she
was
tremendously
excited
laughing
and
singing
keeping
the
whole
company
in
an
uproar
in
her
jollity
she
had
changed
hats
with
tom
and
he
in
her
big
feathers
made
her
shriek
with
laughter
when
they
started
they
began
to
sing
for
e
s
a
jolly
good
feller
making
the
night
resound
blakestons
had
got
a
seat
together
liza
being
between
the
two
men
tom
was
perfectly
happy
and
only
wished
that
they
might
go
on
so
for
ever
gradually
as
they
drove
along
they
became
quieter
their
singing
ceased
and
they
talked
in
undertones
some
of
them
slept
sally
and
her
young
man
were
leaning
up
against
one
another
slumbering
quite
peacefully
the
night
was
beautiful
the
sky
still
blue
very
dark
scattered
over
with
countless
brilliant
stars
and
liza
as
she
looked
up
at
the
heavens
felt
a
certain
emotion
as
if
she
wished
to
be
taken
in
someone
s
arms
or
feel
some
strong
man
s
caress
and
there
was
in
her
heart
a
strange
sensation
as
though
it
were
growing
big
she
stopped
speaking
and
all
four
were
silent
then
slowly
she
felt
tom
s
arm
steal
round
her
waist
cautiously
as
though
it
were
afraid
of
being
there
this
time
both
she
and
tom
were
happy
but
suddenly
there
was
a
movement
advanced
along
her
leg
and
her
hand
was
grasped
and
gently
pressed
it
was
jim
blakeston
she
started
a
little
and
began
trembling
so
that
tom
noticed
it
and
whispered
you
re
cold
liza
na
i
m
not
tom
it
s
only
a
sort
of
shiver
thet
went
through
me
his
arm
gave
her
waist
a
squeeze
and
at
the
same
time
the
big
rough
hand
pressed
her
little
one
and
so
she
sat
between
them
till
they
reached
the
red
lion
in
the
westminster
bridge
road
and
tom
said
to
himself
i
believe
she
does
care
for

you

a
chap
said
harry
disgustedly
strolling
off
with
tom
to
the
pub
while
the
others
made
their
way
down
the
sleeping
street
the
house
where
sally
lived
came
first
and
she
left
them
then
walking
a
few
and
after
a
little
talk
at
the
door
liza
bade
the
couple
good
night
and
was
left
to
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
home
the
street
was
perfectly
silent
and
the
lamp
posts
far
apart
threw
a
dim
light
which
only
served
to
make
lisa
realize
her
solitude
there
was
such
a
difference
between
the
street
at
midday
with
its
swarms
of
people
and
now
when
there
was
neither
sound
nor
soul
besides
herself
that
even
she
was
struck
by
it
the
regular
line
of
houses
on
either
side
with
the
even
pavements
and
straight
cemented
road
seemed
to
her
like
some
desert
place
as
if
everyone
were
dead
or
a
fire
had
raged
and
left
it
all
desolate
suddenly
she
heard
a
footstep
she
started
and
looked
back
it
was
a
man
hurrying
behind
her
and
in
a
moment
she
had
recognized
jim
he
beckoned
to
her
and
in
a
low
voice
called
liza
she
stopped
till
he
had
come
up
to
her
she
said
i
ve
come
aht
ter
say
good
night

he
answered
but

drew
it
away
quickly
they

in
silence
till

sister
angela
arose
and
passed
from
the
room
the
doing
of
the
kindly
commonplace
thing
restored
her
to
her
usual
calm
she
was
not
gone
long
but
when
she
returned
bearing
the
tray
becky
had
departed
and
the
chair
in
which
she
had
sat
was
still
swaying
chapter
iii
i
brushed
all
obstructions
from
my
doorsill
and
stepped
into
the
road
it
was
just
after
sunset
the
following
day
when
jed
turned
from
the
big
road
five
miles
could
be
made
before
early
darkness
set
in
beside
him
sat
meredith
thornton
white
lipped
and
wide
eyed
and
her
aristocratic
bags
rattled
around
in
the
space
behind
the
smile
with
which
meredith
had
faced
her
past
three
years
lingered
still
on
the
set
mouth
the
smile
was
for
jed
there
seem
to
be
more
downs
than
ups
on
this
road
the
girl
said
in
order
to
cover
a
groan
it
will
be
awful

a

meredith
managed
to
give
a
weak
laugh
and
as
the
wagon
hit
another
hump
she
edged
toward
jed
after
a
few
moments
he
felt
her
head
against
his
shoulder
from
suffering
and
exhaustion
she
fell
into
a
brief
and
troubled
sleep
like
one
carved
from
rock
jed
held
his
position
while
a
reverent
expression
grew
upon
his
face
the
glow
showed
yellow
through
the
western
sky
the
gap
was
growing
purplish
and
dim
and
just
then
across
a
foot
bridge
over
the
river
a
hurrying
bent
form
appeared
it
swayed
perilously
jed
heard
a
muttered
curse

a
mighty
he
breathed
it
s
ole
aunt
becky
come
back
to
add
to
trubble
after
us
all
hopin
she
was
daid
or
something
becky
was
coming
toward
the
road
bending
over
the
bundle
she
bore
she
paused
looked
down
and
then
darted
ahead
right
in
the
path
of
the
horses
they
reared
and
something
snapped
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
an
accident
tai
nt
nothin
so
bad
as
an
accident
ma
am
jed
reassured
her
but
i
do
nt
take
no

ma

in

quarter
the
pause
gave
aunt
becky
time
to
reach
ridge
house
and
play
her
part
in
the
scheme
of
things
panting
and
well
nigh
exhausted
the
old
woman
staggered
on
and
was
thankful
to
see
at
her
journey
s
end
that
but
one
light
shone
in
the
quiet
house
the
light
was
in
the
living
room
where
angela
sat
alone
waiting
for
meredith
thornton
she
had
quite
forgotten
in
her
growingly
anxious
hours
all
about
poor
becky
and
her
sorrows
so
now
when
the
long
window
opening
on
the
west
porch
swayed
inward
she
started
up
with
outstretched
arms
and
confronted
becky
i
ve
brung
hit
becky
staggered
to
a
chair
uninvited
and
sat
down
quilt
upon
her
knees
angela
sat
down
also
she
was
speechless
and
frightened
she
watched
the
old
woman
unfold
the
coverings
and
she
saw
the
form
of
a
sleeping
new
born
baby
exposed
to
the
heat
and
light
of
the
fire
she
tried
to
say
something
to
get
control
of
herself
but
she
only
succeeded
in
bending
nearer
the
apparition
zalie
she
cum
las
night
like
i
told
you
she
would
she
s
daid
now
zalie
is
i
don
buried
her
at
sun
up
an
i
want
it
tole
if
and
pour
over
a
carefully
made
cream
sauce
i
might
add
that
one
stalk
would
furnish
sufficient
material
for
several
families
this
dish
should
be
popular
in
southwestern
states
where
the
plant
grows
profusely
and
to
cultivate
these
plants
for
shipping
to
eastern
markets
would
be
artichokes
or
lettuce
i
have
found
both
these
dishes
peculiarly
appetizing
but
i
should
be
sorry
if
in
introducing
yucca
as
a
food
i
became
instrumental
in
the
extermination
of
this
universal
and
wonderfully
beautiful
plant
for
this
reason
i
have
hesitated
about
including
yucca
among
these
articles
but
when
i
see
the
bloom
destroyed
ruthlessly
by
thousands
who
cut
it
to
decorate
touring
automobiles
and
fruit
and
vegetable
stands
beside
the
highways
who
carry
it
from
its
native
location
and
stick
it
in
the
parching
sun
of
the
seashore
as
a
temporary
shelter
i
feel
that
the
bloom
stems
might
as
well
be
used
for
food
as
to
be
so
ruthlessly
wasted
the
plant
is
hardy
in
the
extreme
growing
in
the
most
unfavorable
places
clinging
tenaciously
to
sheer
mountain
and
canyon
walls
after
blooming
and
seeding
the
plant
seems
to
have
thrown
every
particle
of
nourishment
it
contains
into
its
development
it
dries
out
and
dies
the
spongy
wood
is
made
into
pincushions
for
the
art
stores
but
from
the
roots
after
a
few
years
of
growth
mature
and
repeat
their
life
cycle
while
other
young
plants
develop
from
the
widely
scattered
seeds
the
spaniards
at
times
call
the
plant
quiota
this
word
seems
to
be
derived
from
quiotl
which
is
the
aztec
name
for
agave
from
which
plant
a
drink
not
unlike
beer
is
produced
and
suggests
the
possibility
that
there
might
have
been
a
time
when
the
succulent
flower
stem
of
the
yucca
furnished
drink
as
well
as
food
for
the
indians
after
carefully
re
reading
and
making
several
minor
corrections
linda
picked
up
her
pencil
and
across
the
top
of
a
sheet
of
heavy
paper
sketched
the
peaks
of
a
chain
of
mountains
across
the
base
she
drew
a
stretch
of
desert
floor
bristling
with
the
thorns
of
many
different
cacti
brilliant
with
their
gold
pink
and
red
bloom
intermingled
with
fine
grasses
and
desert
flower
faces
at
the
left
she
painstakingly
drew
a
huge
plant
of
yucca
with
a
perfect
circle
of
bayonets
from
the
center
of
which
uprose
the
gigantic
flower
misty
bloom
of
the
flaming
tongue
she
worked
quite
as
late
as
marian
thorne
had
ever
seen
a
light
burning
in
her
window
when
she
had
finished
her
drawing
she
studied
it
carefully
a
long
time
adding
a
touch
here
and
there
and
then
she
said
softly
there
daddy
i
feel
that
even
you
would
think
that
a
faithful
reproduction
tomorrow
night
i
ll
paint
it
john
gilman
saw
the
light
from
linda
s
window
when
he
brought
eileen
home
that
night
and
when
he
left
he
glanced
that
way
again
and
was
surprised
to
see
the
room
still
lighted
and
the
young
figure
bending
over
a
worktable
he
stood
very
still
for
a
few
minutes
wondering
what
could
keep
linda
awake
so
far
into
the
night
and
while
his
thoughts
were
upon
her
he
wondered
too
why
she
did
not
care
to
have
beautiful
clothes
such
as
eileen
wore
and
then
he
went
further
and
wondered
why
when
she
could
be
as
entertaining
as
she
had
been
the
night
she
joined
oftener
and
then
because
the
mind
is
a
queer
thing
and
he
had
wondered
about
a
given
state
of
affairs
he
went
a
step
further
and
wondered
whether
the
explanation
lay
in
linda
s
inclinations
or
in
eileen
s
management
and
then
his
thought
fastened
tenaciously
upon
the
subject
of
eileen
s
management
he
was
a
patient
man
he
had
allowed
his
reason
and
better
judgment
to
be
swayed
by
eileen
s
exquisite
beauty
and
her
blandishments
he
did
not
regret
having
discovered
before
it
was
too
late
that
marian
thorne
was
not
the
girl
he
had
thought
her
he
wanted
a
wife
cut
after
the
clinging
vine
pattern
he
wanted
to
be
the
dominating
figure
in
his
home
it
had
not
taken
eileen
long
to
teach
him
that
marian
was
self
assertive
and
would
do
a
large
share
of
dominating
herself
he
had
thought
that
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
very
happy
with
eileen
yet
that
day
he
repeatedly
had
felt
piqued
and
annoyed
with
her
she
had
openly
cajoled
and
flirted
with
henry
anderson
past
a
sweetheart
go
with
another
man
with
peter
morrison
she
had
been
unspeakably
charming
in
a
manner
with
which
john
was
very
familiar
he
turned
up
his
coat
collar
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
swore
softly
looking
straight
ahead
of
him
he
should
have
seen
a
stretch
of
level
sidewalk
bordered
on
one
hand
by
lacy
tropical
foliage
on
the
other
by
sheets
of
level
green
lawn
broken
everywhere
by
the
uprising
boles
of
great
trees
clumps
of
rare
vines
and
rows
of
darkened
homes
attractive
in
architectural
design
vine
covered
hushed
for
the
night
what
he
really
saw
was
a
small
plateau
sun
illumined
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
across
the
valley
where
the
lilac
wall
was
the
bluest
where
the
sun
shone
slightly
more
golden
than
anywhere
else
in
the
valley
where
huge
live
oaks
outstretched
rugged
arms
where
the
air
had
a
tang
of
salt
a
tinge
of
sage
an
odor
of
orange
shot
through
with
snowy
coolness
thrilled
big
spring
breaking
from
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
had
left
the
road
and
followed
a
narrow
screened
path
by
which
they
came
unexpectedly
into
this
opening
they
had
stood
upon
it
in
wordless
enchantment
looking
down
the
slope
beneath
it
across
the
peace
of
the
valley
to
the
blue
ranges
beyond
just
where
are
we
peter
morrison
had
asked
at
last
john
gilman
had
been
looking
at
a
view
which
included
eileen
she
lifted
her
face
flushed
and
exquisite
to
peter
morrison
and
answered
in
a
breathless
undertone
yet
john
this
from
view
his
excitement
was
intense
extraordinary
and
from
the
deep
hidden
recesses
of
his
mind
there
began
to
emerge
spectres
of
early
childhood
old
beliefs
banished
superstitions
the
coachman
proposed
another
route
he
shook
his
head
and
said
that
he
would
wait
he
leaned
forward
to
get
a
better
look
at
the
card
reader
s
house
then
he
made
a
gesture
of
self
ridicule
it
had
entered
his
mind
to
consult
the
fortune
teller
who
seemed
to
be
hovering
over
him
far
far
above
with
vast
ash
colored
wings
she
disappeared
reappeared
and
then
her
image
was
lost
then
in
a
few
moments
the
ash
colored
wings
stirred
again
nearer
flying
about
him
in
narrowing
circles
in
the
street
men
were
shouting
dragging
away
the
coach
there
now
push
that
s
it
now
in
a
short
while
the
obstruction
was
removed
other
things
but
the
voice
of
rita
s
husband
whispered
into
his
ears
the
words
of
the
letter
come
immediately
and
he
could
behold
the
anguish
of
the
drama
he
trembled
the
house
seemed
to
look
right
at
him
his
feet
instinctively
moved
as
if
to
leave
the
carriage
and
go
in
camillo
found
himself
before
a
long
opaque
veil
he
thought
rapidly
of
the
inexplicability
of
so
many
things
the
voice
of
his
mother
was
repeating
to
him
a
host
of
extraordinary
happenings
and
the
very
sentence
of
the
prince
of
denmark
kept
echoing
within
him
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
than
are
dreamt
of
in
our
philosophy
what
could
he
lose
by
it
if
he
jumped
out
to
the
pavement
just
before
the
fortune
teller
s
door
he
told
the
driver
to
wait
for
him
and
hastened
into
the
entry
ascending
the
stairs
there
was
little
light
the
stairs
were
worn
away
from
the
many
feet
that
had
but
he
saw
and
felt
nothing
he
stumbled
up
the
stairs
and
knocked
nobody
appearing
he
was
about
to
go
down
but
it
was
too
late
now
curiosity
was
whipping
his
blood
and
his
heart
beat
with
violent
throbs
he
turned
back
to
the
door
and
knocked
once
twice
three
times
he
beheld
a
woman
it
was
the
card
reader
camillo
said
that
he
had
come
to
consult
her
and
she
bade
him
enter
thence
they
climbed
to
the
attic
by
a
staircase
even
worse
than
the
first
and
buried
in
deeper
gloom
at
the
top
there
was
a
garret
ill
lighted
by
a
small
window
old
furniture
somber
walls
and
an
air
of
poverty
augmented
rather
than
destroyed
the
prestige
of
the
occupant
the
fortune
teller
told
him
to
be
seated
before
the
table
and
she
sat
down
on
the
opposite
side
with
her
back
to
the
window
so
that
whatever
little
light
came
from
without
fell
full
upon
camillo
s
face
she
opened
a
drawer
and
while
she
rapidly
shuffled
them
she
peered
at
him
closely
not
so
much
with
a
direct
gaze
as
from
under
her
eyes
she
was
a
woman
of
forty
italian
thin
and
swarthy
with
large
sharp
cunning
eyes
she
placed
three
cards
upon
the
table
and
said
let
us
first
see
what
has
brought
you
here
the
gentleman
has
just
received
a
severe
shock
and
is
in
great
fear
camillo
astonished
nodded
affirmatively
and
he
wishes
to
know
she
continued
whether
anything
will
happen
to
him
or
not
to
me
and
to
her
he
explained
excitedly
the
fortune
teller
did
not
smile
she
simply
told
him
to
wait
she
took
the
cards
hastily
once
more
and
shuffled
them
with
her
long
tapering
fingers
whose
nails
were
so
long
and
unclean
from
neglect
she
shuffled
them
well
once
twice
thrice
then
she
began
to
lay
them
out
camillo
s
eyes
were
riveted
upon
her
in
anxious
curiosity
forward
to
drink
in
her
words
one
by
one
then
she
told
him
to
fear
nothing
nothing
would
happen
to
him
or
to
the
other
he
the
third
was
aware
of
nought
nevertheless
great
caution
was
indispensable
envy
and
rivalry
were
at
work
she
spoke
to
him
of
the
love
that
bound
them
of
rita
s
beauty
camillo
was
bewildered
the
fortune
teller
stopped
talking
gathered
the
cards
and
locked
them
in
the
drawer
the
lady
has
restored
peace
to
my
spirit
he
said
offering
her
his
hand
across
the
table
and
pressing
that
of
the
card
reader
she
arose
laughing
go
she
said
go
ragazzo
innamorato
italian
for
love
sick
boy
young
lover
etc
and
arising
she
touched
his
head
with
her
index
finger
camillo
shuddered
as
if
it
were
the
hand
of
one
of
the
original
sybils
and
he
too
arose
the
fortune
teller
went
to
the
bureau
a
cluster
of
them
and
commenced
to
eat
them
showing
two
rows
of
teeth
that
were
as
white
as
her
nails
were
black
even
in
this
common
action
the
woman
possessed
an
air
all
her
own
camillo
anxious
to
leave
was
at
a
loss
how
much
to
pay
he
did
not
know
her
fee
raisins
cost
money
he
said
at
length
taking
out
his
pocket
book
how
much
do
you
want
to
send
for
ask
your
heart
she
replied
camillo
took
out
a
note
for
ten
milreis
and
gave
it
to
her
the
eyes
of
the
card
reader
sparkled
her
usual
fee
was
two
milreis
in
united
states
money
ten
brazilian
milreis
are
equivalent
to
about
i
can
see
easily
that
the
gentleman
loves
his
lady
very
much
and
well
he
may
for
she
loves
the
gentleman
very
deeply
too
go
go
in
peace
with
your
mind
at
ease
and
take
care
as
you
descend
the
staircase
the
fortune
teller
had
already
placed
the
note
in
her
pocket
and
accompanied
him
down
the
stairs
chatting
rather
gaily
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
flight
camillo
bid
her
good
bye
and
ran
down
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
street
while
the
card
reader
rejoicing
in
her
large
fee
turned
back
to
the
garret
humming
a
barcarolle
camillo
found
the
tilbury
most
disagreeable
laugh
i
was
nt
thinking
of
farmyard
fights
he
my
cousin
solomon
owl
grabbed
you
you
d
find
that
a
fight
in
the
woods
is
a
very
different
matter
from
a
mere
barnyard
squabble
turkey
proudfoot
was
furious
if
you
ll
come
over
here
on
this
limb
i
ll
peck
you
he
cried
huh
we
do
nt
fight
that
way
in
the
woods
simon
screecher
retorted
we
do
nt
peck
we
tear
r
r
r
he
rolled
out
the
last
word
in
a
long
drawn
quaver
which
gave
it
a
horrid
sound
especially
in
the
woods
after
dark
and
turkey
proudfoot
felt
chills
a
running
up
and
down
his
back
a
ahem
you
you
need
nt
bother
to
come
over
here
he
stammered
i
i
should
nt
like
to
peck
you
you
er
you
seem
to
be
a
very
pleasant
sort
of
person
well
i
m
not
simon
screecher
informed
him
and
you
ought
to
see
my
cousin
solomon
owl
he
s
a
terrible
fellow
turkey
proudfoot
s
wishbone
seemed
to
be
he
had
to
swallow
several
times
before
he
could
answer
i
d
like
to
see
your
cousin
he
replied
but
not
to
night
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
a
loud
call
came
booming
through
the
woods
whooo
whoo
whoo
whoo
whoo
to
whoo
ah
who
s
that
gasped
turkey
proudfoot
that
s
my
cousin
solomon
owl
simon
screecher
explained
and
he
s
not
far
away
my
goodness
turkey
proudfoot
exclaimed
if
he
s
as
big
as
his
voice
he
must
be
enormous
he
s
twice
my
size
said
simon
screecher
not
nearly
as
big
as
you
are
of
course
but
you
ought
to
see
his
beak
i
do
believe
he
could
tear
you
into
i
do
nt
want
to
see
him
to
night
turkey
proudfoot
interrupted
i
hope
he
wo
nt
come
this
way
go
and
find
him
and
tell
him
to
meet
me
here
to
morrow
night
said
simon
screecher
to
turkey
proudfoot
i

message
i
ll
tell
him
that
you
want
him
to
meet
you
here
in
this
clearing
in
the
woods
to
morrow
night
so
off
simon
screecher
flew
he
had
not
been
gone
long
when
a
noisy
haw
haw
hoo
hoo
rolled
and
echoed
through
the
woods
he
s
laughing
turkey
proudfoot
exclaimed
solomon
owl
is
laughing
i
wonder
what
the
joke
is
he
was
so
curious
to
know
that
he
actually
began
to
wish
that
simon
screecher
would
hurry
back
and
after
a
little
while
he
did
what
was
the
joke
turkey
proudfoot
demanded
i
heard
you
cousin
laughing
solomon
owl
says
that
he
does
nt
care
to
meet
you
at
all
simon
screecher
explained

and
that

tough
old
bird
i
m
not

shrieked
i
m
very
tender
and
i
m
not
does
nt
care
to
bother
with
any
but
the
very
youngest
turkeys
well
turkey
proudfoot
retorted
no

he
says
the
joke
s
on
him
i
was
nt
coming
back
here
to
morrow
night
i
do
nt
like
sleeping
in
the
woods
and
having
my
rest
disturbed
by
hoots
and
whistles
i
suppose
you
do
nt
simon
screecher
admitted
and
i
should
nt
care
to
try
to
sleep
at
the
farmyard
in
the
daytime
and
he
waked
by
gobbles
i
wish
you
would
come
down
to
the
farmyard
turkey
proudfoot
told
him
you
d
drive
old
dog
spot
half
crazy
with
your
whistling
simon
screecher
looked
thoughtful
no
he
said
farmer
green
might
drive
me
half
crazy
with
his
old
shotgun
he
yawned
as
he
spoke
i
do
nt
see
what
s
making
me
so
sleepy
he
remarked
i
must
be
going
home
do
nt
hurry
enjoy
your
company
though
i
ca
nt
exactly
say
why
and
i
d
like
to
gabble
with
you
for
an
hour
or
two
i
do
nt
see
what
makes
me
so
wakeful
just
then
a
familiar
sound
greeted
turkey
proudfoot
s
ears
it
was
a
crow
it
was
the
rooster
s
crow
way
down
at
the
farmyard
why
it
s
almost
dawn
turkey
proudfoot
exclaimed
i
did
nt
know
the
night
was
so
nearly
gone
it
s
no
wonder
i
could
nt
sleep
the
dawn
of
another
day
always
makes
one
wide
awake
it
always
makes
one
sleepy
you
mean
simon
screecher
corrected
him
now
turkey
proudfoot
always
grew
angry
when
anybody
corrected
him
in
any
way
and
he
flew
into
a
rage
go
away
go
home
he
spluttered
i
do
nt
enjoy
your
company
simon
screecher
started
homewards
at
once
farmyard
manners
he
muttered
i
declare
i
wish
cousin
solomon
and
those
four
spiders
and
those
five
grasshoppers
to
night
when
he
s
well
fed
he
s
always
good
natured
if
he
had
been
hungry
he
d
have
been
in
a
terrible
temper
and
he
d
have
fought
this
turkey
bird
until
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
but
his
tail
feathers
turkey
proudfoot
never
knew
what
a
narrow
escape
he
had
as
soon
as
it
began
to
grow
light
he
dropped
down
out
of
the
oak
tree
and
hurried
home
for
he
did
nt
want
to
miss
the
breakfast
that
farmer
green
always
gave
him
along
in
the
fall
breakfasts
always
seemed
to
be
bigger
xxii
cranberry
sauce
ho
hum
old
mr
crow
yawned
he
had
stopped
to
talk
with
turkey
proudfoot
in
the
cornfield
it
was
fall
and
the
shocks
of
corn
stood
on
every
hand
like
great
fat
scarecrows
with
fat
yellow
pumpkins
lying
at
their
feet
as
if
the
scarecrows
heads
had
fallen
off
mr
crow
always
yawned
a
good
deal
when
he
chatted
with
turkey
proudfoot
and
been
about
covering
up
his
yawns
somehow
mr
crow
found
turkey
proudfoot
dull
company
turkey
proudfoot
had
never
been
off
the
farm
on
the
other
hand
old
mr
crow
was
a
great
traveller
in
his
younger
days
he
used
to
spend
every
winter
in
the
south
and
though
he
felt
that
if
he
ordered
it
he
would
have
to
force
it
through
or
the
prestige
he
had
between
the
terror
of
a
white
man
s
gun
and
the
terror
of
a
ha
nt
the
latter
was
the
more
powerful
motioning
stuart
to
enter
and
showing
the
narrow
ledge
around
the
pit
with
the
spotlight
he
followed
then
he
turned
to
the
guards
clustered
outside
close
the
door
he
ordered
curtly
this
command
was
obeyed
with
alacrity
the
negro
guards
were
only
too
anxious
to
see
that
hole
in
the
wall
shut
suppose
the
ghost
of
christophe
should
come
gliding
out
among
them
so
far
the
cuban
was
safe
he
had
reached
the
citadel
and
entered
it
he
had
no
fear
that
the
warders
would
open
it
again
to
spy
on
him
their
terror
was
too
real
raising
the
spotlight
so
that
it
flashed
full
upon
stuart
s
face
the
cuban
spoke
understand
me
now
he
said
curtly
and
with
a
hard
ring
in
his
voice
how
much
of
your
story
may
be
true
and
how
much
false
i
have
say
about
hating
leborge
is
true
i
will
put
you
in
a
place
where
you
will
be
able
to
see
him
you
have
a
pistol
i
know
if
you
see
leborge
raise
pistol
or
knife
against
me
shoot
and
shoot
quickly
i
will
make
you
rich
stuart
thought
to
himself
that
if
the
conspirators
were
to
come
to
quarreling
that
was
the
very
time
he
would
keep
still
he
certainly
had
no
desire
for
bloodshed
nor
any
intention
to
fire
at
anybody
if
he
could
help
it
but
he
only
answered
i
understand
manuel
s
intention
was
no
less
concealed
he
planned
either
to
reveal
the
boy
to
his
fellow
conspirators
or
else
to
reveal
him
to
the
negro
warders
as
a
white
intruder
either
way
he
figured
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
boy
by
the
light
of
his
lamp
consulting
a
small
manuscript
chart
of
the
ruin
manuel
passed
through
many
tortuous
passages
and
dark
chambers
until
he
came
to
crumbling
stones
he
set
his
eye
to
a
crevice
nodded
as
though
satisfied
wrenched
away
several
more
stones
laying
these
down
silently
and
beckoned
stuart
to
come
beside
him
the
boy
looked
down
on
a
circular
hall
the
outer
arc
of
which
was
pierced
with
ruined
windows
opening
to
the
sky
leborge
will
sit
there
whispered
manuel
pointing
kill
him
and
you
will
be
rich
stuart
nodded
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
walking
as
silently
as
he
could
manuel
left
the
place
pondering
in
his
own
mind
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
boy
should
he
reveal
the
secret
and
have
his
fellow
conspirators
kill
him
should
he
turn
him
over
to
the
machetes
of
the
negroes
or
should
he
kill
the
boy
himself
one
thing
he
had
determined
that
stuart
should
not
reach
the
plains
below
alive
and
stuart
in
that
hole
of
the
ruined
wall
crouched
and
watched
of
what
was
to
happen
in
that
room
below
had
no
knowledge
yet
over
his
eager
desire
to
find
out
this
conspiracy
against
the
united
states
above
his
anxiety
with
regard
to
the
fate
of
his
father
one
question
loomed
in
ever
larger
and
blacker
proportions
he
had
got
into
the
citadel
how
was
he
to
get
out
chapter
iv
the
ghost
of
christophe
manuel
was
no
coward
somewhere
back
in
his
spanish
ancestry
had
been
a
single
drop
of
an
irish
strain
adding
a
certain
combativeness
to
the
gallantry
of
his
race
that
drop
too
mixed
badly
with
spanish
treachery
and
made
him
doubly
dangerous
certainly
the
cuban
was
no
coward
but
as
he
came
out
from
the
murk
of
those
chambers
with
their
rotting
floors
many
of
them
undermined
by
oubliettes
and
dungeons
he
felt
a
chill
of
fear
even
the
occasional
bursts
of
sunshine
through
the
cloud
fog
which
perpetually
sweeps
over
la
ferriere
did
not
hearten
him
he
passed
into
the
open
space
back
of
the
outer
walls
and
set
himself
to
climb
the
long
flight
he
thought
his
fellow
conspirators
might
be
but
on
the
summit
he
found
himself
alone
the
battlements
cowed
his
spirits
with
walls
fifteen
feet
thick
wide
enough
to
allow
a
carriage
to
be
driven
upon
them
they
looked
over
a
sheer
drop
of
two
thousand
feet
sinister
and
forbidding
even
the
sunlight
could
not
lessen
their
grimness
as
if
in
memory
of
the
hundreds
of
victims
who
had
been
bidden
jump
off
those
ramparts
merely
for
christophe
s
amusement
or
who
had
been
hurled
screaming
as
penalty
for
his
displeasure
a
ruddy
moss
feeding
upon
decay
has
spread
over
the
stones
and
this
moss
ever
kept
damp
by
the
cloud
banks
which
wreathe
the
citadel
continually
is
moistly
red
like
newly
shed
blood
in
cracks
and
corners
fungi
of
poisonous
hues
adds
another
touch
of
wickedness
manuel
shivered
with
repulsion
probably
not
in
all
the
world
certainly
not
in
the
western
hemisphere
is
there
a
ruin
of
such
historic
terror
as
the
citadel
of
the
this
ruin
now
is
nominally
in
territory
under
the
jurisdiction
of
an
american
provost
marshal
it
is
therefore
less
difficult
of
access
than
formerly
but
it
is
still
considered
unsafe
for
travelers
a
gleam
of
sun
revealed
the
extraordinary
impregnability
of
the
place
the
double
walled
entrance
from
the
hillside
pierced
by
but
a
single
gate
could
only
be
battered
down
by
heavy
artillery
and
no
guns
powerful
enough
for
such
a
feat
could
be
brought
up
the
hill
the
inner
citadel
access
to
which
was
only
by
a
long
flight
of
steps
is
unapproachable
from
any
other
point
and
a
handful
of
defenders
could
keep
an
army
at
bay
the
cliff
side
is
as
sheer
as
gibraltar
affording
not
even
a
foothold
for
the
most
venturesome
climber
the
walls
are
built
upon
its
very
verge
and
are
as
solid
as
the
rock
itself
its
gray
mass
conveys
a
sense
of
enormous
power
it
towers
upon
the
last
and
highest
it
complete
it
is
i
have
it
with
me
at
the
hotel
send
it
down
to
me
he
said
quickly
i
ll
read
it
and
give
you
a
verdict
at
once
in
an
illogical
glow
of
hope
i
hastened
to
fetch
the
manuscript
and
in
less
than
two
hours
it
was
in
his
hands
i
speak
of
my
hope
as
illogical
for
if
the
literary
monthly
of
my
own
publishers
could
not
find
a
place
for
it
how
could
i
reasonably
expect
a
hustling
bustling
popular
weekly
like
collier
s
to
use
it
nevertheless
something
in
sullivan
s
voice
and
manner
restored
my
confidence
and
when
i
called
on
the
editor
of
the
century
i
was
able
to
assume
the
tone
of
successful
authorship
the
closer
i
got
to
my
market
the
more
assured
i
my
thirty
years
of
effort
were
remembered
in
my
favor
on
tuesday
sullivan
who
had
been
called
to
the
west
wired
me
from
chicago
that
a
son
of
the
middle
border
would
make
an
admirable
serial
and
that
his
assistants
would
take
the
matter
up
with
me
i
predict
a
great
success
for
it
that
night
i
sent
a
message
to
my
wife
in
which
i
exultantly
said
rejoice
i
ve
sold
the
middle
border
to
collier
s
weekly
our
troubles
are
over
for
a
year
at
least
two
days
later
collier
s
took
a
short
story
at
four
hundred
dollars
and
the
century
gave
me
three
hundred
for
an
article
on
james
a
herne
and
when
i
boarded
the
train
for
chicago
the
following
week
i
was
not
only
four
thousand
dollars
better
off
than
when
i
came
i
had
regained
my
faith
in
the
future
my
task
was
clearly
outlined
for
the
seventh
time
i
set
to
work
revising
a
son
of
the
middle
border
preparing
it
for
serial
publication
had
been
writing
upon
this
story
for
years
stared
at
me
in
silent
amazement
when
i
told
him
of
its
sale
that
the
editor
of
a
great
periodical
should
be
interested
in
a
record
of
the
migrations
and
failures
of
the
mcclintocks
and
garlands
was
incredible
nevertheless
he
was
eager
to
see
it
in
print
and
when
in
march
the
first
installment
appeared
he
read
it
with
absorbed
attention
and
mixed
emotions
are
nt
you
a
little
hard
on
me
he
asked
with
a
light
in
his
eyes
which
was
half
humorous
half
resentful
i
do
nt
think
so
father
i
replied
you
must
admit
you
were
a
stern
disciplinarian
in
those
days
well
maybe
i
was
but
i
did
nt
realize
it
my
first
understanding
of
the
depths
this
serial
sounded
came
to
me
in
the
letters
which
were
written
to
the
editor
by
those
who
could
not
find
words
in
which
to
express
their
longing
for
the
bright
world
gone
the
world
when
they
were
young
and
glad
you
have
written
meant
that
the
facts
of
my
family
history
and
my
own
emotional
experiences
were
so
nearly
theirs
that
my
lines
awoke
an
almost
intolerable
regret
in
their
hearts
an
ache
which
is
in
my
own
heart
to
day
the
world
old
hunger
of
the
gray
haired
man
dwelling
upon
the
hope
and
illusions
of
youth
these
responses
which
indicated
a
wider
and
more
lasting
effect
than
i
had
hoped
to
produce
led
me
to
plan
for
the
publication
of
the
book
close
on
the
heels
of
the
concluding
installment
of
the
serial
but
in
this
i
was
disappointed
the
mexican
war
suddenly
thrust
new
and
tremendously
exciting
news
articles
into
the
magazine
separating
and
delaying
the
printing
of
my
story
had
it
not
been
for
the
loyalty
of
mark
sullivan
it
would
have
been
completely
side
tracked
but
he
would
not
have
it
so
on
the
contrary
he
began
to
talk
with
me
about
printing
six
more
installments
and
this
necessarily
put
off
the
question
of
finding
a
publisher
for
the
book
nevertheless
i
returned
to
my
desk
in
the
expectation
that
the
mexican
excitement
was
only
complete
the
publication
of
the
manuscript
within
the
year
my
harvest
was
not
destroyed
it
was
only
delayed
chapter
twenty
six
a
spray
of
wild
roses
although
for
several
years
my
wife
and
children
had
spent
four
months
of
each
year
in
west
salem
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
my
father
was
free
to
come
down
to
visit
us
at
any
time
i
suffered
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
almost
of
guilt
whenever
i
thought
of
him
camping
alone
for
the
larger
part
of
the
year
in
that
big
silent
house
his
love
for
the
children
and
for
zulime
made
every
day
of
his
lonely
life
a
reproach
to
me
and
yet
there
seemed
no
way
in
which
i
could
justly
grant
him
more
of
our
time
the
welfare
of
my
wife
and
the
education
of
the
children
must
be
considered
he
was
nearing
his
eighty
fourth
birthday
and
a
realization
that
every
week
in
which
he
did
not
see
his
granddaughters
was
an
irreparable
loss
gave
me
uneasiness
it
was
a
comfort
to
think
of
him
sitting
which
he
loved
and
found
a
solace
and
yet
he
was
a
lonely
old
man
that
could
not
be
denied
he
made
no
complaint
in
his
short
infrequent
letters
although
as
spring
came
on
he
once
or
twice
asked
why
do
nt
you
come
up
the
best
place
for
the
children
is
on
the
lawn
under
the
maples
in
one
note
to
me
he
said
my
old
legs
are
giving
out
i
do
nt
enjoy
walking
any
more
i
do
nt
stand
the
work
of
the
garden
as
well
as
i
did
last
year
you
d
better
come
up
and
help
me
put
in
the
seed
this
confession
produced
in
me
a
keen
pang
he
who
had
marched
so
tirelessly
under
the
lead
of
grant
and
thomas
he
who
had
fearlessly
cruised
the
pine
forests
of
wisconsin
and
joyously
explored
the
prairies
of
iowa
and
minnesota
was
now
uncertain
of
his
footing
alarmed
more
than
i
names
of
all
the
geysers
and
woodchucks
and
that
man
was
nt
right
polite
to
me
said
maw
in
commenting
upon
some
of
this
he
told
me
he
was
busy
i
d
like
to
know
what
he
s
got
to
do
just
setting
round
myself
i
sometimes
think
the
punishment
obliged
for
instance
to
know
everything
in
the
world
that
everyone
else
in
the
world
does
not
know
he
has
pictures
and
exact
measurements
of
all
the
game
animals
in
the
park
all
the
flowers
knows
all
the
colors
of
the
grand
canyon
and
the
location
of
every
sprinkling
hose
in
fifty
square
miles
i
have
never
been
able
to
ask
him
any
questions
that
he
can
not
answer
except
perhaps
my
favorite
question
why
do
they
have
this
curio
junk
in
all
the
park
stores
moccasins
leather
indian
heads
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
sobbed
when
i
asked
him
that
but
i
thought
i
could
hear
some
muttered
word
about
there
being
a
popular
demand
as
for
me
i
hold
with
maw
that
if
a
person
is
being
bitten
on
the
elbow
better
a
bottle
of
marmalade
a
loaf
of
bread
or
a
bottle
of
mosquito
dope
than
a
pair
of
beef
hide
moccasins
with
puckered
toes
in
my
belief
a
few
paintings
by
mr
thomas
moran
at
or
sets
of
the
works
of
some
of
our
more
popular
authors
with
flexible
backs
would
be
far
more
appropriate
in
the
curio
stores
maw
is
of
the
opinion
that
most
of
the
merchants
storekeepers
and
venders
of
commodities
west
of
the
mississippi
river
are
robbers
not
that
i
mean
real
robbers
like
used
to
hold
up
the
stagecoaches
here
in
the
park
she
explained
they
do
nt
do
that
no
more
since
the
cars
has
come
i
suppose
because
they
go
so
fast
that
it
ai
nt
convenient
for
robbers
no
more
but
in
the
old
times
they
tell
me
when
they
run
stagecoaches
in
here
and
did
nt
have
no
railroad
in
on
the
west
side
there
used
to
be
a
regular
business
of
holding
up
the
stagecoaches
right
over
where
old
man
dwelley
used
to
have
his
eating
house
for
lunch
there
s
a
clubhouse
there
now
instead
of
his
old
eating
house
they
say
i
heard
that
when
they
wanted
to
buy
old
man
dwelley
out
for
he
thought
a
while
and
then
did
some
counting
and
then
allowed
that
about
twelve
thousand
dollars
would
be
about
right
the
man
that
was
buying
the
place
he
set
down
and
writ
a
check
right
then
for
twelve
thousand
dollars
but
old
man
dwelley
did
nt
take
it
i
du
n
no
what
that
thing
is
says
he
when
i
say
twelve
thousand
dollars
i
mean
twelve
thousand
dollars
in
real
money
when
bozeman
was
riled
they
told
him
he
had
for
to
wait
a
few
days
and
they
went
over
to
livingston
and
got
twelve
thousand
dollars
in
five
dollar
bills
and
brung
it
to
dwelley
and
told
him
to
count
it
he
counted
a
little
of
it
and
then
said
it
was
all
right
he
d
take
their
word
for
it
that
there
was
twelve
thousand
dollars
there
so
then
he
put
it
in
a
sack
where
he
had
some
beaver
hides
they
told
me
he
sent
it
all
by
express
to
a
fur
buyer
in
salt
lake
in
a
bank
he
had
one
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
saved
out
so
they
told
me
and
he
put
that
in
the
bank
over
to
bozeman
it
riled
them
people
at
bozeman
a
good
deal
to
think
that
anybody
not
from
bozeman
should
have
one
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
inaccessible
in
their
town
so
one
day
when
old
man
dwelley
was
there
they
fined
him
one
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
for
killing
a
elk
out
of
season
or
something
that
made
him
mad
still
and
all
he
had
his
twelve
thousand
dollars
left
not
mentioning
what
he
got
for
his
beaver
hides
one
thing
with
another
continued
maw
after
a
period
of
rumination
you
ca
nt
say
but
what
this
park
is
a
fine
place
of
course
there
s
always
a
wonder
in
my
mind
where
they
get
all
the
hot
water
for
the
geysers
it
looks
to
me
like
a
industrial
waste
if
the
geysers
could
be
used
for
laundries
that
would
be
something
like
then
again
throw
in
some
bluing
now
and
then
or
some
red
or
green
they
d
look
prettier
that
d
give
more
variety
like
yet
they
say
these
geysers
has
been
running
for
years
and
no
let
up
ai
nt
it
funny
the
things
you
see
away
from
home
illustration
if
the
geysers
could
be
used
for
laundries
that
would
be
something
like
maw
p
i
like
to
ride
along
these
roads
up
in
the
mountains
and
look
down
at
the
rivers
you
get
way
up
above
a
river
and
it
looks
like
a
long
washboard
down
below
here
in
the
mountains
and
i
ll
have
to
say
the
roads
is
crooked
i
say
to
paw
we
re
all
church
members
except
cynthy
which
went
to
college
and
if
we
go
we
go
and
even
if
we
do
why
we
ve
all
had
a
vacation
and
i
ll
tell
it
to
the
world
that
a
vacation
trip
once
in
a
lifetime
is
what
the
preacher
says
about
idleness
i
m
strong
for
vacations
from
this
time
on
fact
is
i
believe
paw
and
me
has
got
to
have
them
though
this
is
our
first
and
to
think
we
was
afraid
to
buy
ice
cream
once
except
on
the
fourth
of
july
now
paw
goes
right
up
to
one
of
them
stands
and
buys
five
dollars
of
gasoline
like
it
was
nothing
times
has
changed
like
i
said
lookit
at
our
car
now
i
can
remember
back
not
so
far
neither
when
if
i
got
a
ride
in
a
side
bar
buggy
i
thought
i
was
a
mighty
lucky
girl
and
here
when
he
elbowed
his
way
through
the
press
of
fishermen
who
thronged
the
buffalo
bar
he
saw
the
russian
surrounded
by
a
jeering
crowd
got
a
job
yet
boris
some
one
called
he
s
workin
for
the
lang
girl
now
put
in
another
boris
snarled
and
flinging
his
tormentors
away
from
him
made
his
way
to
the
bar
jabbering
excitedly
in
russian
to
pete
ankovitch
blagg
moved
nearer
what
s
he
sayin
pete
he
to
hell
he
interpreted
he
say
he
show
mascola
he
ai
nt
fraid
of
no
woman
blagg
strove
to
focus
his
mind
on
the
russian
s
words
boris
was
sore
as
a
boiled
oil
crazy
as
a
coot
and
he
had
it
in
for
the
lang
girl
for
causing
him
to
get
the
can
the
russian
s
reference
to
mascola
caused
the
furrows
in
blagg
s
brow
to
deepen
both
of
them
were
sore
at
the
girl
were
they
framing
up
if
they
were
he
d
block
the
boss
s
game
he
d
wise
her
she
d
always
shot
straight
enough
with
him
anyway
and
he
was
a
fool
to
have
ever
quit
her
if
mascola
was
baiting
the
russian
to
pull
off
some
dirty
work
he
d
blagg
paused
in
his
tentative
plans
for
outwitting
mascola
as
his
eye
fell
on
neilson
there
was
the
man
he
wanted
to
see
swan
could
swing
the
swedes
into
quitting
the
dago
all
thought
of
boris
vanished
from
blagg
s
the
big
swede
in
a
drunken
whisper
when
he
looked
about
for
the
russian
some
time
later
boris
was
gone
blagg
drained
the
contents
of
his
last
glass
with
a
wry
face
and
walked
unsteadily
to
the
door
colliding
with
a
man
on
the
sidewalk
he
regained
his
poise
by
leaning
heavily
against
a
sandwich
sign
board
hello
blagg
seen
any
of
my
men
inside
blagg
shoved
back
his
cap
and
eyed
the
speaker
with
drunken
suspicion
when
he
recognized
the
cannery
owner
a
furtive
light
crept
into
his
eyes
and
he
beckoned
gregory
closer
gregory
noted
the
mysterious
mien
and
promptly
credited
it
to
the
man
s
state
of
intoxication
he
was
on
the
point
of
hurrying
on
when
blagg
s
words
stayed
him
tell
lang
girl
t
look
out
for
self
what
do
you
mean
gregory
grasped
him
by
the
arm
and
whirled
him
about
was
in
s
loon
blagg
muttered
striving
to
focus
his
bleary
eyes
upon
his
auditor
him
an
boris
tol
em
he
was
t
fraid
no
woman
said
he
d
show
em
does
he
live
over
there
gregory
asked
quickly
pointing
toward
the
lang
hill
blagg
shook
his
head
and
nodded
in
the
opposite
direction
down
there
he
corrected
think
he
but
gregory
did
not
wait
to
hear
what
blagg
thought
blagg
looked
after
him
stupidly
he
had
had
no
time
to
speak
of
his
hatred
or
suspicion
of
mascola
but
he
d
show
the
dago
yet
a
crowd
of
fishermen
lumbered
along
the
sidewalk
toward
him
talking
excitedly
leaning
against
the
sign
board
blagg
was
able
to
gather
from
their
conversation
that
a
fight
had
just
occurred
at
the
red
paint
some
one
had
tried
to
get
square
with
the
boss
and
mascola
had
knifed
him
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
joe
blagg
s
forehead
to
his
whirling
brain
came
other
instances
he
had
heard
of
how
mascola
always
got
square
with
those
who
opposed
perhaps
he
had
gone
too
far
suppose
neilson
with
a
desire
to
get
in
strong
with
the
boss
should
tell
mascola
that
he
joe
blagg
was
trying
to
start
a
strike
among
the
alien
fishermen
and
a
swede
liked
to
talk
too
why
not
get
out
of
town
for
a
while
till
the
thing
blew
over
he
was
nt
afraid
of
the
dago
and
his
whole
crowd
but
what
was
the
use
of
starting
a
row
besides
he
was
ready
to
move
anyway
he
reflected
suddenly
that
the
midnight
train
for
frisco
stopped
at
legonia
on
signal
that
would
give
him
time
to
throw
his
stuff
together
he
had
already
drawn
his
money
why
not
hit
the
grit
as
jack
mccoy
took
his
way
down
the
hillside
he
was
acutely
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
evening
had
been
a
distinct
disappointment
why
was
gregory
there
anyway
that
talk
about
his
forgetting
his
papers
sounded
mighty
thin
how
many
times
had
the
boss
been
there
before
what
of
funny
did
nt
seem
to
care
whether
he
stayed
any
longer
or
not
mccoy
stopped
by
the
roadside
as
he
caught
sight
of
a
man
running
hastily
along
one
of
the
streets
leading
from
the
town
whoever
the
fellow
was
he
was
sure
in
a
hurry
the
way
he
was
cutting
cross
lots
as
the
runner
came
under
the
rays
of
the
corner
arc
light
mccoy
started
and
peered
intently
after
the
departing
figure
it
sure
looked
like
gregory
and
he
was
angling
in
the
direction
of
the
lang
hill
the
idea
clung
tenaciously
when
he
reached
his
rooming
house
it
became
an
obsession
he
decided
to
find
out
if
the
runner
could
have
been
his
employer
calling
up
the
cannery
it
was
some
time
before
a
sleepy
voice
answered
his
summons
boss
ai
nt
here
went
out
at
eight
and
ai
nt
been
back
since
want
to
leave
message
mccoy
snapped
up
the
receiver
and
walked
slowly
into
his
room
so
it
was
gregory
where
had
he
been
going
at
this
the
forgetting
of
the
paper
was
only
a
frame
up
dick
had
acted
funny
now
he
knew
it
was
because
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
he
sat
on
the
bed
making
no
effort
to
remove
his
clothes
you
re
a
poor
fish
something
whispered
why
do
nt
you
go
and
find
out
if
they
re
double
crossing
you
mccoy
tried
not
to
listen
for
a
long
time
he
stared
moodily
at
the
floor
then
he
rose
and
threw
off
his
coat
hastily
replaced
it
and
hurried
to
the
door
he
was
ashamed
of
his
but
you
absolutely
nothing
but
you
men
of
his
kind
do
not
love
long
they
love
violently
but
not
long
idle
improvident
men
such
as
he
is
are
able
to
crowd
a
whole
lot
of
love
into
a
very
short
space
of
time
that
is
because
they
have
nothing
much
else
to
do
they
run
through
with
love
as
they
run
through
with
money
quickly
the
man
who
wastes
money
will
also
waste
love
and
when
he
has
wasted
all
his
love
barry
lapelle
will
still
want
money
to
waste
be
good
enough
to
make
him
understand
that
he
will
never
have
a
dollar
of
my
money
to
waste
never
my
child
even
though
his
wife
were
starving
to
death
viola
stared
at
her
mother
incredulously
her
face
starve
your
own
daughter
i
why
mother
i
ca
nt
believe
you
would
be
so
i
mean
it
said
rachel
gwyn
compressing
her
lips
then
cried
viola
hotly
you
are
the
most
unnatural
cruel
mother
that
ever
stop
you
will
not
find
me
a
cruel
and
inhuman
mother
when
you
come
creeping
back
to
my
door
after
barry
lapelle
has
cast
you
off
i
am
only
asking
you
to
tell
him
what
he
may
expect
from
me
and
i
am
trying
hard
to
convince
you
of
what
you
may
expect
from
him
there
s
the
end
of
it
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
but
i
have
something
more
to
say
cried
the
girl
i
shall
tell
him
all
you
have
said
and
i
shall
marry
him
in
spite
of
everything
i
am
not
afraid
of
starving
i
do
nt
want
a
penny
of
father
s
money
he
did
not
choose
to
give
it
to
me
by
another
woman
he
ignored
me
he
cut
me
off
as
if
i
were
a
be
careful
my
child
warned
rachel
gwyn
her
eyes
narrowing
i
can
not
permit
you
to
question
his
acts
or
his
motives
he
did
what
he
thought
was
best
and
we
i
mean
you
and
i
must
abide
by
his
decision
i
am
not
questioning
your
husband
s
act
said
viola
stubbornly
i
am
questioning
my
father
s
act
mrs
gwyn
started
for
a
second
or
two
her
eyes
wavered
and
then
fell
one
corner
of
her
mouth
worked
curiously
then
without
a
word
she
turned
away
from
the
girl
and
left
the
room
viola
greatly
offended
heard
her
ascend
the
stairs
and
close
a
door
then
her
slow
heavy
tread
on
the
boards
above
suddenly
the
girl
s
anger
melted
the
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
oh
what
a
beast
i
was
to
hurt
her
like
that
she
aroused
her
ire
thinking
only
of
the
wonder
and
pain
that
had
lurked
in
her
mother
s
eyes
the
wonder
and
pain
of
a
whipped
dog
the
only
person
in
all
the
world
who
has
ever
really
loved
me
poor
poor
old
mother
she
stared
through
her
tears
at
the
flames
a
little
pucker
of
uncertainty
clouding
her
brow
i
am
sure
barry
never
never
can
love
me
as
she
does
or
be
as
kind
and
good
to
me
she
mused
i
wonder
i
wonder
if
what
she
says
is
true
about
men
i
wish
he
had
not
gone
to
drinking
to
day
but
i
suppose
the
poor
boy
really
could
nt
help
it
he
hates
so
to
be
disappointed
later
on
at
supper
she
abruptly
asked
mother
how
old
is
kenneth
they
had
spoken
not
more
than
a
dozen
words
to
each
other
since
sitting
down
to
table
which
was
set
as
usual
in
the
kitchen
both
were
thoughtful
started
out
of
a
profound
reverie
gave
her
daughter
a
sharp
inquiring
look
before
answering
i
do
not
know
twenty
five
or
six
i
suppose
did
you
know
his
mother
yes
after
a
perceptible
pause
how
long
after
she
died
were
you
and
father
married
your
father
had
been
a
widower
nearly
two
years
when
we
were
married
said
rachel
steadily
why
does
nt
kenneth
spell
his
name
as
we
do
gwyn
is
the
way
it
was
spelled
a
great
many
years
ago
and
it
is
the
correct
way
according
to
your
father
it
was
his
father
i
believe
who
added
the
last
two
letters
i
do
not
know
why
unless
it
was
supposed
to
be
more
elegant
it
seems
strange
that
he
should
spell
it
one
way
and
his
own
son
another
ventured
the
girl
unsatisfied
kenneth
was
brought
up
to
spell
it
in
the
new
fangled
way
i
you
need
not
ask
me
questions
about
the
family
viola
your
father
never
spoke
of
them
i
am
afraid
he
was
not
on
good
terms
with
them
he
was
a
strange
man
he
kept
things
to
himself
i
do
not
recollect
ever
hearing
him
mention
his
first
wife
or
his
son
or
any
other
member
of
his
family
in
well
in
twenty
years
or
more
i
should
think
you
would
have
been
a
little
bit
curious
i
know
i
should
i
knew
all
that
was
necessary
for
me
to
know
said
rachel
somewhat
brusquely
ca
nt
you
tell
me
something
more
about
father
s
people
persisted
the
girl
i
only
know
that
they
lived
in
baltimore
they
never
came
west
your
father
was
about
twenty
years
old
when
he
left
home
and
came
to
kentucky
that
is
all
i
know
so
do
not
ask
any
more
questions
he
never
acted
like
a
backwoodsman
said
viola
he
an
educated
man
he
came
of
a
good
family
and
you
are
different
from
the
women
we
used
to
see
down
the
river
goodness
i
was
proud
of
you
and
father
there

cried
all
right
but
let
me
say
this
my

way

or

but
you

that

mrs

exclaimed
faintly

i
my
dear
child
all
this

a

take
the

years
perhaps
years
real

social

the
results

not

but
why
this
impatience
i
got
i
have
i

a
reason
i
ca

take

i

allie
refused
to

we

start
in
to
day
and
we
ll
work
double
tower
till
one
of
us
plays
out
what
d
you
say
at
first
mrs
ring
took
this
energetic
declaration
with
some
reserve
but
before
long
she
realized
with
consternation
that
allie
briskow
was
in
deep
earnest
and
that
this
was
not
a
soft
berth
instead
of
obtaining
a
rest
she
was
being
worked
as
never
before
and
her
thirst
for
knowledge
was
insatiate
it
grew
daily
as
she
gained
fuller
understanding
of
her
ignorance
there
was
a
frantic
eagerness
to
her
efforts
almost
pitiful
as
time
went
on
she
began
to
hate
herself
for
her
stupidity
and
to
blame
her
people
for
her
condition
she
was
a
harder
taskmaster
than
her
teacher
most
things
she
apprehended
readily
enough
but
when
she
failed
to
learn
when
mental
or
physical
awkwardness
halted
progress
then
she
flew
into
a
fury
her
temper
appalled
mrs
ring
at
such
times
allie
was
more
than
disagreeable
hate
flamed
in
her
eyes
she
beat
herself
with
her
fists
she
kicked
the
furniture
and
she
broke
things
once
she
even
butted
her
head
against
the
wall
uttering
language
meanwhile
that
all
but
caused
her
companion
to
swoon
mrs
ring
resigned
after
this
final
exhibition
but
lacking
the
courage
to
face
allie
in
a
mood
like
that
she
went
to
gus
briskow
it
is
simply
impossible
to
remain
she
told
for
i
never
get
a
moment
s
rest
the
salary
is
attractive
but
allegheny
is
too
much
for
me
she
saps
every
ounce
of
vitality
i
have
she
keeps
me
going
every
hour
and
her
terrific
tempers
are
actually
dangerous
she
do
nt
ever
get
mad
at
you
does
she
oh
no
and
she
repents
quickly
enough
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
afraid
she
is
overdoing
her
studies
but
there
s
no
holding
her
back
you
re
kinda
worked
up
miz
ring
mebbe
i
can
make
it
pleasanter
for
you
in
what
way
may
i

well
by

you

you
are
generous
the
salary
we
agreed
upon
is

low

no

i
would
nt
feel
right
to
accept

try
it
ma
am
for
a
little
while
mebbe
it
wo
nt
bother
you
so
much
and
i
i
am
interested
in
her
she
is
progressing
too
in
fact
i
have
never
seen
anyone
learn
more
rapidly
but
she
is
so
unusual
still
perhaps
i
am
the
one
perhaps
it
is
my
duty
under
the
circumstances
with
this
disposition
to
compromise
the
father
had
little
difficulty
in
dealing
so
the
daily
routine
was
continued
allie
applied
herself
to
the
cultivation
of
the
ordinary
social
niceties
with
the
same
zeal
that
she
followed
her
studies
and
her
physical
exercises
fortunately
these
exercises
afforded
outlet
for
the
impatience
and
the
scorn
that
she
felt
for
herself
otherwise
there
would
have
been
no
living
with
her
as
it
was
she
showed
herself
no
mercy
daylight
found
her
stirring
her
swedish
drill
she
took
with
a
vigor
that
fairly
shook
the
floor
and
having
finished
this
she
donned
sweater
and
boots
and
went
for
a
swift
walk
over
the
hills
at
this
hour
she
had
the
roads
to
herself
and
was
glad
of
it
she
had
a
ravenous
appetite
she
ate
sparingly
the
day
was
spent
in
reading
aloud
by
the
ones
for
whom
she
works
and
prays
if
elizabeth
hall
had
known
and
if
her
boys
had
known
what
lay
just
ahead
perhaps
the
days
would
have
been
made
fuller
yet
of
loving
counsel
and
happy
association
but
the
veil
was
before
their
faces
and
they
did
not
know
possibly
that
was
best
if
the
veil
were
lifted
and
us
it
is
enough
that
for
each
day
is
given
grace
for
its
toils
elizabeth
loved
her
boys
and
was
giving
them
the
best
of
herself
and
that
is
all
she
could
have
done
if
she
had
known
chapter
the
stricken
home
henry
hill
sat
before
the
fire
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
a
picture
of
utter
dejection
and
sorrow
the
house
was
quiet
with
an
unearthly
quietness
those
who
were
compelled
to
speak
using
the
lowest
tones
and
tiptoeing
about
the
little
ones
doyle
lila
and
harry
were
not
at
home
amy
and
nell
were
silently
tearfully
trying
to
wash
the
few
dishes
that
had
been
used
at
the
almost
untouched
breakfast
the
boys
were
attending
to
the
morning
chores
with
faces
as
solemn
and
hearts
as
heavy
as
each
could
carry
a
neighbor
woman
kind
sympathetic
and
busy
but
with
the
same
sadness
pictured
upon
her
face
kept
coming
and
going
between
the
bedroom
and
the
room
physician
had
been
there
and
had
told
them
that
she
whose
life
had
been
the
light
and
strength
of
the
home
was
lying
now
upon
her
death
bed
that
she
would
never
again
rise
to
take
the
burdens
of
life
that
they
would
have
to
let
her
go
he
had
felt
for
henry
hill
as
he
had
spoken
for
the
white
horror
and
anguish
in
the
man
s
face
would
have
called
out
sympathy
from
a
harder
heart
but
he
wanted
to
say
also
that
had
she
been
given
a
lighter
load
to
carry
if
some
of
the
anxiety
and
concern
that
now
stirred
his
heart
had
been
expressed
when
his
wife
was
well
things
might
not
now
be
as
they
are
but
the
kind
doctor
left
these
words
unsaid
henry
hill
had
all
he
could
bear
without
them
the
holidays
with
their
festivities
were
over
and
life
had
just
settled
back
into
its
every
day
way
when
elizabeth
hill
fell
sick
she
had
never
been
ailing
before
her
children
had
always
known
her
as
able
to
without
her
they
were
helpless
and
distraught
for
there
was
no
one
to
take
her
place
and
when
after
one
day
s
illness
it
became
certain
that
her
condition
was
critical
the
anxiety
and
tension
became
intense
he
who
should
have
lightened
her
burden
long
ago
now
awoke
to
her
need
and
was
constantly
by
her
side
doing
all
that
was
in
his
power
to
restore
her
to
health
but
the
black
cloud
settled
heavier
upon
the
home
as
each
day
saw
the
mother
coming
nearer
the
gates
of
death
the
children
looked
at
one
another
with
pale
faces
and
wide
frightened
eyes
as
they
saw
the
kind
neighbor
women
come
from
their
mother
s
bed
with
averted
faces
though
all
was
done
that
could
be
done
they
could
not
hold
her
and
one
night
with
her
weeping
family
around
her
she
loosed
from
her
earthly
habitation
and
went
away
she
who
had
been
the
soul
of
that
home
lay
dead
the
calamity
came
upon
the
family
like
a
shock
it
left
no
spirit
nor
turn
from
the
father
down
to
baby
doyle
they
were
bereft
she
to
whom
they
had
always
looked
for
counsel
and
guidance
lay
in
a
sublime
sleep
from
which
they
could
not
waken
her
as
henry
hill
looked
upon
the
motionless
form
of
the
woman
whose
love
and
confidence
he
had
gained
and
who
had
been
to
him
such
a
faithful
wife
in
spite
of
his
fickleness
he
wept
and
vowed
but
what
are
tears
and
vows
when
the
will
has
been
weakened
by
self
indulgence
he
looked
about
him
helplessly
what
was
he
to
do
what
could
he
do
without
her
he
was
almost
a
stranger
to
his
children
and
had
no
idea
how
to
care
for
them
she
had
always
carried
the
burden
taken
the
oversight
been
the
one
to
go
ahead
he
faced
the
future
as
helplessly
as
one
of
his
little
children
her
boys
looked
upon
her
and
knew
that
they
had
lost
their
best
friend
home
would
have
little
more
attraction
for
them
george
and
wilbur
took
selfish
comfort
to
care
for
themselves
but
austin
forgot
himself
in
wondering
what
would
become
of
the
children
the
little
ones
spoke
to
mama
but
she
did
not
answer
they
called
to
her
but
she
did
not
hear
and
they
went
away
weeping
for
though
they
could
not
tell
what
they
knew
something
dreadful
had
happened
kind
friends
and
neighbors
came
in
and
did
what
has
to
be
done
at
such
a
time
they
pitied
with
full
hearts
the
afflicted
family
and
they
wept
for
their
friend
for
they
too
had
loved
her
they
took
her
and
laid
her
with
others
of
death
s
sleepers
in
the
silent
churchyard
and
her
orphaned
children
returned
with
their
helpless
father
to
the
lonely
and
broken
home
only
those
who
have
returned
home
after
mother
is
gone
know
what
these
children
and
father
suffered
kind
hands
had
put
the
house
in
order
and
the
familiar
furniture
in
its
accustomed
place
endeavoring
to
make
the
house
look
as
if
all
were
well
but
they
could
not
bring
back
the
the
children
it
was
a
dreary
lonely
place
fearfully
they
crept
out
of
doors
only
to
find
it
as
cheerless
there
that
first
night
around
the
fireside
without
her
what
a
desolate
place
it
was
the
father
sat
with
drooped
head
and
heaving
breast
and
the
children
huddled
together
and
some
of
them
sobbed
just
to
escape
their
misery
they
went
early
to
bed
and
little
pillows
were
wet
with
tears
when
they
were
the
form
across
the
glade
was
no
longer
motionless
straining
ben
saw
the
soft
roll
of
a
great
shadow
almost
imperceptible
in
the
gloom
advancing
slowly
toward
him
then
the
faint
glow
of
the
fire
caught
and
reflected
in
the
creature
s
eyes
they
suddenly
glowed
out
in
the
half
darkness
two
rather
small
circles
of
dark
visitor
was
not
moose
or
caribou
or
was
it
one
of
the
lesser
hunters
lynx
or
wolverine
or
a
panther
wandered
far
from
his
accustomed
haunts
the
twin
circles
were
too
far
above
the
ground
and
whatever
it
was
no
doubt
remained
but
that
the
creature
was
steadily
stalking
him
across
the
soft
grass
at
that
instant
ben
s
muscles
snapped
into
action
only
a
second
remained
in
which
to
make
his
defense
the
creature
had
paused
setting
his
muscles
for
a
death
dealing
charge
go
back
into
the
cave
as
far
as
you
can
he
said
swiftly
to
beatrice
his
own
eyes
squinted
and
straining
for
the
last
iota
of
vision
in
that
darkened
scene
made
a
last
frantic
search
for
his
rifle
suddenly
he
saw
the
gleam
of
its
barrel
as
it
rested
against
the
wall
of
the
cliff
fifteen
feet
distant
at
once
he
knew
that
his
only
course
was
to
spring
for
it
in
the
instant
that
remained
and
trust
to
its
mighty
shocking
power
yet
it
seemed
to
tear
the
life
fiber
of
the
man
to
do
it
his
inmost
instincts
urgent
and
loud
in
his
ear
told
him
to
remain
on
guard
not
to
leave
that
cavern
maw
for
an
instant
but
to
protect
with
his
own
body
the
precious
life
that
it
sheltered
his
mind
worked
with
that
incredible
speed
that
is
usually
manifest
in
a
crisis
and
he
knew
that
the
creature
might
charge
into
the
cavern
entrance
in
the
second
that
he
left
it
yet
only
in
the
rifle
lay
the
least
chance
or
hope
for
either
of
them
at
him
fenris
he
shouted
the
wolf
leaped
forward
like
a
thrown
spear
almost
too
fast
for
the
eye
to
follow
he
was
deathly
afraid
with
full
knowledge
of
the
power
of
the
enemy
he
went
to
combat
but
his
fears
were
impotent
to
restrain
him
at
the
first
sound
of
that
masterful
voice
these
were
the
words
he
had
waited
for
he
could
never
disobey
such
words
as
these
mind
had
worked
true
he
knew
that
the
wolf
could
likely
hold
the
creature
at
bay
until
he
could
seize
his
rifle
in
an
instant
it
was
in
his
hands
and
he
had
sprung
back
to
his
post
in
front
of
the
cavern
maw
and
presently
he
remembered
heartsick
that
the
weapon
was
not
loaded
for
his
own
safety
he
had
kept
it
empty
on
the
outward
journey
partly
to
prevent
accident
partly
to
be
sure
that
his
prisoner
could
not
turn
it
against
him
but
he
had
shells
in
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
his
hand
groped
but
his
reaching
fingers
found
but
one
shell
dropping
it
swiftly
into
the
gun
and
now
he
knew
that
no
time
remained
to
seek
another
the
beast
in
the
darkness
had
launched
into
the
charge
thereafter
there
was
only
a
great
confusion
event
piled
upon
event
with
incredible
rapidity
and
a
whole
lifetime
of
stress
and
fear
lived
in
a
single
instant
the
creature
s
first
lunge
carried
him
into
the
brighter
moonlight
could
mistake
the
high
rocking
shoulders
the
burly
form
the
wicked
ears
laid
back
against
the
flat
massive
head
the
fangs
gleaming
white
the
long
hooked
claws
slashing
through
the
turf
as
he
ran
it
was
a
terrible
thing
to
see
and
stand
against
in
the
half
darkness
the
shadows
accentuated
the
towering
outline
and
forgotten
terrors
lurking
since
the
world
was
young
in
the
labyrinth
of
the
germ
plasm
wakened
and
spread
like
icy
streams
through
the
mortal
body
and
seemed
to
threaten
to
extinguish
the
warm
flame
of
the
very
soul
the
grizzly
bawled
as
he
came
an
explosive
incredible
storm
of
sound
few
indeed
are
the
wilderness
creatures
that
can
charge
in
silence
muscular
exertion
can
not
alone
relieve
their
gathered
flood
of
madness
and
fury
and
at
once
ben
sensed
the
impulse
behind
the
attack
he
and
the
girl
had
made
their
home
in
the
grizzly
s
cave
perhaps
the
lair
wherein
he
had
hibernated
through
the
winter
and
which
he
still
slept
in
from
time
out
only
death
could
pay
for
such
insolence
as
this
to
make
a
night
s
lair
in
the
den
of
his
sovereignty
the
grizzly
it
is
not
the
accustomed
thing
for
a
grizzly
to
make
an
unprovoked
attack
he
has
done
it
many
times
in
the
history
of
the
west
but
usually
he
is
glad
enough
to
turn
aside
only
launching
into
his
terrible
death
charge
when
a
mortal
wound
obliterates
his
fear
of
man
leaving
only
his
fear
of
death
but
this
grizzly
native
to
these
uninhabited
wilds
had
no
fear
of
man
to
forget
he
did
not
know
what
man
was
and
he
had
not
learned
the
death
that
dwells
in
the
shining
weapon
he
carries
in
his
arms
no
trappers
mushed
through
his
snows
of
spring
no
woodsman
rode
his
winding
trails
true
from
the
first
instant
that
the
human
smell
had
reached
him
on
the
wind
he
had
been
disturbed
and
discomfited
yet
it
was
not
grizzly
nature
to
yield
his
den
without
a
fight
the
sight
only
wakened
an
added
rage
in
his
fierce
heart
the
wolf
met
him
at
his
first
leap
springing
with
noble
courage
at
his
grizzled
throat
and
the
bear
paused
in
his
charge
to
strike
him
away
he
lashed
out
with
his
great
forepaw
and
if
that
blow
had
gone
straight
home
the
ribs
of
the
wolf
would
have
been
smashed
flat
on
his
heart
and
lungs
the
tough
trunk
of
a
young
spruce
would
have
been
broken
as
quickly
under
that
terrible
blasting
full
stroke
of
a
grizzly
the
largest
grizzly
weighs
but
of
the
coming
moon
to
the
west
was
a
chaos
of
unfamiliar
peaks
when
the
dusk
of
the
mountain
slope
before
him
turned
to
radiant
silver
douglas
started
the
horses
on
and
spurred
tom
relentlessly
and
if
he
had
known
how
to
pray
he
told
himself
he
would
have
asked
the
almighty
to
give
him
strength
for
the
tremendous
venture
which
lay
before
him

douglas
spurred
tom
relentlessly
until
the
snow
was
belly
deep
and
both
animals
began
to
fight
obstinately
to
turn
back
douglas
dismounted
and
fastened
the
horses
to
a
scrub
cedar
then
he
wallowed
forward
afoot
to
break
trail
the
wind
increased
constantly
with
the
elevation
but
even
higher
than
its
eerie
note
sounded
the
wild
call
of
a
solitary
coyote
douglas
heard
the
call
but
remotely
his
he
beat
trail
until
his
lungs
protested
then
he
brought
the
horses
forward
halted
and
beat
trail
again
his
nose
was
bleeding
slightly
when
he
at
last
won
to
the
crest
of
the
first
shoulder
this
was
blown
clear
of
snow
and
he
mounted
and
rode
well
up
on
the
second
shoulder
before
the
horses
again
balked
lost
chief
range
now
had
dropped
so
that
dimly
beyond
he
could
glimpse
the
indian
peaks
the
strange
peaks
to
the
right
were
subsiding
to
be
dwarfed
by
still
other
peaks
against
which
the
stars
floated
pendulous
and
brilliant
and
still
black
devil
s
top
was
invisible
beyond
the
terraced
ridge
that
opposed
the
little
cavalcade
when
after
infinite
effort
douglas
surmounted
the
third
shoulder
he
paused
appalled
by
the
loneliness
and
danger
of
the
position
the
ridge
had
narrowed
until
its
top
offered
barely
a
foothold
with
sides
dropping
to
unthinkable
depths
the
snow
had
blown
clear
and
the
wind
was
almost
insupportable
a
cedar
stood
before
them
like
a
sentinal
guarding
the
eternal
were
his
last
hope
as
the
horses
brought
up
in
the
shelter
of
the
tree
douglas
gave
a
hoarse
cry
of
relief
and
dismounted
some
charred
sticks
and
the
remains
of
a
cottontail
had
not
yet
blown
away
douglas
examined
the
traces
of
the
hasty
camp
then
chuckled
safe
so
far
some
girl
my
judith
then
his
jaw
stiffened
and
he
set
the
horses
to
the
last
shoulder
below
the
pass
groaning
trembling
bloody
flanks
heaving
fighting
constantly
to
turn
tom
when
douglas
sought
to
force
him
through
the
drift
that
topped
the
shoulder
deliberately
lay
down
douglas
freed
himself
from
the
stirrups
and
jerked
the
horse
to
his
feet

the
pack
horse
had
embraced
the
opportunity
s
tirade
did
his
not
inconsiderable
best
to
kick
his
mate
then
he
snapped
at
douglas
who
promptly
cuffed
him
on
the
nose
tom
reared
fell
and
began
to
roll
down
the
terrible
slope
the
pack
horse
did
not
waken
nor
stir
doug
flung
himself
after
tom
slipping
falling
rolling
he
finally
caught
the
reins
and
though
tom
dragged
him
fifty
yards
on
downward
he
at
last
braced
his
spurs
against
a
boulder
the
reins
held
and
tom
brought
up
trembling
and
coughing
and
now
horse
and
man
could
only
stand
for
a
long
time
struggling
for
breath
when
his
numbing
hands
gave
warning
that
his
rest
period
must
cease
douglas
with
the
reins
caught
over
his
elbow
began
a
fight
back
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
a
fight
to
which
the
previous
portion
of
the
trip
had
been
as
nothing
when
they
reached
the
led
horse
still
sleeping
with
his
nose
between
his
fore
legs
there
was
no
more
fight
left
in
tom
and
was
setting
when
he
led
his
little
train
through
the
gigantic
drift
to
the
long
slope
which
lifted
to
the
pass
there
was
no
snow
here
the
slope
as
far
as
doug
could
discern
in
the
failing
light
was
a
glare
of
rough
ice
over
this
he
dared
not
urge
the
horses
until
daylight
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
nearly
five
o
clock
he
fastened
the
horses
to
the
only
cedar
in
sight
then
stood
in
the
wind
debating
with
himself
he
was
very
much
exhausted
and
the
rare
air
and
the
intense
cold
were
giving
him
no
chance
to
recoup
this
was
no
place
to
make
camp
the
tiny
cedar
offered
neither
shelter
from
the
wind
nor
an
adequate
amount
of
fuel
and
up
here
in
this
hostile
loneliness
his
anxiety
over
judith
returned
threefold
strong
as
she
was
clever
as
she
was
she
was
as
open
to
accidents
as
he
supposing
her
horses
had
slipped
on
this
ice
and
had
gone
over
the
black
edge
douglas
dropped
to
surface
a
hundred
yards
of
this
and
he
brought
to
pause
before
a
giant
boulder
beside
which
grew
several
dwarf
cedars
he
drew
his
ax
from
its
sheath
and
after
long
effort
with
his
stiffened
fingers
he
got
the
green
wood
to
burning
dawn
about
seven
found
him
napping
against
the
warm
face
of
the
rock
he
brought
the
horses
up
to
the
camp
fed
them
and
himself
and
as
the
sun
shot
over
the
indian
range
then
prepared
to
lead
the
horses
onward
the
crest
of
black
devil
now
lifted
immediately
above
him
just
below
the
crest
a
ledge
broad
enough
for
a
pack
team
led
straight
into
the
blue
of
the
sky
to
the
right
the
dark
wall
of
the
crest
to
the
left
a
sheer
drop
where
the
canyon
between
lost
chief
range
and
black
devil
yawned
hideously
this
ledge
this
narrow
painful
crossing
made
the
pass
douglas
drew
his
ax
and
prepared
to
roughen
a
trail
over
the
ice
for
the
horses
but
to
his
unspeakable
that
another
ax
curious
and
timid
johnnie
what
small
feet
and
little
hands
you
have
you
re
a
regular
aristocrat
a
pause
i
give
her
a
poem
written
to
her
she
reads
it
letting
her
knife
stick
in
a
half
peeled
potato
she
looks
up
at
me
out
of
heavy
lidded
eyes
i
believe
you
re
falling
in
love
with
me
i
trembled
answered
nothing
was
silent
kiss
me
seeing
me
so
a
tremble
she
obeyed
her
own
injunction
with
slow
deliberation
she
crushed
her
lips
full
and
voluptuous
into
mine
the
warmth
of
them
seemed
to
catch
hold
of
something
deep
down
in
me
and
with
exquisite
i
clutched
close
to
her
she
laughed
i
put
one
hand
over
her
full
breast
as
infants
do
she
pushed
me
back
there
that
s
enough
for
one
day
a
promise
of
sweets
to
come
and
she
laughed
again
with
a
hearty
purr
like
a
cat
that
has
a
mouse
at
its
mercy
she
rose
and
carried
in
the
pan
of
potatoes
we
had
just
finished
peeling
and
i
saw
her
sturdy
but
not
unshapely
ankles
going
from
me
as
she
went
up
the
steps
from
the
yard
her
legs
gleaming
white
through
her
half
silk
hose
that
were
always
coming
down
and
that
she
was
always
twisting
up
just
under
her
knees
before
my
abashed
eyes
she
wore
shoes
much
too
little
for
her
plump
feet
and
when
not
abroad
let
them
yawn
open
unbuttoned
and
her
plump
body
was
alive
and
bursting
through
her
careless
half
fastened
clothes
she
sang
with
a
deep
sultriness
of
voice
as
she
walked
away
with
the
pan
of
potatoes
florrie
read
books
exclaimed
the
mother
flora
did
read
a
lot
but
chiefly
the
erotic
near
society
novels
that
belford
used
to
print
yes
she
s
a
smart
girl
she
is
and
the
father
i
wo
nt
work
till
the
unions
get
better
conditions
for
a
man
i
wo
nt
be
no
slave
to
no
man
one
sultry
afternoon
i
went
into
the
restaurant
and
found
flora
away
poignantly
disappointed
i
asked
where
she
was
gone
on
a
trip
her
mother
explained
without
explaining
from
time
to
time
flora
went
on
trips
and
one
morning
several
mornings
flora
was
not
there
to
serve
at
the
breakfast
table
and
i
was
hurt
when
i
learned
that
she
had
gone
back
to
newark
to
live
and
had
left
no
word
for
me
her
father
told
me
she
had
gone
back
to
george
meaning
her
never
seen
husband
from
whom
she
evidently
and
hurt
indeed
because
she
had
not
even
said
good
bye
to
me
but
soon
came
this
brief
note
from
her
dearest
boy
do
come
up
to
newark
and
see
me
some
afternoon
and
come
more
than
once
bring
your
tennyson
that
you
was
reading
aloud
to
me
i
love
to
hear
you
read
poetry
i
think
you
are
a
dear
and
want
to
see
more
of
you
but
i
suppose
you
have
already
forgotten
your
loving
flora
in
the
absurd
and
pitiful
folly
of
youth
i
lifted
the
letter
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
i
trembled
with
eagerness
till
the
paper
rattled
as
i
read
it
again
and
again
it
seemed
like
some
precious
holy
script
i
bolted
my
lunch
nervously
and
it
stuck
half
way
down
in
a
hard
lump
i
would
go
to
her
that
very
afternoon
the
car
on
which
i
rode
was
subject
to
too
frequent
stoppage
for
me
i
leaped
out
and
walked
along
with
brisk
strides
but
the
car
of
roadway
and
i
ran
after
it
to
catch
it
again
the
conductor
looked
back
at
me
in
derisive
scorn
and
made
a
significant
whirling
motion
near
his
temple
with
his
index
finger
indicating
that
i
had
wheels
there
at
last
i
found
the
street
where
flora
lived
i
trailed
from
door
to
door
till
the
number
she
had
given
me
met
my
eye
it
made
my
heart
jump
and
my
knees
give
in
to
be
so
near
the
quarry
for
the
first
time
i
was
to
be
alone
with
a
woman
i
desired
at
the
bell
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
gain
courage
to
pull
but
at
last
i
reached
out
my
hand
i
had
to
stand
my
ground
i
could
nt
run
away
now
the
bell
made
a
tinkling
sound
far
within
the
door
opened
cautiously
a
head
of
touseled
black
hair
crept
out
johnnie
dear
you
you
are
a
surprise
did
i
really
detect
an
echo
of
disappointment
heart
like
a
trapped
animal
i
went
in
down
a
long
dusk
musty
smelling
corridor
and
into
a
back
apartment
on
the
first
floor
she
led
me
into
a
room
which
was
bed
and
sitting
room
combined
in
one
part
of
it
stood
several
upholstered
chairs
with
covers
on
cluttered
about
a
plain
table
in
the
other
part
stood
a
bureau
heaped
with
promiscuous
toilette
articles
and
a
huge
brass
knobbed
bed
with
a
spread
of
lace
over
its
great
semi
upright
pillows
shall
i
let
in
a
little
more
light
dear
do
for
the
blinds
were
two
thirds
down
i
like
to
sit
and
think
in
the
dark
she
explained
and
her
one
dimple
broke
in
a
rich
brown
faced
animal
smile
yes
but
i
i
want
to
see
your
lovely
face
i
stuttered
with
much
effort
at
gallantry
he
s
not
at
home
he
s
off
at
wilmington
on
a
job
meaning
her
husband
though
what
made
you
come
so
soon
you
must
of
just
got
my
letter
i
i
wanted
you
i
blurted
in
the
next
moment
i
was
at
her
feet
in
approved
romantic
fashion
following
up
my
declaration
of
desire
calmly
she
let
me
kneel
there
i
put
my
arms
about
her
plump
legs
i
was
almost
fainting
after
a
while
she
took
me
by
the
hair
with
both
hands
she
slowly
bent
my
head
back
as
i
knelt
leaning
over
she
kissed
deliberately
deeply
into
my
mouth

christmas
outside
of
eden
i
beneath
the
holly
on
the
eve
of
christmas
they
have
told
it
every
christmas
eve
since
the
world
started
they
commenced
telling
it
long
before
christ
was
born
for
their
memory
goes
further
back
than
men
s
the
christmas
which
they
celebrate
began
just
outside
of
eden
within
sight
of
its
gold
locked
doors
the
robins
have
only
two
stories
one
for
christmas
and
one
for
easter
their
easter
story
is
quite
different
it
has
to
do
with
how
they
got
the
splash
of
red
upon
their
breasts
it
was
when
god
s
son
was
hanging
on
the
cross
they
wanted
to
do
something
to
spare
him
they
were
too
weak
to
pull
out
the
nails
from
his
feet
and
hands
so
they
tore
their
little
breasts
in
plucking
the
thorns
one
by
one
from
the
crown
that
had
been
set
upon
his
forehead
since
then
god
has
allowed
their
breasts
to
remain
red
as
a
remembrance
of
his
gratitude
but
their
christmas
story
happened
long
before
when
they
were
nt
robin
red
breasts
but
only
robins
they
twitter
it
in
a
chuckling
fashion
to
their
children
if
you
prefer
to
hear
it
first
hand
creep
out
to
the
nearest
holly
bush
on
almost
any
christmas
eve
when
snow
has
made
the
night
all
pale
and
shadowy
if
the
robins
have
chosen
your
holly
bush
as
their
rendezvous
and
you
understand
their
language
you
wo
nt
need
to
read
what
i
have
written
like
all
true
stories
it
is
much
better
told
than
read
it
s
the
story
of
the
first
laugh
that
was
ever
heard
in
earth
or
heaven
to
be
enjoyed
properly
it
needs
the
chuckling
twitter
of
the
grown
up
robins
and
the
squeaky
interruptions
of
the
baby
birds
asking
questions
when
they
get
terrifically
excited
they
jig
up
and
down
on
the
holly
branches
and
the
frozen
snow
falls
with
a
brittle
clatter
then
the
mother
and
father
birds
say
hush
quite
suddenly
no
one
speaks
for
a
full
five
seconds
they
huddle
closer
listening
and
holding
their
breath
that
s
how
the
story
ought
to
be
heard
little
boys
and
girls
have
gone
to
bed
early
having
hung
up
their
very
biggest
stockings
of
course
i
ca
nt
tell
it
that
way
on
paper
but
i
ll
do
my
best
to
repeat
the
precise
words
in
which
the
robins
tell
it
ii
it
was
very
long
ago
at
the
beginning
of
all
wonders
sun
moon
and
stars
were
new
they
wandered
about
in
the
clouds
uncertainly
calling
to
one
another
like
ships
in
a
fog
it
was
the
same
on
earth
neither
trees
nor
rivers
nor
animals
were
quite
sure
why
they
had
been
created
or
what
was
expected
of
them
they
were
terribly
afraid
of
doing
wrong
and
they
had
good
reason
for
the
man
and
woman
had
done
wrong
and
had
been
locked
out
of
eden
that
had
happened
in
april
when
the
world
was
three
months
old
up
to
that
time
everything
had
gone
very
well
no
one
had
known
what
fear
was
no
one
had
guessed
that
anything
existed
outside
the
walls
of
eden
or
trees
and
rivers
had
lived
together
with
the
man
and
the
woman
in
the
high
walled
garden
as
a
happy
family
if
they
had
wanted
to
know
anything
they
had
asked
the
man
he
had
always
given
them
answers
even
though
he
had
to
invent
them
they
had
never
dreamt
of
doubting
him
not
even
the
woman
the
reason
for
this
had
been
god
every
afternoon
god
had
come
stepping
down
from
the
sky
to
walk
with
the
man
through
the
sun
spangled
shadows
of
the
grassy
paths
they
had
heard
the
kindly
rumble
of
his
voice
like
distant
thunder
and
the
little
tones
of
the
man
as
he
asked
his
questions
at
six
o
clock
regularly
god
had
shaken
hands
with
the
man
and
climbed
leisurely
back
up
the
sky
blue
stairs
that
led
to
heaven
because
of
this
the
man
had
gained
a
reputation
among
the
animals
for
being
wise
they
had
thought
of
him
as
god
s
friend
he
had
given
orders
to
everybody
even
to
the
woman
and
everyone
had
been
proud
to
obey
him
it
had
been
been
all
kinds
of
rumours
the
first
that
had
been
suspected
had
been
when
god
had
failed
to
come
for
his
customary
walk
the
next
had
been
when
he
had
arrived
with
his
face
hidden
in
anger
the
trees
of
eden
had
bent
and
clashed
as
if
a
strong
wind
were
blowing
everything
living
that
was
not
rooted
had
run
away
to
hide
nevertheless
when
god
had
called
to
the
man
they
had
tiptoed
nearer
to
listen
the
trouble
had
seemed
to
be
about
some
fruit
god
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
not
pluck
it
he
had
not
only
plucked
it
but
had
eaten
of
it
so
had
the
woman
it
had
seemed
a
small
matter
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
they
had
supposed
that
god
s
anger
would
soon
blow
over
and
that
everything
would
be
again
as
friendly
as
before
illustration
god
had
given
the
the
rights
of
but
when
it
comes
to
raising
the
price
of
food
still
higher
and
cutting
off
the
city
milk
supply
well
when
they
talk
of
that
then
i
begin
to
think
of
the
human
side
of
it
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
concluded
in
a
less
serious
tone
that
s
the
only
thing
in
the
whole
business
i
care
about
the
human
side
of
it
all
a
phrase
of
benham
s
floated
suddenly
into
her
mind
and
she
found
herself
repeating
it
aloud
there
are
no
human
rights
where
a
principle
is
involved
vetch
laughed
that
s
not
you
it
s
benham
i
recognize
it
he
s
the
sort
that
would
believe
that
i
suppose
the
sort
that
would
write
a
political
document
in
blood
if
he
did
nt
have
ink
oh
do
nt
she
protested
there
was
a
grain
of
truth
in
the
epigram
but
she
resented
it
the
more
keenly
for
this
well
i
may
have
intended
it
as
a
compliment
way
i
reckon
and
anyhow
you
have
heard
him
make
worse
flings
at
me
she
coloured
admitting
and
denying
at
the
same
time
the
truth
of
his
words
you
could
never
understand
each
other
you
are
so
different
he
looked
at
her
gravely
but
even
gravity
could
not
wholly
drive
the
gleam
of
humour
from
his
eyes
at
any
rate
i
admire
benham
i
have
the
advantage
of
him
there
the
quickness
of
his
wit
made
her
smile
but
as
you
say
we
are
different
he
added
after
a
moment
i
reckon
i
ve
turned
my
hand
at
times
to
jobs
of
which
benham
would
disapprove
but
i
d
be
hanged
before
i
d
write
the
greatest
document
ever
penned
in
well
in
the
blood
of
one
of
those
squirrels
out
yonder
in
the
square
as
he
finished
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
window
and
following
his
gaze
she
saw
the
sunlight
sparkling
like
amber
wine
on
the
as
she
looked
back
at
him
she
wondered
what
his
past
could
have
been
how
deep
how
complex
how
varied
was
his
experience
of
life
she
was
aware
again
of
that
curiously
primitive
attraction
which
she
had
felt
the
other
afternoon
in
the
shop
it
was
as
if
he
appealed
not
to
the
beliefs
and
sentiments
with
which
life
had
obscured
and
muffled
her
nature
but
to
some
buried
self
beneath
the
self
that
she
and
the
world
knew
to
some
ancient
instinct
which
was
as
deep
as
the
oldest
forests
of
earth
after
all
was
there
a
hidden
self
a
buried
forest
within
her
soul
which
she
had
never
discovered
but
patty
has
not
given
you
her
message
she
exclaimed
startled
and
confused
by
the
strangeness
of
the
sensation
oh
there
is
nt
much
to
tell
answered
patty
wondering
if
she
could
ever
learn
even
if
she
practised
every
day
to
speak
and
move
like
corinna
it
was
only
that
you
ought
to
stand
by
repeated
vetch
then
he
drew
in
his
breath
with
a
whistling
sound
well
i
like
his
impudence
he
exclaimed
corinna
rose
with
a
laugh
so
do
i
she
observed
and
he
seems
to
possess
it
in
abundance
then
she
folded
patty
in
a
light
and
fragrant
embrace
you
must
be
the
belle
of
the
ball
she
said
i
have
a
genius
for
being
a
chaperon
when
she
had
gone
and
they
watched
her
car
pass
the
monument
the
girl
turned
back
into
the
hall
with
her
hand
clinging
tightly
to
vetch
s
arm
father
what
do
you
suppose
that
message
meant
is
it
obliged
to
mean
anything
things
generally
do
do
nt
they
vetch
smiled
as
he
looked
down
at
her
but
his
smile
conveyed
anxiety
rather
than
amusement
to
her
observant
eyes
oh
if
things
are
said
by
gershom
they
generally
mean
hell
night
there
s
to
be
a
meeting
then
and
it
looks
as
if
somebody
might
make
trouble
then
he
patted
her
shoulder
do
nt
worry
about
gershom
honey
he
added
in
the
way
he
used
to
speak
when
she
fell
and
hurt
herself
as
a
child
do
nt
worry
your
mind
about
gershom
i
ll
take
care
of
him
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
tell
him
that
she
was
not
worrying
about
gershom
but
about
the
woman
dying
all
alone
in
that
dark
room
in
leigh
street
if
he
had
only
looked
less
disturbed
she
might
have
done
so
and
when
she
thought
of
it
afterward
she
understood
that
frankness
would
have
been
by
far
the
wiser
course
however
while
she
wondered
what
she
ought
to
say
the
opportunity
slipped
by
and
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
on
his
desk
called
him
away
from
her
corinna
meanwhile
was
rolling
down
the
drive
over
the
slanting
shadows
of
the
linden
trees
she
it
was
about
vetch
that
made
her
believe
in
him
so
profoundly
when
she
was
with
him
and
yet
begin
to
distrust
him
as
soon
as
she
got
far
enough
away
to
gain
a
perspective
gossip
probably
she
reflected
when
she
was
with
him
her
confidence
was
the
natural
response
of
her
own
unbiassed
perceptions
when
she
left
him
she
passed
immediately
into
an
atmosphere
that
was
charged
with
the
suspicions
of
other
people
she
remembered
the
stories
true
or
false
which
had
been
hinted
and
whispered
before
the
last
election
malicious
gossip
that
and
as
unfounded
no
doubt
as
the
rest
she
recalled
the
muttered
insinuations
of
fraudulent
political
stratagems
of
what
benham
had
called
the
governor
s
weathercock
principles
in
vetch
s
presence
she
realized
that
she
invariably
lost
sight
of
these
structural
or
surface
blemishes
and
judged
him
by
some
standard
which
was
different
from
the
one
she
had
inherited
with
the
shape
of
her
nose
and
the
colour
of
her
eyes
what
troubled
her
was
not
so
much
the
riddle
of
vetch
world
beyond
the
one
she
had
always
inhabited
and
that
this
other
world
was
filled
like
her
own
with
obscure
moral
and
spiritual
images
as
having
seen
the
world
and
its
splendors
said
it
was
interesting
but
that
they
would
prefer
to
live
at
home
these
days
america
is
an
unhappy
land
said
jack
we
are
like
a
wildcat
in
captivity
a
growling
quarrelsome
lot
well
the
british
use
the
right
to
govern
us
like
a
baby
rattle
and
they
compared
with
america
is
but
a
stepping
stone
in
a
brook
there
s
scarcely
enough
of
it
out
of
water
to
keep
one
s
feet
dry
in
two
generations
our
population
will
exceed
that
of
the
british
isles
but
with
so
many
lying
agents
over
there
what
chance
have
they
to
learn
anything
about
us
they
will
expect
to
hear
you
tell
of
people
being
tomahawked
in
philadelphia
a
city
as
well
governed
as
any
in
england
they
can
not
understand
that
most
of
us
would
gladly
spend
nineteen
shillings
to
the
pound
for
the
right
to
spend
the
other
shilling
as
we
please
can
they
not
be
made
to
understand
us
jack
inquired
the
power
to
learn
is
like
your
hand
you
must
use
it
or
it
will
wither
and
die
there
are
brilliant
intellects
here
which
have
lost
the
capacity
to
learn
i
think
that
profound
knowledge
is
not
for
high
heads
i
wonder
just
what
you
mean
oh
the
moment
you
lose
humility
you
stop
learning
doors
to
every
intellect
one
lets
knowledge
in
the
other
lets
it
out
we
must
keep
both
doors
in
use
the
mind
is
like
a
purse
if
you
keep
paying
out
money
you
must
now
and
then
put
some
into
your
purse
or
it
will
be
empty
i
once
knew
a
man
who
was
a
liberal
spender
but
never
did
any
earning
we
soon
found
that
he
had
been
making
counterfeit
money
the
king
s
intellects
have
often
put
me
in
mind
of
him
they
are
flush
with
knowledge
but
they
never
learn
anything
they
can
tell
you
all
you
may
want
to
know
but
it
is
counterfeit
knowledge
how
about
lord
north
he
has
nailed
up
the
door
the
african
zebra
is
a
good
student
compared
to
him
it
is
a
maxim
of
walpole
and
north
that
all
men
are
equally
corrupt
it
is
a
hateful
notion
jack
exclaimed
but
not
without
some
warrant
you
may
be
sure
that
a
man
high
opinion
of
the
health
of
mankind
he
and
his
friends
are
so
engrossed
by
their
cards
and
cock
fights
and
horses
and
hounds
that
they
have
little
time
for
such
a
trivial
matter
as
the
problems
of
america
they
postpone
their
consideration
and
meanwhile
the
house
is
catching
fire
by
and
by
these
boys
are
going
to
get
burned
they
think
us
a
lot
of
semi
savages
not
to
be
taken
seriously
our
new
england
farmers
are
supposed
to
be
like
the
peasants
of
europe
the
fact
is
our
average
farmer
is
a
man
of
better
intellect
and
character
than
the
average
member
of
parliament
the
king
s
intellects
would
seem
to
be
out
of
order
said
jack
and
too
cynical
they
think
only
of
revenues
they
remind
me
of
the
report
of
the
reverend
commissary
blair
who
having
projected
a
college
in
virginia
came
to
england
to
ask
king
william
for
help
the
queen
in
the
king
s
absence
ordered
her
attorney
general
to
draw
a
charter
with
a
grant
of
two
that
they
were
in
a
war
and
needed
the
money
for
better
purposes
but
your
honor
virginia
is
in
great
need
of
ministers
said
the
commissary
it
has
souls
to
be
saved
souls
damn
your
souls
make
tobacco
said
the
queen
s
lawyer
the
counselors
of
royalty
have
no
high
opinion
of
souls
or
principles
think
of
these
taxes
on
exports
needed
by
neighbors
the
minds
that
invented
them
had
the
genius
of
a
pickpocket
i
see
that
you
are
not
in
love
with
england
sir
said
jack
my
boy
you
do
not
see
straight
the
doctor
answered
i
am
fond
of
england
at
heart
she
is
sound
the
king
is
a
kind
of
wooden
leg
he
has
no
feeling
and
no
connection
whatever
with
her
heart
and
little
with
her
intellect
the
people
are
out
of
sympathy
with
the
king
the
best
minds
in
england
are
directly
opposed
to
the
king
s
policy
are
helpless
he
has
throttled
the
voting
power
of
the
country
jack
i
have
told
you
all
this
and
shall
tell
you
more
because
well
you
know
plato
said
that
he
would
rather
be
a
blockhead
than
have
all
knowledge
and
nobody
to
share
it
you
ought
to
know
the
truth
but
i
have
told
you
only
for
your
own
information
i
am
going
to
write
letters
to
the
gazette
but
i
shall
not
quote
you
sir
without
permission
said
jack
at
this
point
the
attendant
entered
and
announced
that
mr
thomas
paine
had
called
to
get
his
manuscript
bring
him
up
said
the
doctor
in
a
moment
a
slim
dark
eyed
man
of
about
thirty
three
in
shabby
ill
fitting
garments
entered
the
room
doctor
franklin
shook
his
hand
and
gave
him
a
bundle
of
manuscript
and
said
it
is
well
done
but
i
think
it
unsound
i
would
not
publish
it
why
paine
asked
with
a
look
of
disappointment
well
it
the
wind
spits
in
his
own
face
it
would
be
a
dangerous
book
think
how
great
a
portion
of
mankind
are
weak
and
ignorant
men
and
women
think
how
many
are
young
and
inexperienced
and
incapable
of
serious
thought
they
need
religion
to
support
their
virtue
and
restrain
them
from
vice
if
men
are
so
wicked
with
religion
what
would
they
be
without
it
lay
the
manuscript
away
and
we
will
have
a
talk
about
it
later
i
should
like
to
talk
with
you
about
it
the
man
answered
with
a
smile
and
departed
the
bundle
under
his
arm
now
jack
said
franklin
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
can
give
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
i
must
go
and
to
the
girl
he
appeared
to
thunder
dire
happenings
if
she
did
not
obey
him
without
further
ado
he
picked
up
the
broken
fiddle
and
beckoned
the
sing
song
girl
rose
and
meekly
pattered
out
of
the
office
into
the
night
ruth
crossed
over
to
the
dramatist
of
this
tragicomedy
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
understand
she
said
her
faith
in
human
beings

to
do
something
that
was
fine

and

would
not
let
you
spurlock
turned
his
dull
eyes
and
tried
to
focus
hers
suddenly
he
burst
into
wild
laughter
but
equally
as
suddenly
something
strangled
the
sound
in
his
throat
he
out
of
the
chair
to
the
floor
where
he
lay
very
still
chapter
vii
the
astonishing
collapse
of
spurlock
created
a
tableau
of
short
duration
then
the
hotel
manager
struck
his
palms
together
sharply
and
two
chinese
boys
came
pattering
in
from
the
dining
room
with
a
gesture
which
was
without
any
kind
of
emotional
expression
the
manager
indicated
the
silent
crumpled
figure
on
the
floor
and
gave
the
room
number
the
chinamen
raised
the
limp
body
and
carried
it
to
the
hall
staircase
up
which
they
mounted
laboriously
a
doctor
at
once
cried
ruth
excitedly
a
doctor
what
he
needs
is
a
good
jolt
of
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
i
can
get
that
at
the
bar
the
manager
said
curtly
he
was
not
particularly
grateful
for
the
present
situation
i
warn
you
if
you
do
not
send
for
a
doctor
immediately
you
will
have
cause
to
regret
it
ruth
declared
vigorously
something
more
than
whisky
did
that
why
did
have
it
i
ca
nt
stand
at
the
elbow
of
any
of
the
guests
and
regulate
his
or
her
actions
so
long
as
a
man
behaves
himself
i
ca
nt
refuse
him
liquor
but
i
ll
call
a
doctor
since
you
order
it
you
ll
be
wasting
his
time
it
is
a
plain
case
of
alcoholic
stupor
i
ve
seen
many
cases
like
it
he
summoned
another
boy
and
rumbled
some
cantonese
immediately
the
boy
went
forth
with
his
paper
lantern
repeating
a
cry
as
he
ran
warning
to
clear
the
way
have
the
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
sent
to
mr
taber
s
room
at
once
ruth
ordered
i
will
administer
it
you
miss
enschede
frankly
astonished
that
one
stranger
should
offer
succour
to
another
there
is
nobody
else
someone
ought
to
be
with
him
until
the
doctor
arrives
he
may
die
the
manager
made
a
negative
sign
your
worry
is
needless
it
of
his
chair
it
was
his
heart
i
once
saw
a
man
die
after
collapsing
that
way
you
once
saw

that
way
the
manager
echoed
his
recent
puzzlement
returning

she
had
registered
that
address
but
there
was
something
so
mystifyingly
oriental
about
her
that
the
address
only
thickened
the
haze
behind
which
she
moved
where
that
can
wait
she
answered
please
hurry
the
ammonia
and
ruth
turned
away
abruptly
above
she
found
the
two
chinamen
squatted
at
the
side
of
the
door
they
rose
as
she
approached
she
hastened
past
she
immediately
took
the
pillows
from
under
the
head
of
the
man
who
had
two
names
released
the
collar
and
tie
and
arranged
the
arms
alongside
the
body
his
heart
was
beating
but
faintly
and
slowly
with
ominous
intermissions
all
alone
and
nobody
cared
whether
he
lived
or
died
she
was
now
permitted
freely
to
study
the
face
confusingly
new
mixed
with
reality
and
the
loose
artistic
conceptions
of
heroes
in
fiction
the
young
male
as
she
had
actually
seen
him
had
been
of
the
sailor
type
hard
bitten
primordial
ruthless
for
the
face
under
her
gaze
she
could
find
but
one
expression
fine
the
shape
of
the
head
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
brow
the
angle
of
the
nose
the
cut
of
the
chin
and
jaws
all
were
fine
of
a
type
she
had
never
before
looked
upon
closely
she
saw
now
that
it
was
not
a
dissipated
face
it
was
as
smooth
and
unlined
as
polished
marble
which
at
present
it
resembled
still
something
had
marked
the
face
something
had
left
an
indelible
touch
perhaps
the
sunken
cheeks
and
the
protruding
cheekbones
gave
her
this
impression
what
reassured
her
however
more
than
anything
else
was
the
shape
of
the
mouth
it
was
warmly
turned
the
confirmed

mouth

not
a

drunken
idea
ah
cum
had
called
it
and
yet
it
was
basically
a
fine
action
to
buy
the
freedom
of
a
poor
little
chinese
slave
girl
for
what
was
the
sing
song
girl
but
a
slave
the
double
slave
of
custom
and
of
men
ruth
wanted
to
know
keenly
what
had
impelled
the
idea
had
he
been
trying
to
stop
the
grim
descent
and
had
he
dimly
perceived
that
perhaps
a
fine
deed
would
serve
as
the
initial
barrier
a
drunken
idea
a
pearl
in
the
midst
of
a
rubbish
heap
that
terrible
laughter
just
before
his
senses
had
left
him
why
here
was
a
word
that
volleyed
at
her
from
all
directions
numbed
and
bewildered
her
the
multiple
echoes
of
her
own
first
utterance
of
the
word
why
was
nt
the
world
full
of
love
when
love
made
happiness
why
did
people
hide
their
natural
kindliness
as
if
it
were
something
shameful

when

why
did
this
young

have
one

on

another

why
was

been
trouble
enough
to
him
and
how
to
get
rid
of
that
redoubtable
youngster
had
been
a
question
so
mr
swiper
paused
not
to
make
an
issue
of
shelter
of
the
woods
and
in
the
fullness
of
time
to
the
more
secure
shelter
of
an
illinois
penitentiary
where
he
was
entered
under
the
name
of
chick
swiper
alias
chick
the
speeder
alias
chick
the
gent
alias
the
car
king
alias
jack
skidder
perhaps
because
he
was
so
slippery
in
his
official
pedigree
there
was
nothing
about
his
being
a
manual
training
teacher
though
he
must
have
had
some
knowledge
of
the
use
of
tools
for
he
removed
the
bars
from
his
cell
window
with
praiseworthy
skill
and
was
later
caught
in
michigan
i
think
so
there
sat
pee
wee
glaring
down
upon
peter
still
frightened
at
himself
for
the
stir
that
he
had
made
in
the
great
world

peter
removing

lantern
from

a
test
i

a
lot
of
adventures
to
night
i
was
with
in
my
life
you
lifted
that
pin
so
high
in
the
air
and
brought
it
down
on
jerry
s
arm
before
he
knew
what
you
were
going
to
do
i
never
saw
anything
so
funny
and
perry
rolled
over
on
the
rug
and
began
to
laugh
again
all
the
children
were
laughing
and
pretty
mrs
dunlap
had
tears
in
her
eyes
because
she
had
laughed
so
much
did
nt
hurt
you
sunny
boy
said
to
him
i
did
nt
mean
to
stick
a
pin
into
you
before
jerry
could
do
more
than
scowl
perry
sat
up
on
the
floor
wiping
his
eyes
what
i
want
to
know
he
said
is
jerry
a
donkey
and
then
he
began
to
laugh
again
and
this
time
the
children
shouted
with
him
they
thought
this
was
the
funniest
question
and
they
laughed
and
laughed
and
kept
saying
to
each
other
is
jerry
a
donkey
because
sunny
boy
pinned
the
donkey
s
tail
on
him
is
jerry
a
donkey

ll
show
you
whether

m
a
donkey
or
not
growled
jerry
frowning
at
them
all
i
ll
show
you
i
wo
nt
stay
at
your
old
party
and
he
dashed
upstairs
and
into
oliver
s
room
where
his
hat
and
coat
were
downstairs
he
came
flying
and
never
stopped
in
the
parlor
to
tell
mrs
dunlap
he
was
time
no
instead
jerry
opened
the
front
door
and
banged
it
after
him
with
a
crash
that
shook
the
house
he
s
gone
said
sunny
boy
dismayed
he

nt

mrs
dunlap

sunny
boy
i
m
afraid
we
teased
jerry
too
much
about
it
though
he
is
a
stranger
here
in
centronia
and
we
should
have
tried
to
be
extra
kind
to
him
you
should
nt
have
said
that
about
jerry
being
a
donkey
perry
she
added
turning
to
perry
phelps
you
must
have
hurt
his
feelings
miss
any
boy
in
her
school
he
did
not
laugh
now
but
he
came
up
to
mrs
dunlap
and
said
he
was
sorry
he
had
asked
his
cousin
if
he
were
a
donkey
i
should
think
he
could
take
a
joke
he
said
he
s
ten
years
old
but
i
m
sorry
mrs
dunlap
and
mother
will
be
too
that
jerry
left
your
party
like
this
and
i
hope
you
ll
scuse
him
banging
your
front
door
perry
phelps
mother
did
not
allow
him
to
bang
doors
if
he
forgot
and
slammed
one
he
had
to
come
back
and
open
and
close
it
softly
five
times
this
helped
him
to
remember
well
i
m
sorry
our
party
is
spoiled
for
jerry
sighed
mrs
dunlap
but
we
ll
go
out

very
nice

girls

had
the
nicest
time

the
baker

and
sunny
boy
went
a
different
way

could
walk
home
together
and
that
was
why
mrs
horton
had
said
that
harriet

as
they
were
passing
a
house
some
one

sunny
boy
replied
that
he
did
not
mind
and
nelson
and
ruth
went
into
the
house
while
he
trudged
off
down
the
street
by
himself
presently
he
chuckled
did
nt
jerry
look
funny
snickered
sunny
boy
i
wonder
what
made
me
pin
the
donkey
s
tail
on
him
where
do
you
think
you
re
going
so
fast
cried
jerry
stepping
out
from
behind
a
barrel
where
he
had
been
hiding
hello
said
sunny
boy
surprised
to
see
him
i
m
going
home
of
it
even
to
the
littlest
on
this
particular
afternoon
the
girls
found
allen
not
at
the
mines
as
they
supposed
they
would
but
at
the
ranch
house
busy
with
some
papers
when
they
besought
him
to
come
out
for
a
ride
he
hesitated
at
first
saying
that
he
ought
to
get
his
work
done
before
night
but
they
finally
persuaded
him
not
to
let
duty
interfere
with
pleasure
all
right
he
surrendered
at
last
if
you
will
get
one
of
the
boys
to
saddle
lightning
for
me
i
will
be
promise
and
in
a
short
time
was
listening
to
the
strangest
tale
he
had
ever
heard
as
he
listened
his
face
became
more
and
more
serious
but
girls
this
thing
sounds
impossible
he
burst
forth
finally
are
you
telling
me
that
you
alone
and
unprotected
managed
to
inveigle
this
murderer
into
confessing
his
crime
to
you
gee
it
s
it
s
unbelievable
the
four
of
you
would
be
a
great
help
to
me
in
my
profession
he
added
with
a
chuckle
i
did
nt
think
you
would
take
it
as
a
joke
said
betty
reproachfully
it
is
nt
a
joke
returned
allen
his
face
grave
again
it
s
a
mighty
serious
business
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
it
makes
me
sick
when
i
think
of
the
chance
you
took
he
was
speaking
to
all
the
girls
but
his
look
of
concern
was
for
betty
oh
we
do
nt
want
to
think
about
we
ve
done
a
good
deal
more
dangerous
things
than
that
in
our
lives
we
thought
we
hoped
you
might
help
us
to
prove
his
innocence
but
the
man
s
guilty
said
allen
surprised
we
have
that
by
his
own
confession
with
a
glance
of
despair
at
the
others
betty
interrupted
him
listen
to
me
allen
she
said
this
is
what
i
think
and
she
went
on
to
tell
him
her
idea
while
he
listened
at
first
with
a
smile
of
faint
amusement
on
his
lips
which
gradually
changed
to
grave
admiration
as
he
realized
betty
s
unfailing
faith
in
the
basic
goodness
of
human
nature
i
hope
you
are
right
little
girl
he
said
at
last
when
she
had
finished
and
was
looking
at
him
earnestly
i
d
like
to
believe
you
were
right
but
you
ca
nt
she
finished
for
him
trying
to
stifle
the
disappointment
in
her
heart
no
i
ca
nt
he
of
his
crime
that
he
flees
his
own
country
gives
up
money
and
fame
to
escape
the
law
you
may
be
pretty
sure
that
his
crime
was
a
real
one
but
allen
you
do
nt
know
the
man
betty
pleaded
pretty
close
to
tears
in
the
bitterness
of
her
disappointment
no
one
could
make
the
kind
of
music
he
does
and
be
truly
wicked
i
wish
you
could
have
met
him
i
think
you
would
have
tried
a
little
harder
to
help
him
i
m
willing
to
help
him
if
i
can
allen
answered
gently
feeling
that
he
would
be
almost
willing
to
step
into
this
poor
musician
s
place
if
he
might
have
betty
plead
for
him
as
she
had
just
done
for
the
other
what
is
it
you
would
like
me
to
do
then
suddenly
the
great
idea
popped
full
grown
into
betty
s
head
i
have
it
she
cried
why
not
write
to
paul
loup
s
manager
capital
replied
allen
approvingly
while
the
girls
looked
at
their
little
captain
admiringly
if
anybody
ought
to
be
able
to
give
us
information
he
surely
is
the
one
and
allen
begged
betty
reining
her
horse
close
to
allen
and
laying
a
timid
hand
on
his
arm
you
wo
nt
even
whisper
a
word
of
what
we
ve
told
you
not
for
your
foolish
old
law
or
anything
else
of
course
not
said
allen
smiling
at
her
we
have
to
give
the
poor
fellow
his
chance
chapter
xxiii
great
days
that
very
afternoon
allen
composed
a
letter
to
paul
loup
s
concert
manager
advised
and
censored
by
the
girls
of
course
and
they
all
rode
off
to
town
to
mail
it
in
time
to
catch
the
four
o
clock
outgoing
mail
now
said
mollie
as
this
duty
well
performed
they
started
back
to
the
ranch
i
feel
better
we
ve
started
something
anyway
let
grace
dubiously
they
did
not
expect
an
answer
to
this
epistle
within
ten
days
and
in
the
meantime
they
found
plenty
to
keep
them
busy
around
the
ranch
progress
at
the
mines
was
swift
and
almost
any
minute
now
they
might
expect
to
hear
the
glorious
tidings
that
some
one
had
struck
it
rich
nothing
had
been
seen
of
peter
levine
since
that
memorable
night
when
the
map
had
been
taken
from
him
and
it
was
rumored
that
the
rascally
lawyer
had
left
town
and
the
longer
he
keeps
away
the
healthier
it
will
be
for
him
i
reckon
allen
said
adding
with
a
laugh
gee
but
it
makes
me
happy
every
time
i
think
of
how
sore
that
chap
may
be
betty
had
dimpled
sympathetically
you
have
an
awfully
mean
disposition
allen
she
chided
him
meggy
and
dan
higgins
were
working
furiously
at
their
mine
but
after
a
few
days
betty
was
quick
to
see
that
they
were
not
progressing
as
well
as
unusually
strong
and
robust
for
her
age
was
only
a
girl
and
her
father
was
an
old
man
who
had
just
about
worn
out
his
energies
in
a
fruitless
search
for
fortune
betty
had
besought
her
father
to
send
help
to
these
good
friends
of
hers
and
mr
nelson
had
immediately
complied
there
had
been
some
trouble
with
dan
at
first
with
meggy

reminded

that

perhaps
the

wakes
up
gregg
harlan
had
watched
with
interest
the
boreland
s
preparation
for
departure
to
the
island
of
kon
klayu
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
doing
some
serious
thinking
and
ever
since
the
potlatch
he
had
been
seeing
himself
in
no
complimentary
light
his
chief
source
of
self
disgust
was
his
way
of
taking
the
information
that
the
borelands
including
jean
wiley
thought
him
a
squaw
man
again
to
those
few
moments
of
silent
companionship
when
he
had
stood
beside
the
girl
in
the
dusk
and
watched
the
funeral
canoes
come
in
why
had
nt
he
after
the
white
chief
told
him
of
his
reputed
connection
with
naleenah
why
had
nt
he
followed
jean
and
explained
true
the
shock
and
surprise
of
the
thing
had
momentarily
swept
him
off
his
feet
but
why
had
he
in
foolish
reckless
resentment
against
unjust
circumstances
rushed
off
instead
to
the
cabin
of
kayak
bill
and
taken
glass
after
glass
of
the
stuff
that
had
put
him
in
such
a
state
of
oblivion
that
he
was
unable
to
take
any
part
in
the
potlatch
festivities
since
then
he
had
been
too
ashamed
to
approach
either
of
the
white
women
he
felt
that
he
must
first
do
something
to
win
their
respect
during
his
twenty
five
years
harlan
had
been
a
drifter
along
the
pleasant
ways
of
least
resistance
this
was
perhaps
because
he
had
never
been
called
upon
to
shoulder
responsibility
six
months
before
in
love
he
had
found
himself
involved
in
a
foolish
but
unpleasant
financial
tangle
brought
about
by
a
plump
perfumed
pleasure
loving
little
blonde
this
small
person
from
an
eastern
state
had
made
his
former
knowledge
of
the
hectic
night
life
of
san
francisco
seem
but
a
tuning
up
of
the
orchestra
before
the
overture
after
the
inevitable
parting
of
the
ways
he
had
found
himself
obliged
to
call
upon
his
irate
and
disgusted
father
for
financial
assistance
he
had
done
this
often
before
so
often
that
this
last
episode
more
scarlet
than
any
of
the
others
brought
about
a
crisis
later
penniless
but
debtor
to
his
father
only
he
had
departed
under
a
cloud
of
paternal
disapproval
to
take
the
position
of
bookkeeper
at
faraway
katleean
it
was
then
that
he
decided
he
was
through
with
women
at
the
time
he
believed
it
as
all
men
do
who
make
a
similar
decision
but
up
here
in
the
north
he
found
that
a
white
woman
meant
more
to
men
than
in
the
states
to
stand
for
the
cleanness
and
the
decencies
of
life
he
found
himself
longing
to
be
near
and
speak
to
these
two
visiting
women
of
his
own
kind
he
had
heard
of
the
woman
hunger
of
alaska
and
recognized
in
himself
the
symptoms
of
that
state
which
causes
even
the
most
hardened
misogynist
to
travel
a
hundred
perilous
miles
merely
to
look
on
a
white
woman
s
face
and
hear
her
voice
and
music
the
music
of
jean
s
violin
drew
him
like
a
magnet
every
evening
when
she
played
on
the
afterdeck
of
the
hoonah
he
slipped
down
to
the
point
beyond
the
indian
village
and
listened
listened
hungrily
with
a
longing
to
join
her
and
explain
his
stupid
innocence
in
connection
with
the
dead
naleenah
his
youth
called
to
hers
and
he
wanted
this
clean
hearted
girl
to
think
well
of
him
his
drunkenness
but
of
course
there
was
no
excuse
for
that
he
despised
weakness
in
a
man
and
he
had
thought
a
good
deal
about
his
own
of
late
the
episode
of
naleenah
had
brought
him
face
to
when
he
looked
at
silvertip
lolling
brutish
and
drunken
on
the
blankets
of
his
bunk
harlan
had
wondered
what
alcohol
did
for
the
squaw
man
once
he
had
tried
to
outline
to
the
one
time
cook
of
the
sophie
sutherland
the
beauties
as
he
saw
them
of
getting
drunk
he
recalled
now
his
sensations
from
the
moment
the
alcohol
began
creeping
through
his
veins
softly
warmly
creating
a
glow
about
his
heart
vistas
then
opened
up
before
him
romance
and
adventure
beckoned
him
later
when
the
stimulant
reached
the
centers
of
his
brain
like
the
sentient
fingers
of
a
musician
touching
the
keyboard
of
his
soul
it
produced
golden
harmonies
from
those
keys
whose
tones
are
love
rhythm
color
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
inhibitions
melted
away
in
the
amber
light
that
enfolded
him
lovely
things
he
had
read
or
seen
or
thought
and
kept
to
himself
for
lack
of
expression
formed
themselves
into
words
of
exquisite
simplicity
that
were
to
his
ear
as
pastel
shades
to
the
eye
other
times
music
that
was
felt
rather
than
heard
swayed
him
and
his
feet
his
hands
his
whole
body
longed
to
dance
and
interpret
this
rhythm
of
the
universe
afterward
came
oblivion
a
sweet
forgetting
of
all
unpleasantness
a
divine
sense
of
mingling
without
responsibility
with
the
elements
but
lately
he
admitted
reluctantly
to
himself
even
in
his
moments
of
keenest
alcoholic
pleasure
he
had
been
aware
of
an
underthought
that
his
exalted
mood
must
pass
leaving
him
more
colorless
more
listless
the
creature
was
of
unusual
size
and
presented
a
broad
mark
as
it
chanced
the
steel
went
true
the
devil
fish
arose
to
the
surface
as
though
hurled
upward
by
a
submarine
explosion
one
of
its
great
battle
like
fins
broke
above
the
water
sending
gallons
of
spray
over
the
occupants
of
the
boat
and
splintering
the
harpoon
staff
against
the
boat
s
side
as
if
it
had
been
a
match
stem
then
its
ten
foot
pectoral
wing
struck
the
water
with
a
terrific
impact
making
a
noise
which
could
have
been
heard
several
miles
away
for
a
moment
the
monster
seemed
bewildered
and
that
moment
cost
it
dear
for
it
enabled
bob
to
throw
another
harpoon
which
stuck
deep
into
its
body
near
the
spine
with
a
mad
dash
it
started
off
to
sea
taking
the
harpoon
lines
with
it
as
the
lines
sped
out
of
their
barrels
mr
choate
grasped
one
and
mr
giddings
the
other
aided
respectively
by
john
and
tom
and
all
hands
strained
they
could
not
be
held
until
at
length
paul
and
bob
came
to
the
rescue
and
managed
to
get
the
ends
around
cleats
in
the
boat
however
this
did
not
stop
the
devil
fish
it
made
out
to
sea
with
remarkable
speed
for
so
clumsy
looking
a
monster
towing
the
heavy
boat
and
its
inmates
after
it
with
the
ease
of
a
horse
pulling
a
toy
carriage
as
it
went
all
hands
bore
on
the
lines
adding
to
its
burden
but
for
a
long
time
this
seemed
to
have
little
or
no
effect
every
once
in
a
while
the
devil
fish
would
literally
hurl
itself
several
feet
out
of
the
water
and
its
huge
flat
body
would
come
down
with
a
crack
like
the
explosion
of
a
gun
shell
perhaps
it
was
imagination
but
each
time
it
broke
the
surface
in
one
of
these
cavortings
it
seemed
to
the
boys
that
the
fish
was
bigger
than
the
last
time
now
and
then
the
creature
would
sound
for
deep
water
in
an
effort
to
shake
its
captors
off
choate
stood
ready
with
upraised
hatchet
to
cut
the
lines
at
the
last
moment
in
the
event
the
bow
should
show
signs
of
diving
under
all
of
a
sudden
the
lines
slackened
and
all
hands
frantically
hauled
in
slack
as
the
devil
fish
turned
and
dashed
toward
the
boat
he
came
up
almost
under
the
craft
one
great
wing
actually
lifting
one
side
of
the
heavy
launch
well
out
of
the
water
and
giving
everybody
a
pretty
stiff
scare
with
quick
presence
of
mind
mr
choate
at
this
moment
let
drive
another
harpoon
which
found
lodgment
in
the
monster
s
flat
head
and
away
it
dashed
again
with
the
greatest
vigor
as
there
was
now
a
line
leading
to
each
side
of
the
devil
fish
s
body
those
in
the
motor
boat
found
they
were
able
actually
to
drive
their
captive
as
if
it
were
a
runaway
horse
a
gradual
bearing
on
one
rein
or
the
other
tending
to
direct
the
uncertain
creature
in
that
direction
thus
very
adroitly
they
swerved
the
huge
fish
toward
the
now
distant
shallower
waters
of
the
isle
by
this
time
the
monster
had
carried
them
out
fully
ten
miles
it
had
not
forgotten
its
old
tactics
of
deep
diving
either
and
there
were
numerous
occasions
when
after
one
of
these
submersions
it
came
up
and
started
fiercely
toward
the
boat
and
it
took
the
most
skillful
maneuvering
on
the
part
of
the
steersman
as
well
as
wicked
use
of
oars
on
the
part
of
those
in
the
craft
to
drive
the
creature
off
and
keep
from
being
upset
they
let
their
anchor
drag
and
at
times
reversed
the
propeller
hauling
on
this
side
and
that
on
the
harpoon
lines
when
the
devil
fish
would
not
be
going
to
suit
them
in
this
fashion
it
was
slowly
but
surely
tired
out
they
began
to
reel
in
slack
line
and
finally
the
immense
fish
was
wallowing
within
twenty
feet
of
the
boat
surrounded
by
hungry
sharks
which
had
been
attracted
by
its
blood
it
would
never
do
to
goad
it
now
by
hauling
in
on
the
lines
as
it
the
waiting
sharks
could
then
make
a
meal
of
its
luckless
inmates
so
mr
choate
told
the
boys
to
use
their
automatic
revolvers
and
see
if
they
could
not
dispatch
the
devil
fish
at
once
this
was
done
john
tom
paul
and
bob
all
firing
several
shots
each
which
put
the
monster
in
such
a
helpless
state
that
they
could
handle
it
with
less
danger
to
themselves
until
that
moment
not
one
of
them
realized
that
nearly
five
hours
had
elapsed
since
they
first
attacked
this
jumbo
of
the
sea
so
busy
had
they
been
every
moment
of
the
time
in
trying
to
conquer
the
creature
and
everybody
was
quite
exhausted
now
that
the
excitement
was
over
although
this
fish
had
three
harpoons
in
his
body
and
a
dozen
shots
in
its
head
and
heart
it
was
by
no
means
dead
and
the
fishermen
found
considerable
difficulty
in
towing
it
into
the
harbor
some
miles
away
the
natives
of
bimini
were
greatly
interested
in
the
capture
and
our
friends
were
able
to
get
fifteen
of
could
get
a
good
look
at
it
they
were
amazed
at
the
unusual
size
of
the
devil
fish
and
mr
choate
declared
again
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
large
one
of
its
kind
it
measured
twenty
two
feet
across
and
must
have
weighed
close
to
pounds
some
people
call
the
octopus
a
devil
fish
said
mr
choate
this
is
all
wrong
they
are
both
large
and
vicious
creatures
but
entirely
different
in
looks
the
devil
fish
belongs
to
the
ray
family
and
as
you
see
is
a
huge
bat
like
creature
which
uses
its
body
fins
with
a
waving
undulating
motion
and
propels
itself
through
the
water
at
remarkable
speed
it
is
built
on
the
principle
of
our
airplane
in
looks
said
tom
with
a
will
be
swift
he
said
the
way
the
courage
wo
nt
be
oozing
out
of
me
yes
michael
daragh
she
stood
up
straight
and
proud
before
him
waiting
for
his
word
back
alike
on
prosperous
opulent
love
and
busy
and
purposeful
spinsterhood
knowing
that
happiness
for
her
was
the
grave
young
saint
whose
chief
concern
would
be
always
for
the
world
s
woe
richly
dowered
though
she
was
in
body
and
brain
fit
for
a
man
s
whole
devotion
she
would
be
content
to
share
him
with
the
submerged
with
the
besmirched
and
befouled
of
the
earth
and
at
last
he
was
speaking
many
s
the
bold
boon
i
ve
begged
but
never
the
like
of
this
he
said
his
gray
eyes
holding
hers
but
never
the
like
of
this
would
you
could
you
be
dining
with
a
dope
fiend
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
jane
before
she
worked
her
hands
free
of
his
clasp
and
heard
her
voice
i
do
nt
believe
i
understand
why
would
you
indeed
he
cried
penitently
let
you
sit
down
till
i
m
telling
you
she
seated
herself
in
her
straight
desk
chair
and
dining
it
sounds
rather
like
a
line
from
a
comic
song
does
nt
it
a
lad
he
is
just
said
daragh
earnestly
it
got
hold
of
him
after
a
sickness
in
the
smooth
devil
s
way
it
has
six
months
now
i
m
toiling
with
him
times
i
have
him
on
his
feet
times
he
s
destroyed
again
t
was
a
terrible
pity
i
had
to
be
leaving
him
the
while
i
was
home
in
ireland
well
i
found
him
doing
rare
and
fine
god
love
him
back
at
his
drawing
again
in
the
scrap
of
a
studio
i
found
for
him
but
a
pitiful
tangle
of
nerves
and
fancies
what
he
needs
now
is
a
friend
his
own
sort
some
one
that
speaks
his
own
tongue
he
thinks
the
decent
world
will
have
none
of
him
a
weak
pitiful
thing
is
nt
worth
the
saving
fair
perished
with
the
lonesomeness
he
is
i
used
to
know
women
he
was
i
miss
them
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
the
look
of
their
white
hands
and
their
making
tea
and
the
light
gay
talk
we
d
be
having
then
he
sat
limp
with
the
grit
gone
out
of
him
not
one
of
them
would
come
near
me
now
he
said
holding
their
skirts
away
from
me
passing
by
on
the
other
side
and
then
may
the
devil
fly
away
with
my
tongue
jane
vail
i
heard
myself
saying
there
s
one
wo
nt
be
doing
that
lad
there
s
one
the
best
and
fairest
and
cleverest
of
them
all
the
wonder
worker
of
the
world
i
said
will
be
putting
on
her
gayest
gear
and
be
coming
here
to
make
tea
talk
with
you
the
way
you
ll
think
the
month
of
june
itself
is
happened
in
your
studio
he
stopped
looking
down
at
her
with
anxious
eyes
jane
took
her
own
time
about
looking
at
him
and
when
she
did
it
he
was
still
wearing
his
winter
suit
this
soft
spring
weather
and
it
wanted
pressing
and
his
boots
were
far
from
new
he
stooped
a
little
as
he
stood
there
waiting
for
her
verdict
as
if
even
the
broadest
shoulders
wearied
finally
of
other
people
s
loads
and
the
line
of
his
zealot
s
jaw
was
sharper
than
ever
she
felt
nothing
but
scorn
for
him
he
had
birth
breeding
abilities
why
must
he
wrap
himself
in
monkish
sackcloth
in
monkish
celibacy
rage
rose
in
her
rage
and
ridicule
for
herself
so
this
was
the
man
for
whom
she
had
dressed
herself
three
times
cunningly
and
provocatively
this
was
the
man
to
whom
she
had
come
running
with
her
heart
held
out
in
her
hands
her
sane
sound
hitherto
unassailable
heart
twenty
eight
years
old
when
he
required
of
her
merely
a
service
such
as
he
might
ask
of
any
of
his
settlement
workers
money
from
this
one
work
from
that
one
charm
and
cheer
eyes
i
m
doubting
i
had
the
right
to
ask
you
is
it
too
much
indeed
jane
rose
lifting
her
shoulders
ever
so
slightly
the
right
why
surely
you
re
asking
me
for
an
hour
or
so
of
my
time
just
as
you
would
ask
me
for
a
check
i
am
to
lift
up
the
light
of
my
countenance
on
this
young
gentleman
then
and
convince
him
that
he
is
still
socially
desirable
i
ll
be
praising
you
all
the
long
days
of
my
life
if
you
will
he
said
humbly
continuing
to
stand
sit
down
then
while
i
put
on
my
hat
she
said
carelessly
quite
as
she
would
have
spoken
to
a
messenger
and
moved
toward
her
bedroom
door
please
he
took
one
step
after
her
it
s
riot
but
your
little
brown
gown
would
charm
the
birds
off
the
bush
and
it
s
not
that
i
d
be
mentioning
it
or
asking
it
for
and
her
voice
was
as
bright
and
dry
as
her
eyes
one
could
hardly
fancy
you
asking
anything
for
yourself
i
would
not
indeed
he
said
grateful
for
the
exoneration
but
i
m
wondering
would
nt
you
seem
grander
to
the
lad
in
a
a
gayer
frock
perhaps
very
possibly
i
would
said
jane
reasonably
but
i
shall
have
to
keep
you
waiting
a
little
longer
then
she
went
into
the
other
room
and
shut
the
door
slowly
and
softly
to
demonstrate
the
perfect
control
of
her
nerves
and
proceeded
to
make
her
fourth
toilet
for
the
hour
she
took
her
time
and
did
her
best
which
was
very
good
indeed
when
she
put
her
mind
to
it
and
she
hummed
a
snatch
of
song
all
the
while
just
loud
enough
to
carry
to
the
study
but
every
time
she
met
her
shamed
and
furious
eyes
in
the
glass
her
face
crisped
into
hotter
flame
and
she
stopped
singing
she
kept
acquitted
her
of
having
the
mountains
and
knowing
he
is
lost
is
panic
stricken
the
trail
of
course
he
looked
for
it
and
there
was
no
trail
to
his
town
wise
eyes
he
ran
hither
and
thither
and
back
to
hither
again
he
went
forward
seemingly
and
found
himself
back
whence
he
started
he
looked
for
cairns
for
tree
blazes
for
any
one
of
the
signs
of
which
he
had
learned
in
the
last
three
weeks
he
terror
seized
him
terror
of
those
grim
menacing
towering
mountain
masses
he
ran
round
and
round
and
round
darted
backward
and
forward
called
stumbled
fell
and
subsided
beaten
he
had
a
tiny
box
of
matches
with
him
but
little
else
he
had
found
the
trail
difficult
enough
without
being
pack
burdened
food
he
bethought
himself
of
a
little
blue
tin
box
in
his
coat
pocket
he
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
its
very
name
struck
terror
to
his
heart
u
s
emergency
ration
it
was
printed
on
the
box
just
below
that
he
made
out
powdered
sugar
chocolate
cocoa
butter
malted
milk
egg
albumin
casein
not
to
be
opened
except
on
command
of
officer
my
god
he
had
come
to
this
he
looked
at
it
wide
eyed
he
was
very
hungry
the
ration
in
its
blue
tin
like
a
box
of
shaving
talcum
had
been
handed
to
each
of
the
party
in
a
chorus
of
shouting
and
laughter
and
to
pry
open
the
box
and
ate
some
of
its
contents
slowly
it
was
not
agreeable
dusk
was
coming
on
there
were
mountain
lions
he
knew
that
those
rocks
and
crevices
were
peopled
with
all
sorts
of
stealthy
snarling
slinking
four
footed
creatures
he
would
build
a
fire
they
were
afraid
of
the
flames
he
had
read
somewhere
and
would
not
come
near
perhaps
the
others
would
see
the
light
and
come
back
to
find
him
curse
them
why
had
nt
they
come
before
now
it
was
dusk
by
the
time
he
had
his
fire
built
he
had
crouched
over
it
for
a
half
hour
blowing
it
coaxing
it
wheedling
it
there
were
few
twigs
or
sticks
at
this
height
he
was
very
cold
his
heavy
sweater
was
in
the
pack
on
the
horse
s
back
finally
he
was
rewarded
with
a
feeble
flicker
a
tiny
tongue
of
flame
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
with
a
gesture
transfixed
for
on
the
plateau
above
him
rose
a
great
shaft
of
fire
the
kind
of
fire
that
only
pete
the
most
expert
among
guides
could
build
and
as
he
stared
there
burst
out
at
him
from
behind
trees
rocks
crevices
a
whole
horde
of
imps
shrieking
with
fiendish
laughter
ho
ho
laughed
jessie
and
ha
ha
howled
the
harvard
hellions
thought
you
were
lost
didntcha
gosh
you
looked
funny
your
face
florian
stared
at
them
he
did
not
smile
he
went
quietly
over
to
his
tiny
camp
fire
and
stamped
it
out
neatly
as
he
had
been
taught
to
do
he
took
his
can
of
emergency
ration
not
to
be
opened
except
on
command
of
officer
and
hurled
it
far
far
down
the
mountainside
jessie
heath
laughed
contemptuously
and
florian
looking
at
her
did
nt
care
did
nt
care
did
nt
care
the
for
florian
the
rest
were
to
do
another
four
weeks
of
it
farther
into
the
interior
florian
sickened
at
the
thought
of
it
when
he
bade
them
farewell
he
was
so
glad
to
be
free
of
them
that
he
almost
loved
them
when
he
found
himself
actually
on
the
little
jerkwater
train
that
was
to
connect
him
with
the
main
line
he
patted
the
dusty
red
plush
seat
gratefully
as
one
would
stroke
a
faithful
beast
when
he
came
into
the
grand
central
station
he
would
have
stooped
and
kissed
the
steps
of
the
marble
staircase
if
his
porter
had
not
been
on
the
point
of
vanishing
with
his
bags
that
night
on
reaching
home
he
stayed
in
the
bathtub
for
an
hour
just
lying
there
in
the
warm
soothing
liquid
only
moving
to
dapple
his
fingers
now
and
then
as
a
lazy
fish
moves
a
languid
fin
god
s
country
this
was
it
my
it
s
nice
to
have
you
back
again
mr
sykes
said
mrs
pet
said
florian
cryptically
mrs
pet
stared
a
little
wonderingly
yes
that
s
vacant
since
the
ostranders
left
in
july
why
do
you
ask
mr
sykes
nothing
florian
answered
airily
not
a
thing
just
asked
his
train
had
come
in
at
nine
it
was
eleven
now
but
he
was
restless
and
a
little
hungry
and
very
much
exhilarated
you
certainly
look
grand
mrs
pet
had
exclaimed
admiringly
and
my
how
you
re
sunburned
he
left
the
lexington
avenue
house
now
and
strolled
over
to
the
near
by
white
tiled
restaurant
there
in
the
window
was
the
white
capped
one
flapping
pancakes
florian
could
have
kissed
him
he
sat
down
a
waitress
approached
him
i
do
nt
know
mused
florian
i
m
sort
of
hungry
but
i
do
nt
just
the
pork
and
beans
are
elegant
to
night
suggested
the
girl
thundered
florian
the
girl
drew
herself
up
icily
i
ai
nt
deef
you
do
nt
need
to
yell
florian
looked
up
at
her
contritely
and
smiled
his
winning
smile
i
m
sorry
i
did
nt
mean
i
i
never
want
to
see
beans
again
as
long
as
i
live
he
was
down
at
the
store
early
early
next
morning
his
practised
eye
swept
the
department
for
possible
slackness
for
changes
for
needed
adjustments
the
two
maine
ex
guides
and
the
chap
who
knew
the
rockies
like
the
palm
of
his
hand
welcomed
him
with
judas
like
slaps
on
the
shoulder
like
it
they
asked
him
and
god
s
country
the
west
he
answered
mechanically
after
that
he
ignored
them
at
nine
he
ran
down
the
two
flights
of
stairs
to
the
third
floor
he
did
not
wait
for
the
elevator
for
a
moment
he
could
not
find
her
and
his
heart
him
go
back
to
palestine
or
to
the
country
that
oppressed
him
i
say
i
ve
got
the
same
amount
of
patience
with
these
hyphenated
americans
as
i
have
with
the
jews
who
try
to
segregate
themselves
and
dot
the
map
with
new
jerusalems
where
s
the
sense
in
throwing
yourself
into
the
melting
pot
glad
of
the
chance
and
then
kicking
bed
dear
you
are
as
pale
as
a
ghost
and
i
m
so
tired
i
ca
nt
see
straight
our
baby
is
all
right
do
nt
you
worry
snow
falls
on
the
just
and
the
unjust
there
was
quite
as
much
of
it
in
hannah
s
back
yard
as
in
either
virginia
s
or
nellie
s
perhaps
even
a
little
more
had
drifted
into
the
fence
corners
hannah
s
joy
in
discovering
that
in
this
respect
she
had
not
been
slighted
crowded
her
troubles
into
the
background
immediately
after
breakfast
bundled
up
snugly
she
stood
in
her
yard
and
threw
snowballs
toward
her
neighbors
homes
while
she
squealed
with
delight
in
a
very
few
minutes
three
little
girls
were
playing
where
only
one
had
played
before
the
two
newcomers
virginia
lawrence
and
nellie
halloran
presented
an
interesting
contrast
virginia
slim
and
tall
for
her
age
with
long
flat
yellow
braids
handled
the
snow
daintily
even
gingerly
nellie
fat
and
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
snow
and
then
shook
herself
like
a
puppy
until
the
advent
of
hannah
a
subtle
antagonism
had
existed
between
the
two
children
virginia
s
favorite
game
was
playing
lady
with
a
train
floating
gracefully
behind
her
nellie
s
chief
joy
in
life
was
seeing
how
long
she
could
stand
on
her
head
her
short
skirts
obeying
the
laws
of
gravity
all
the
while
hannah
however
vibrated
obligingly
between
the
two
sports
and
kept
the
peace
inviolate
romping
in
the
snow
is
hard
play
and
presently
the
little
girls
sat
panting
on
the
top
step
of
the
josephs
back
porch
immediately
nellie
produced
a
string
of
amethyst
colored
beads
from
her
coat
pocket
with
the
announcement
that
she
would
say
her
prayers
while
resting
what
kind
of
beads
are
those
asked
hannah
rosary
beads
course
responded
nellie
hannah
you
do
nt
know
anything
i
do
too
huh
god
until
i
told
you
i
reckon
i
thought
god
was
an
orphan
hannah
pleaded
in
extenuation
but
what
about
god
s
papa
she
demanded
with
sudden
inspiration
you
re
so
smarty
tell
me
about
that
oh
god
did
nt
have
to
have
a
father
nellie
answered
easily
everything
is
free
in
heaven
so
he
did
nt
have
to
have
a
father
to
work
for
him
when
he
was
little
then
why
did
he
have
to
have
a
mama
to
tell
him
what
to
do
course
you
know
how
t
is
if
you
ask
your
papa
anything
do
nt
he
always
say
go
ask
your
mama
hannah
had
noticed
this
shifting
of
masculine
responsibility
more
than
once
that
s
so
she
acquiesced
then
a
terrible
thought
struck
her
i
do
nt
want
to
go
to
heaven
i
do
nt
want
to
go
anywhere
unless
irish
wits
were
ready
i
just
said
god
did
nt
need
any
papa
course
our
papas
will
go
to
heaven
cause
that
s
the
only
place
they
can
quit
working
did
nt
i
hear
my
papa
say
one
time
he
hoped
he
d
get
a
little
rest
in
heaven
cause
he
never
got
any
on
this
earth
but
you
have
to
die
before
you
can
get
to
heaven
sighed
hannah
virginia
who
had
been
maintaining
a
most
dignified
silence
looked
as
if
she
must
speak
or
explode
no
you
do
nt
heaven
begins
here
and
now
she
recited
if
you
are
good
you
are
well
and
happy
and
that
s
heaven
tis
nt
scoffed
nellie
do
you
see
any
angels
flying
round
in
this
here
yard
i
do
nt
hannah
rather
took
to
virginia
s
argument
and
resolved
to
have
conversation
with
her
some
time
undampened
by
nellie
s
skepticism
heaven
here
and
now
hannah
had
every
intention
of
being
at
the
banquet
table
at
the
present
moment
however
the
rosary
beads
were
of
fascinating
interest
she
must
hold
them
in
her
own
hands
and
watch
the
play
of
purple
lights
upon
the
snow
as
she
flashed
them
in
the
sun
questions
about
the
crucifix
she
found
brought
on
an
embarrassing
silence
nellie
looked
at
virginia
virginia
looked
at
nellie
then
the
two
excused
themselves
for
a
whispered
colloquy
at
the
other
end
of
the
yard
when
they
returned
virginia
acted
as
spokesman
fixing
nellie
with
an
unrelenting
eye
that
is
jesus
nailed
to
the
cross
hannah
some
very
wicked
people
did
it
there
was
nothing
exciting
in
this
to
hannah
wicked
people
were
doing
wicked
things
the
world
over
all
the
time
the
statement
fell
flat
and
nellie
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
dramatic
effect
broke
treaty
i
spect
the
jews
did
it
she
said
they
the
jews
are
nice
people
they
would
nt
do
a
wicked
thing
like
that
virginia
put
an
arm
across
hannah
s
shoulders
now
see
what
you
ve
done
she
snapped
at
nellie
oh
i
spect
the
irish
helped
them
nellie
added
magnanimously
my
papa
says
the
irish
are
into
every
thing
not
having
to
bear
the
ignominy
alone
hannah
was
comforted
what
makes
you
say
prayers
on
the
beads
she
asked
cause

want
santy

bring
me

dozen
times

hannah
s
face
fell
all
her
sorrows
returned
with
a
rush
have
you
got
any
more
of
those
beads
she
asked
yes
but
they
would
nt
do
you
any
good

answered

understanding

the

was
sewed

it
came
to

and

big
pete
spent
a
long
time
in
solemn
thought
before
he
was
ready
looked
up
with
a
broad
smile
and
cried

insisted
upon
having
my
ragged
but
stylish
knickerbockers
to
use
as
a
pattern
chapter
x
big
pete
was
an
expert
backwoods
tailor
shoemaker
and
shirtmaker
but
these
were
but
few
of
his
accomplishments
not
his
trade
he
was
first
last
and
aways
a
hunter
and
scout
no
matter
what
occupation
seemed
to
engage
his
attention
for
the
time
it
never
interfered
with
his
ability
to
hear
see
or
smell
it
was
while
i
was
going
around
camp
minus
my
lower
garments
that
i
saw
pete
suddenly
throw
up
his
head
and
suspiciously
sniff
the
air
at
the
same
time
sharply
scanning
the
windward
side
of
our
camp
with
his
actions
and
quick
to
detect
anything
unusual
and
i
now
knew
that
something
of
interest
had
happened
to
the
windward
and
close
by
us
was
a
mound
thickly
covered
with
bullberry
bushes
and
underbrush
and
so
far
as
could
be
seen
there
was
nothing
suspicious
in
the
appearance
of
the
thicket
fixing
my
eyes
on
big
pete
i
saw
a
peculiar
expression
spread
over
his
face
which
seemed
to
be
half
of
mirth
and
half
of
wonderment
and
i
immediately
knew
that
his
wonderful
nose
had
warned
him
of
the
presence
of
something
to
the
windward
slowly
and
quietly
he
laid
aside
my
almost
finished
breeches
and
silently
stole
away
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
before
he
returned
with
a
very
solemn
face
doggone

corn
shucked

had

visitor
but
it

away

here
my
new
elk
hide
knickerbockers
with
cuffs
of
dressed
buckskin
laced
around
my
calves
and
my
beautiful
soft
buckskin
shirt
tucked
in
at
the
waist
i
began
to
feel
like
a
real
nimrod
but
after
i
added
my
moo
loch
capo
the
shooting
jacket
with
elk
teeth
buttons
pulled
a
pair
of
shank
moccasins
over
my
feet
and
donned
a
cap
made
of
lynx
skin
i
was
as
happy
as
a
child
with
its
christmas
stocking
it
was
a
really
wonderful
suit
of
clothing
the
hair
of
the
elk
hide
was
on
the
outside
and
not
only
made
the
coat
and
breeches
warmer
but
helped
to
shed
the
rain
the
buttons
of
the
elk
teeth
were
fastened
on
with
thongs
run
through
holes
in
their
centers
and
my
coat
could
be
laced
up
after
the
fashion
of
a
military
overcoat
the
elk
s
teeth
served
as
frogs
and
loops
of
rawhide
answered
for
the
braid
that
is
used
on
military
coats
my
shank
moccasins
were
made
by
first
making
a
cut
around
each
of
the
hind
legs
of
an
elk
enough
for
boot
legs
and
making
another
cut
far
enough
below
the
heels
to
make
room
for
one
s
feet
the
fresh
skins
when
peeled
off
looked
like
rude
stockings
with
holes
at
the
toes
the
skins
were
turned
wrong
side
out
and
the
open
toes
closed
by
bringing
the
lower
part
or
sole
up
over
the
opening
and
sewing
it
there
after
the
manner
of
a
tip
to
the
modern
shoe
when
this
novel
foot
gear
was
dry
enough
for
the
purpose
big
pete
ornamented
the
legs
with
quaint
colored
designs
made
with
split
porcupine
quills
colored
with
dyes
which
pete
himself
had
manufactured
of
roots
and
barks
dressed
in
my
unique
and
picturesque
costume
i
stood
upright
while
pete
surveyed
me
with
the
pride
and
satisfaction
of
one
who
had
done
a
fine
piece
of
work
i
had
now
little
fear
of
being
called
a
tenderfoot
and
when
i
viewed
my
reflection
in
the
spring
i
felt
quite
proud
of
my
appearance
come
along
now
old
scout
said
pete
viewing
me
with
the
pride
of
an
artist
a
real
trail
i
want
to
see
what
my
teaching
has
done
for
you
pete
led
me
through
the
underbrush
to
a
point
among
the
rocks
tha
a
trail
begins
right
under
yore
nose
let
s
see
what
you
make
of
it
he
said
crisply
down
on
all
fours
i
crept
over
the
ground
and
to
my
surprise
and
joy
i
found
that
i
could
here
and
there
detect
a
turned
leaf
the
twist
of
which
indicated
the
direction
taken
by
the
party
who
made
the
trail
i
noticed
that
the
bits
of
wood
pine
cones
and
sticks
scattered
around
were
darker
on
the
parts
next
to
the
ground
and
it
only
required
simple
reasoning
for
me
to
conclude
that
when
the
dark
side
was
uppermost
the
object
had
been
recently
disturbed
and
rolled
over
it
was
a
day
of
great
discoveries
i
found
that
what
is
true
of
the
sticks
is
equally
true
of
the
pebbles
and
a
displaced
fragment
of
stone
immediately
caught
my
eyes
with
the
tenacity
of
a
myself
at
the
base
of
the
park
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
diagonal
fracture
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
where
i
had
climbed
when
i
discovered
the
golden
trout
as
i
have
said
the
fracture
led
diagonally
up
the
towering
face
of
the
beetling
precipice
for
fear
that
i
might
have
made
some
mistake

a
a
that
afternoon
young
darragh
located
sard
s
office
and
presented
himself
as
a
customer
the
weasel
faced
clerk
behind
the
wicket
laid
a
pistol
handy
and
informed
darragh
that
sard
was
away
on
a
business
trip
darragh
looked
cautiously
around
the
small
office
can
anybody
hear
us
nobody
why
i
have
important
news
concerning
jose
quintana
whispered
darragh
where
is
sard
why
he
had
a
letter
from
quintana
this
very
morning
replied
mr
sard
left
for
albany
on
the
one
o
clock
train
is
there
any
trouble
plenty
replied
darragh
coolly
do
you
know
quintana
no
but
mr
sard
expects
him
here
any
day
now
darragh
leaned
closer
against
the
grille
listen
very
carefully
if
a
man
comes
here
who
calls
himself
jose
quintana
turn
him
over
to
the
police
until
mr
sard
returns
no
matter
what
he
tells
you
turn
him
over
to
the
police
do
you
understand
who
are
you
demanded
the
worried
clerk
are
you
one
of
quintana
s
people
young
man
said
darragh
i
m
close
enough
to
quintana
to
give
you
orders
and
give
sard
orders
and
quintana
too
a
great
light
dawned
on
the
scared
clerk
you
are
jose
quintana
he
said
hoarsely
darragh
bored
him
through
with
his
dark
stare
mind
your
business
he
said
up
sard
s
trail
it
led
to
a
dealer
in
automobiles
sard
had
bought
a
comet
six
paying
cash
and
had
started
north
through
schenectady
fonda
and
mayfield
the
following
day
darragh
traced
a
brand
new
comet
six
containing
one
short
dark
levantine
with
a
parrot
nose
in
northville
darragh
hired
a
ford
at
lake
pleasant
sard
s
car
went
wrong
darragh
missed
him
by
ten
minutes
but
he
learned
that
sard
had
inquired
the
way
to
ghost
lake
inn
that
was
sufficient
darragh
bought
an
axe
drove
as
far
as
harrod
s
corners
dismissed
the
ford
and
walked
into
a
forest
entirely
familiar
to
him
he
emerged
in
half
an
hour
on
a
wood
road
two
miles
farther
on
here
he
felled
a
tree
across
the
road
and
sat
down
in
the
bushes
to
await
events
toward
sunset
hearing
a
car
coming
he
tied
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
below
the
eyes
and
took
an
automatic
from
his
pocket
sard
s
car
stopped
and
out
of
the
bushes
poked
his
pistol
against
mr
sard
s
fat
abdomen
and
leisurely
and
thoroughly
robbed
him
in
an
agreeable
spot
near
a
brook
darragh
lighted
his
pipe
and
sat
him
down
to
examine
the
booty
in
detail
two
pistols
a
stiletto
and
a
blackjack
composed
the
arsenal
of
mr
sard
a
large
wallet
disclosed
more
than
four
thousand
dollars
in
treasury
notes
something
to
reimburse
ricca
when
she
arrived
he
thought
among
sard
s
papers
he
discovered
a
cipher
letter
from
rotterdam
probably
from
quintana
cipher
was
rather
in
darragh
s
line
all
ciphers
are
solved
by
similar
methods
unless
the
key
is
contained
in
a
code
book
known
only
to
sender
and
receiver
but
quintana
s
cipher
proved
to
be
only
an
easy
acrostic
i
see
excellent
possibility
in
you
perform
the
duties
punctually
in
this
very
lowly
office
and
high
ranks
of
service
in
the
church
militant
will
be
open
he
put
on
a
very
fine
shovel
hat
and
led
the
way
to
his
large
touring
car
it
was
a
very
uncomfortable
ride
for
gissing
a
silk
hat
is
the
least
stable
apparel
for
swift
motoring
and
the
chauffeur
drove
at
high
speed
the
bishop
leaning
back
in
the
gazed
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
at
the
countryside
and
talked
gaily
about
his
days
as
a
young
curate
gissing
sat
holding
his
hat
on
he
saw
only
too
well
that
by
the
humiliating
oddity
of
chance
they
were
going
to
take
the
road
that
led
exactly
past
his
own
house
he
could
only
hope
that
mrs
spaniel
and
the
various
children
would
not
be
visible
for
explanations
would
be
too
complicated
desperately
he
praised
the
view
to
be
obtained
on
another
road
but
bishop
borzoi
was
too
interested
in
his
own
topic
to
pay
much
attention
by
the
way
said
the
latter
as
they
drew
near
the
familiar
region
i
must
introduce
you
to
miss
airedale
she
lives
in
the
big
place
on
the
hill
over
there
her
family
always
used
to
attend
what
i
will
now
call
your
chapel
she
is
a
very
ardent
churchgoer
and
it
was
a
sincere
grief
to
her
when
the
place
had
to
be
closed
you
will
find
her
a
great
aid
what
one
does
not
always
find
in
the
devouter
members
of
her
sex
young
and
beautiful
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
you
are
a
bachelor
they
were
approaching
the
last
turning
at
which
it
was
still
possible
to
avoid
the
fatal
road
and
gissing
s
attention
was
divided
yes
after
a
fashion
he
replied
bishop
do
you
know
that
road
down
into
the
valley
the
view
is
really
superb
yes
that
road
oh
no
i
am
a
bachelor
it
was
too
late
the
chauffeur
unconscious
of
this
private
crisis
was
spinning
along
the
homeward
way
with
a
tender
emotion
gissing
saw
the
spires
of
the
poplar
trees
the
hemlocks
down
beyond
the
pond
the
fringe
of
woods
that
concealed
the
house
until
you
were
quite
upon
it
the
car
swerved
suddenly
and
the
driver
only
saved
it
by
a
quick
and
canny
manoeuvre
from
going
down
the
bank
he
came
to
a
stop
and
almost
from
underneath
the
rear
been
playing
in
the
road
there
they
were
bunks
groups
and
yelpers
inordinately
grown
and
two
of
the
spaniels
their
clothes
were
deplorable
their
faces
grimed
their
legs
covered
with
burrs
their
whole
demeanour
was
ragamuffin
and
wild
yet
gissing
felt
a
pang
of
pride
to
see
his
godchildren
s
keen
independent
bearing
contrasted
with
the
rowdier
disreputable
look
of
the
young
spaniels
quickly
he
averted
his
head
to
escape
recognition
but
the
urchins
were
all
gaping
at
the
bishop
s
shovel
hat
hot
dog
cried
yelpers
some
hat
to
his
horror
gissing
now
saw
mrs
spaniel
hastening
in
alarm
down
from
the
house
spilling
potatoes
from
her
apron
as
she
ran
he
hurriedly
urged
the
driver
to
proceed
what
terrible
looking
children
observed
the
bishop
who
seemed
fascinated
by
their
stare
really
my
good
sister
he
said
to
mrs
spaniel
who
was
now
panting
by
the
running
board
you
must
gissing
was
looking
for
an
imaginary
object
on
the
floor
of
the
car
to
his
great
relief
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
motor
as
they
started
again
but
he
sat
up
a
little
too
soon
a
simultaneous
roar
of
daddy
burst
from
the
trio
what
was
that
they
were
shouting
at
us
inquired
the
bishop
looking
back
gissing
shook
his
head
he
was
too
overcome
to
speak
chapter
eleven
the
little
chapel
at
dalmatian
heights
sat
upon
a
hill
among
a
grove
of
pines
the
most
romantic
of
all
trees
life
a
powerful
but
clumsy
dramatist
does
not
reject
the
most
claptrap
situations
which
a
sophisticated
playwright
would
discard
as
too
obvious
for
this
sandy
plateau
strewn
with
satiny
pine
needles
was
the
very
horizon
that
had
looked
so
blue
and
beckoning
from
the
little
house
by
the
pond
not
far
away
was
the
great
airedale
estate
which
gissing
had
known
only
at
an
admiring
distance
and
now
he
was
living
him
to
call
upon
the
airedales
and
they
delighted
that
the
chapel
was
to
be
re
opened
had
insisted
upon
his
staying
with
them
the
chapel
in
fact
was
a
special
interest
with
mr
airedale
who
had
been
a
leading
contributor
toward
its
erection
gissing
was
finding
that
life
seemed
to
be
continually
putting
him
into
false
positions
and
now
he
discovered
somewhat
to
his
chagrin
that
the
lovely
little
shrine
of
st
spitz
whose
stained
windows
glowed
like
rubies
in
its
cloister
of
dark
trees
was
rather
a
fashionable
hobby
among
the
wealthy
landowners
of
dalmatian
hills
it
had
been
closed
all
summer
and
they
had
missed
it
the
bishop
in
his
airy
and
indefinite
way
had
not
made
it
quite
plain
that
gissing
was
only
a
lay
reader
and
in
spite
of
his
embarrassed
disclaimers
he
found
himself
introduced
by
mr
airedale
to
the
country
house
clique
as
the
new
vicar
but
at
any
rate
it
was
lucky
that
the
airedales
had
insisted
on
taking
him
in
as
just
as
the
latter
was
leaving
that
there
was
no
stipend
attached
to
the
office
of
lay
reader
fortunately
he
still
had
much
of
the
money
he
had
saved
from
his
salary
as
general
manager
and
whatever
sense
of
anomaly
he
felt
was
quickly
assuaged
by
the
extraordinary
comfort
and
novelty
of
his
environment
in
the
great
airedale
mansion
he
experienced
for
the
first
time
that
ultimate
triumph
of
civilization
a
cup
of
tea
served
in
bed
before
breakfast
with
slices
of
bread
and
butter
of
tenuous
and
amazing
fragile
thinness
he
was
pleased
too
with
the
deference
paid
him
as
a
representative
of
the
cloth
even
though
it
compelled
him
stealthily
approaching
the
agent
s
office
across
the
street
taking
advantage
of
the
deeper
shadows
and
of
the
darkness
between
lightning
flashes
she
stole
to
the
rear
of
the
building
where
she
found
an
unlatched
window
through
which
she
scrambled
with
the
agility
of
a
boy
within
the
place
was
pitch
dark
but
like
one
amid
familiar
surroundings
she
crossed
the
hall
and
found
the
room
she
sought
the
office
room
now
of
moran
but
formerly
occupied
by
simon
barsdale
she
bent
over
the
big
safe
and
was
twirling
the
combination
knob
in
her
slim
cold
fingers
when
she
with
a
gasp
of
fright
she
stood
motionless
listening
acutely
but
there
was
no
further
sound
reassured
she
produced
a
bit
of
candle
which
she
lighted
and
placed
to
one
side
of
the
safe
so
that
the
flame
was
shaded
from
the
windows
she
was
in
the
act
of
manipulating
the
combination
again
when
her
whole
body
rigid
with
fear
she
stood
erect
once
more
holding
her
breath
and
striving
for
self
control
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
noise
this
time
some
one
had
entered
the
adjoining
room
hastily
snuffing
out
the
candle
she
crouched
into
the
darkness
of
a
corner
she
never
doubted
that
the
newcomer
was
race
moran
or
that
he
would
almost
immediately
discover
her
she
tried
to
summon
enough
resolution
to
bluff
things
through
when
the
moment
of
discovery
should
come
but
as
the
seconds
slipped
by
and
the
lights
were
not
turned
on
she
began
to
regain
her
courage
perhaps
moran
was
sitting
in
the
dark
of
the
other
room
smoking
and
thinking
caught
if
she
moved
swiftly
and
silently
she
bent
again
over
the
shining
knob
at
the
same
time
watching
in
the
direction
of
the
door
which
was
still
closed
as
she
had
left
it
it
was
difficult
to
work
the
lock
in
the
dark
and
as
she
became
engrossed
with
her
purpose
she
ceased
temporarily
to
listen
acutely
she
had
just
succeeded
in
effecting
the
combination
when
something
touched
her
side
do
nt
move
a
voice
hissed
behind
her
i
ll
shoot
if
you
do
she
wanted
to
cry
out
please
do
nt
shoot
but
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
which
had
suddenly
gone
dry
she
had
fallen
forward
against
the
door
of
the
safe
and
was
curiously
conscious
how
cold
it
felt
she
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
when
in
a
rush
of
relief
it
dawned
upon
her
that
she
knew
the
voice
it
was
not
moran
s
gordon
she
cried
joyously
had
lost
it
and
scrambling
to
her
feet
it
s
me
dorothy
with
an
exclamation
as
joyous
as
her
own
and
equally
surprised
he
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
peering
through
the
darkness
into
her
face
dorothy
what
the
a
lightning
flash
revealed
them
clearly
to
each
other
i
told
you
not
to
try
this
but
what
are
you
doing
in
town
she
clutched
his
arms
overcome
by
a
fear
greater
than
that
for
her
own
safety
gordon
gordon
you
must
not
stay
here
there
s
a
warrant
out
for
you
no
no
not
for
that
for
the
jensen
shooting
you
ll
be
arrested
on
sight
what
he
stared
at
her
amazed
and
she
nodded
so
that
s
their
game
now
eh
they
ve
stooped
even
to
that
by
god
he
struck
a
match
be
careful
she
warned
him
instantly
see
it
from
the
street
but
oh
gordon
why
did
you
come
he
thrilled
at
the
anxiety
in
her
voice
to
find
out
what
moran
is
hiding
here
and
you
re
after
the
same
thing
of
course
yes
impulsively
he
squeezed
her
fingers
until
she
could
have
cried
out
in
pain
but
for
the
sweetness
of
it
there
are
some
agonies
which
do
not
hurt
her
throat
swelled
with
joy
her
breast
heaved
and
her
eyelids
fluttered
she
was
grateful
for
the
darkness
which
hid
these
outward
signs
of
love
from
him
she
blushed
she
could
feel
the
warm
tide
pulsing
in
her
temples
and
she
laughed
brokenly
from
sheer
happiness
you
should
nt
have
taken
such
a
risk
dorothy
i
told
you
not
to
you
re
taking
that
risk
gordon
and
more
that
s
different
it
s
so
dark
a
night
i
thought
i
d
chance
it
declared
i
can
reach
home
in
five
minutes
is
nt
it
odd
though
that
we
both
should
have
thought
of
doing
it
at
exactly
the
same
time
but
come
gordon
we
must
hurry
now
that
the
safe
was
open
to
remove
its
contents
took
only
a
moment
and
they
tossed
all
the
papers
they
found
into
a
corner
then
when
wade
had
swung
the
safe
around
on
its
casters
they
had
a
snug
shelter
behind
it
where
by
shaded
candle
light
they
ran
rapidly
through
their
loot
most
of
the
documents
related
to
land
purchases
and
development
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
pile
wade
came
upon
a
bundle
of
papers
and
blue
prints
held
together
by
a
rubber
band
which
he
stripped
off
oh
if
we
should
find
nothing
after
all
dorothy
whispered
bending
with
him
over
the
blue
prints
what
are
they
gordon
maps
of
my
own
range
dorothy
his
tone
was
tense
with
excitement
what
do
you
know
about
that
by
heaven
he
fairly
glared
at
the
sheet
before
his
eyes
it
s
all
there
what
s
all
there
what
is
it
gold
he
looked
at
her
in
the
flickering
light
like
a
man
gone
mad
gold
on
your
range
oh
gordon
yes
on
my
range
it
s
inconceivable
almost
but
it
seems
to
be
true
see
look
here
their
heads
were
almost
touching
so
that
her
soft
hair
caressed
his
face
this
is
a
map
of
the
upper
valley
and
the
description
says
these
red
crosses
indicate
the
location
of
gold
one
is
near
the
head
of
piah
creek
not
half
a
mile
from
my
buildings
oh
gordon
i
am
so
glad
dorothy
exclaimed
how
wonderful
it
all
is
you
ll
be
the
boy
s
toes
detected
something
and
he
did
a
pretty
surface
dive
emerging
with
the
bag
strap
in
his
right
hand
he
also
rescued
the
floating
driver
and
we
saw
the
promised
bill
passed
to
him
and
watched
him
drag
on
his
clothes
over
his
wet
undergarments
slowly
even
tenderly
the
somewhat
elderly
gentleman
emptied
the
water
and
the
stone
from
his
bag
and
wiped
the
clubs
on
his
handkerchief
with
the
wet
dripping
burden
over
his
shoulder
he
came
across
the
foot
bridge
and
into
the
locker
room
while
we
hastened
to
remove
our
faces
from
the
door
and
windows
and
attempted
to
appear
casual
he
entered
in
silence
and
strode
to
his
locker
the
silence
grew
painful
somebody
simply
had
to
speak
or
laugh
finally
somebody
did
speak
which
was
probably
the
safer
alternative
decided
to
try
again
eh
the
somewhat
elderly
gentleman
wheeled
upon
the
assemblage
yes
damn
it
he
thundered
well
i
have
never
thrown
my
clubs
into
a
pond
and
i
am
sure
you
have
never
done
anything
so
childish
either
but
how
many
times
have
you
and
i
both
given
up
golf
forever
and
then
returned
to
links
the
following
day
damn
it
we
do
not
play
for
the
exercise
we
do
not
play
because
it
keeps
us
out
in
the
open
air
neither
motive
would
hold
a
man
for
a
week
to
the
tantalizing
costly
soul
racking
nerve
and
temper
destroying
game
we
play
it
because
there
is
some
diabolical
or
celestial
fascination
about
the
thing
some
will
o
the
wisp
of
hope
lures
us
over
swamp
and
swale
through
pit
and
pasture
toward
the
smooth
haven
of
the
putting
green
some
subtle
mysterious
power
every
now
and
then
coordinates
our
muscles
and
lets
us
achieve
perfection
for
a
single
stroke
whereafter
we
tingle
with
remembrance
and
thrill
with
anticipation
golf
is
the
quest
of
unrest
it
spreads
before
us
the
soft
green
pathway
down
which
we
follow
the
gleam
that
is
why
you
and
i
shall
be
giving
it
up
forever
on
our
eightieth
birthday
illustration
grape
vine
erudition
you
may
recall
that
mr
ezra
barkley
acquired
a
great
reputation
for
learning
by
imparting
to
the
spinsters
of
old
chester
such
astonishing
facts
as
the
approximate
number
of
roe
contained
in
a
shad
his
sister
in
law
in
her
ignorance
supposed
there
were
only
two
hundred
ezra
also
knew
who
first
kept
bees
and
many
other
important
things
usually
of
a
statistical
nature
i
can
not
recall
that
mrs
deland
has
told
us
where
ezra
acquired
his
erudition
and
i
used
at
one
time
to
wonder
but
now
i
know
he
read
the
grape
vine
in
the
first
editions
of
our
daily
papers
perhaps
you
do
nt
know
what
grape
vine
is
i
rejoice
in
my
ability
to
tell
you
it
is
the
name
given
by
newspaper
men
to
the
jokes
and
squibs
and
bits
of
information
clipped
making
short
paragraphs
of
varying
lengths
which
are
dropped
in
at
the
bottom
of
a
column
to
fill
up
the
vacant
space
when
the
need
arises
this
need
most
often
arises
in
preparing
the
first
edition
the
one
which
catches
the
early
trains
for
the
country
by
the
time
the
city
edition
goes
to
press
sufficient
news
of
battles
carnage
and
sudden
death
of
politics
and
stock
exchanges
has
been
prepared
to
fill
every
inch
of
available
space
the
city
reader
therefore
sees
little
of
this
grape
vine
thus
we
have
a
new
argument
for
country
life
i
am
now
a
resident
of
the
country
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
removed
from
new
york
and
as
far
from
boston
and
i
am
by
way
of
becoming
nearly
as
erudite
as
ezra
barkley
i
am
indeed
almost
bewildered
with
the
mass
of
information
i
am
acquiring
this
morning
i
read
a
column
about
the
european
war
all
of
which
i
have
now
forgotten
but
how
can
i
ever
forget
bottom
which
filled
out
an
otherwise
vacant
quarter
inch
i
am
permanently
a
wiser
man
many
filipino
women
catch
and
sell
fish
for
a
living
amid
a
world
at
war
too
how
peaceful
and
soothing
is
this
tabloid
idyl
of
piscatorial
toil
after
the
acquisition
of
this
morsel
of
learning
i
set
diligently
to
work
on
the
day
s
papers
both
the
morning
editions
and
those
evening
editions
which
come
to
us
here
by
a
train
leaving
the
city
early
in
the
afternoon
to
see
how
much
erudition
i
could
accumulate
in
one
sun
s
span
i
think
you
of
the
cities
will
be
astonished
i
was
myself
in
a
few
weeks
i
shall
read
the
encyclopaedia
advertisements
with
scorn
instead
of
longing
for
instance
i
have
learned
that
a
new
tooth
brush
is
cylindrical
and
is
revolved
against
the
teeth
by
a
plunger
working
through
its
spirally
grooved
handle
obviously
just
the
implement
for
boys
interested
in
motor
cars
as
all
boys
are
they
will
play
they
are
i
have
learned
that
in
the
last
five
years
our
national
and
state
lawmaking
bodies
have
passed
laws
the
surprising
thing
about
this
information
is
that
the
number
is
so
small
i
have
learned
that
russia
has
ten
thousand
lepers
taken
care
of
by
twenty
one
institutions
i
have
acquired
these
valuable
bits
of
ornithological
lore
the
frigate
bird
is
capable
of
getting
up
a
speed
of
ninety
six
miles
an
hour
with
hardly
a
movement
of
its
wings
the
greater
part
of
its
life
is
spent
in
the
air
the
swallow
has
a
larger
mouth
in
proportion
to
its
size
than
any
other
bird
i
have
from
the
bottom
of
a
single
column
gleaned
these
three
items
of
incalculable
value
by
harnessing
a
fly
to
a
tiny
wagon
an
english
scientist
found
it
could
draw
one
hundred
and
seventy
times
its
own
weight
over
smooth
surfaces
missouri
last
year
produced
tons
of
lead
a
fairly
heavy
output
the
united
states
has
five
hundred
and
with
this
statistical
line
one
paris
motion
picture
plant
produces
an
did
the
smirk
and
smile
of
the
ticket
agent
your
pardon
madam
i
proffered
lifting
my
hat
agreeably
dazzled
while
thus
performing
she
acknowledged
the
tribute
with
a
faint
blush
while
pocketing
my
change
and
stowing
away
my
ticket
i
had
opportunity
to
survey
her
further
benton
she
said
briefly
to
the
agent
we
were
bound
for
the
same
point
then
ye
gods
but
she
was
a
little
beauty
a
perfect
blonde
of
the
petite
and
fully
formed
type
with
regular
features
inclined
to
the
clean
cut
grecian
a
piquant
mouth
deliciously
bowed
two
eyes
a
mass
of
glinting
golden
hair
upon
which
perched
a
ravishing
little
bonnet
the
natural
ensemble
was
enhanced
by
her
costume
all
of
black
from
the
closely
fitting
bodice
to
the
rustling
crinoline
beneath
which
there
peeped
out
tiny
shoes
i
had
opportunity
also
to
note
the
jet
pendant
in
the
shelly
ear
toward
me
and
the
flashing
rings
upon
the
fingers
of
her
hands
ungloved
in
order
to
sort
out
the
money
from
her
reticule
sooth
to
say
i
might
not
stand
there
gawking
once
by
a
demure
sideways
glance
she
betrayed
knowledge
of
my
presence
her
own
transaction
was
all
matter
of
fact
as
if
engaging
passage
to
benton
of
wyoming
territory
contained
no
novelty
for
her
could
she
by
any
chance
live
there
a
woman
dressed
like
she
was
as
much
a
la
mode
as
if
she
walked
broadway
in
new
york
omaha
itself
had
astonished
me
with
the
display
upon
its
streets
and
now
if
benton
far
out
in
the
wilderness
should
prove
another
surprise
indeed
all
strange
to
say
as
soon
as
one
crossed
the
missouri
river
one
began
to
sense
romance
and
to
discover
it
as
seemed
to
me
the
ticket
agent
would
have
detained
her
in
defiance
of
the
waiting
line
but
she
finished
her
business
shortly
with
shorter
replies
to
his
idle
remarks
and
i
turned
away
under
pretense
of
examining
some
placards
upon
the
wall
advertising
platte
valley
lands
for
sale
i
had
curiosity
to
see
which
way
she
wended
then
as
she
tripped
for
the
door
casting
eyes
never
right
nor
left
and
still
fumbling
at
her
reticule
a
coin
slipped
from
her
fingers
and
rolled
by
good
fortune
across
the
floor
i
was
after
it
instantly
caught
it
and
with
best
bow
presented
it
permit
me
madam
she
took
it
thank
you
sir
for
a
moment
she
paused
to
restore
it
to
its
company
and
i
grasped
the
occasion
i
beg
your
pardon
you
are
eyes
met
mine
so
completely
as
well
nigh
to
daze
me
with
their
glory
there
was
a
quizzical
uplift
in
her
frank
arch
smile
i
am
sir
to
benton
city
of
wyoming
territory
you
are
acquainted
there
i
ventured
yes
sir
i
am
acquainted
there
and
you
are
from
benton
oh
no
i
assured
i
am
from
new
york
state
as
if
anybody
might
not
have
known
but
i
have
just
purchased
my
ticket
to
benton
and
i
stammered
i
have
made
bold
to
wonder
if
you
would
not
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
something
of
the
place
as
to
accommodations
and
all
that
you
do
nt
by
any
chance
happen
to
live
there
do
you
and
why
not
sir
may
i
ask
she
challenged
i
floundered
before
her
query
direct
and
her
bewildering
eyes
and
lips
all
tantalizing
i
territory
has
been
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
as
largely
indian
country
at
benton
we
are
only
six
days
behind
new
york
fashions
she
smiled
you
have
not
been
out
over
the
railroad
then
i
suspect
not
to
north
platte
nor
to
cheyenne
i
have
never
been
west
of
cincinnati
before
you
have
surely
been
reading
of
the
railroad
the
pacific
railway
between
the
east
and
california
yes
indeed
in
fact
a
friend
of
mine
named
stephen
clark
nephew
of
the
honorable
thurlow
weed
formerly
of
albany
was
killed
a
year
ago
by
your
indians
while
surveying
west
of
the
black
hills
and
of
course
there
have
been
accounts
in
the
new
york
papers
you
are
not
on
survey
service
or
possibly
yes
no
madam
a
pleasure
trip
to
end
of
track
she
evidently
was
curious
but
i
was
getting
accustomed
to
questions
into
private
matters
that
pleasure
of
finding
health
i
laughed
i
have
been
advised
to
seek
a
location
high
and
dry
oh
she
dimpled
adorably
i
congratulate
you
on
your
choice
you
will
make
no
mistake
then
in
trying
benton
i
can
promise
you
that
it
is
high
and
reasonably
dry
and
as
for
accommodations
so
far
as
i
have
ever
heard
anybody
is
accommodated
there
with
whatever
he
may
wish
she
darted
a
glance
at
me
stepped
aside
as
if
to
leave
i
am
to
understand
that
it
is
a
city
i
pleaded
benton
why
certainly
all
the
world
is
flowing
to
benton
we
gained
three
thousand
people
in
two
weeks
much
to
the
sorrow
of
poor
old
cheyenne
and
laramie
no
doubt
there
are
five
thousand
people
there
now
and
all
busy
yes
a
young
man
will
find
his
opportunities
in
benton
i
think
your
choice
will
please
you
money
is
plentiful
and
so
are
me
another
sparkling
glance
and
since
we
are
both
going
to
benton
i
will
say
au
revoir
sir
she
left
me
quivering
you
do
live
there
i
besought
after
and
received
a
nod
of
the
golden
head
as
she
entered
the
sacred
ladies
waiting
room
until
the
train
should
be
made
up
i
might
only
stroll
restless
and
strangely
buoyed
with
that
vision
of
an
entrancing
fellow
traveler
filling
my
eyes
summoned
in
due
time
by
the
clamor
passengers
for
the
pacific
railway
all
aboard
going
west
on
the
union
pacific
here
amidst
the
platform
hurly
burly
of
men
women
children
and
bundles
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
sight
the
black
clad
figure
of
my
lady
of
the
blue
eyes
hastening
like
the
rest
but
not
unattended
for
a
brakeman
bore
her
valise
and
the
conductor
her
parasol
the
explained
these
men
will
return
at
once
to
hooja
s
island
to
the
mahar
cities
from
which
they
come
or
to
the
countries
from
which
they
were
stolen
by
the
mahars
they
are
men
of
two
races
and
of
many
countries
they
will
spread
the
story
of
our
victory
far
and
wide
and
while
they
are
with
us
we
will
they
may
carry
back
to
their
friends
and
their
chiefs
it
s
the
finest
chance
for
free
publicity
perry
i
added
to
the
old
man
that
you
or
i
have
seen
in
many
a
day
perry
agreed
with
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
would
have
agreed
to
anything
that
would
have
restrained
us
from
killing
the
poor
devils
who
fell
into
our
hands
he
was
a
great
fellow
to
invent
gunpowder
and
fire
arms
and
cannon
but
when
it
came
to
using
these
things
to
kill
people
he
was
as
tender
hearted
as
a
chicken
the
sagoth
who
had
spoken
was
talking
to
other
sagoths
in
his
boat
evidently
they
were
holding
a
council
over
the
question
of
the
wisdom
of
surrender
ing
what
will
become
of
you
if
you
do
nt
surrender
to
us
i
asked
if
we
do
not
open
up
our
batteries
on
you
again
and
kill
you
all
you
will
simply
drift
about
the
sea
helplessly
until
you
die
of
thirst
and
starvation
you
can
as
well
as
we
that
the
natives
there
are
very
numerous
and
warlike
they
would
kill
you
the
moment
you
landed
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
the
boat
of
which
the
sagoth
speaker
was
in
charge
surrendered
the
sagoths
threw
down
their
weapons
and
we
took
them
aboard
the
ship
next
in
line
behind
the
amoz
first
ja
had
to
impress
upon
the
captain
and
crew
of
the
ship
that
the
prisoners
were
not
to
be
abused
or
killed
after
that
the
remaining
dugouts
paddled
up
and
surrendered
we
distributed
them
among
the
entire
fleet
lest
there
be
too
many
upon
any
one
vessel
thus
ended
the
first
real
naval
engagement
that
the
pellucidarian
seas
had
ever
witnessed
though
perry
still
insists
that
the
action
in
which
the
sari
took
part
was
a
battle
of
the
first
magnitude
the
battle
over
and
the
prisoners
disposed
of
and
fed
and
do
not
imagine
that
dian
juag
and
i
as
well
as
the
two
hounds
were
not
fed
also
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
fleet
we
had
the
feluccas
close
of
a
medieval
potentate
on
parade
i
received
the
commanders
of
the
forty
nine
feluccas
that
accompanied
the
flag
ship
dian
and
i
together
the
empress
and
the
emperor
of
pellucidar
it
was
a
great
occasion
the
savage
bronze
warriors
entered
into
the
spirit
of
it
for
as
i
learned
later
dear
old
perry
had
left
no
opportunity
neglected
for
impressing
upon
them
that
david
was
emperor
of
pellucidar
and
that
all
that
they
were
accomplishing
and
all
that
he
was
accomplishing
was
due
to
the
power
and
redounded
to
the
glory
of
david
the
old
man
must
have
rubbed
it
in
pretty
strong
for
those
fierce
warriors
nearly
came
to
blows
in
their
efforts
to
be
among
the
first
of
those
to
kneel
before
me
and
kiss
my
hand
when
it
came
to
kissing
dian
s
i
think
they
enjoyed
it
more
i
know
i
should
have
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
me
as
i
stood
upon
the
little
deck
of
the
amoz
with
the
first
of
perry
s
primi
tive
cannon
behind
me
when
ja
kneeled
at
my
feet
and
first
at
his
side
the
sword
of
hammered
iron
that
perry
had
taught
him
to
fashion
striking
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
i
created
him
king
of
anoroc
each
captain
of
the
forty
nine
other
feluccas
i
made
a
duke
i
left
it
to
perry
to
enlighten
them
as
to
the
value
of
the
honors
i
had
bestowed
upon
them
during
these
ceremonies
raja
and
ranee
had
stood
beside
dian
and
me
their
bellies
had
been
well
filled
but
still
they
had
difficulty
in
permitting
so
much
edible
humanity
to
pass
unchallenged
it
was
a
good
education
for
them
though
and
never
after
did
they
find
it
difficult
to
associate
with
the
human
race
with
out
arousing
their
appetites
after
the
ceremonies
were
over
we
had
a
chance
to
talk
with
perry
and
ja
the
former
told
me
that
ghak
king
of
sari
had
sent
my
letter
and
map
to
him
by
a
runner
and
that
he
and
ja
had
at
once
decided
to
set
out
on
the
completion
of
the
fleet
to
ascertain
the
correctness
of
my
theory
that
the
was
in
reality
the
same
ocean
as
that
which
lapped
the
shores
of
thuria
under
the
name
of
sojar
az
or
great
sea
their
destination
had
been
the
island
retreat
of
hooja
and
they
had
sent
word
to
ghak
of
their
plans
that
we
might
work
in
harmony
with
them
the
tempest
that
had
blown
us
off
the
coast
of
the
continent
had
blown
them
far
to
the
south
also
shortly
before
discovering
us
they
had
come
into
a
great
group
of
islands
from
between
the
largest
two
of
which
they
were
sailing
when
they
saw
hooja
s
fleet
pursuing
our
dugout
i
asked
perry
if
he
had
any
idea
as
to
where
we
were
or
in
what
direction
lay
hooja
s
island
or
the
continent
he
replied
by
producing
his
map
on
which
he
had
carefully
marked
the
newly
discovered
islands
there
described
as
the
unfriendly
isles
which
showed
hooja
s
island
northwest
of
us
about
two
points
west
he
then
explained
that
with
compass
chronometer
log
and
reel
they
had
kept
a
fairly
accurate
record
of
their
of
the
feluccas
were
equipped
with
these
instruments
and
all
of
the
captains
had
been
instructed
in
their
use
i
was
very
greatly
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
these
savages
had
mastered
the
rather
intricate
detail
of
this
unusual
work
but
perry
assured
me
that
they
had
already
gone
through
enough
to
kill
almost
any
woman
and
as
i
gazed
down
at
her
so
small
and
delicate
and
helpless
there
was
born
slowly
within
my
breast
a
new
emotion
it
had
never
been
there
before
now
it
will
never
cease
to
be
there
it
made
me
almost
frantic
in
my
desire
to
find
some
way
to
keep
warm
and
cooling
lifeblood
in
her
veins
i
was
cold
myself
though
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
until
nobbler
moved
and
i
felt
a
new
sensation
of
cold
along
my
leg
against
which
he
had
lain
and
suddenly
realized
that
in
that
one
spot
i
had
been
warm
like
a
great
light
came
the
understanding
knelt
beside
her
to
put
my
scheme
into
practice
when
suddenly
i
was
overwhelmed
with
embarrassment
would
she
permit
it
even
if
i
could
muster
the
courage
to
suggest
it
then
i
saw
her
frame
convulse
shudderingly
her
muscles
reacting
to
her
rapidly
lowering
temperature
and
casting
prudery
to
the
winds
i
threw
myself
down
beside
her
and
took
her
in
my
arms
pressing
her
body
close
to
mine
she
drew
away
suddenly
voicing
a
little
cry
of
fright
and
tried
to
push
me
from
her
forgive
me
i
managed
to
stammer
it
is
the
only
way
you
will
die
of
exposure
if
you
are
not
warmed
and
nobs
and
i
are
the
only
means
we
can
command
for
furnishing
warmth
and
i
held
her
tightly
while
i
called
nobs
and
bade
him
lie
down
at
her
back
the
girl
did
nt
struggle
any
more
when
she
learned
my
purpose
but
she
gave
two
or
three
little
gasps
and
then
began
to
cry
softly
burying
her
chapter
toward
morning
i
must
have
dozed
though
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
that
i
had
lain
awake
for
days
instead
of
hours
when
i
finally
opened
my
eyes
it
was
daylight
and
the
girl
s
hair
was
in
my
face
and
she
was
breathing
normally
i
thanked
god
for
that
she
had
turned
her
head
during
the
night
so
that
as
i
opened
my
eyes
i
saw
her
face
not
an
inch
from
mine
my
lips
almost
touching
hers
it
was
nobs
who
finally
awoke
her
he
got
up
stretched
turned
around
a
few
times
and
lay
down
again
and
the
girl
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
into
mine
hers
went
very
wide
at
first
and
then
slowly
comprehension
came
to
her
and
she
smiled
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
she
said
as
i
helped
her
to
rise
though
if
the
truth
were
known
i
was
more
in
need
of
assistance
than
she
the
circulation
all
along
my
left
been
very
good
to
me
and
that
was
the
only
mention
she
ever
made
of
it
yet
i
know
that
she
was
thankful
and
that
only
reserve
prevented
her
from
referring
to
what
to
say
the
least
was
an
embarrassing
situation
however
unavoidable
shortly
after
daylight
we
saw
smoke
apparently
coming
straight
toward
us
and
after
a
time
we
made
out
the
squat
lines
of
a
tug
one
of
those
fearless
exponents
of
england
s
supremacy
of
the
sea
that
tows
sailing
ships
into
french
and
english
ports
i
stood
up
on
a
thwart
and
waved
my
soggy
coat
above
my
head
nobs
stood
upon
another
and
barked
the
girl
sat
at
my
feet
straining
her
eyes
toward
the
deck
of
the
oncoming
boat
they
see
us
she
said
at
last
there
is
a
man
answering
your
signal
she
was
right
a
lump
came
into
my
throat
for
her
sake
rather
than
for
mine
she
was
saved
and
none
too
soon
she
could
not
have
lived
through
another
night
upon
coming
day
the
tug
came
close
beside
us
and
a
man
on
deck
threw
us
a
rope
willing
hands
dragged
us
to
the
deck
nobs
scrambling
nimbly
aboard
without
assistance
the
rough
men
were
gentle
as
mothers
with
the
girl
plying
us
both
with
questions
they
hustled
her
to
the
captain
s
cabin
and
me
to
the
boiler
room
they
told
the
girl
to
take
off
her
wet
clothes
and
throw
them
outside
the
door
that
they
might
be
dried
and
then
to
slip
into
the
captain
s
bunk
and
get
warm
they
did
nt
have
to
tell
me
to
strip
after
i
once
got
into
the
warmth
of
the
boiler
room
in
a
jiffy
my
clothes
hung
about
where
they
might
dry
most
quickly
and
i
myself
was
absorbing
through
every
pore
the
welcome
heat
of
the
stifling
compartment
they
brought
us
hot
soup
and
coffee
and
then
those
who
were
not
on
duty
sat
around
and
helped
me
damn
the
kaiser
and
his
brood
as
soon
as
our
clothes
were
dry
they
bade
than
fair
in
those
waters
that
we
should
run
into
trouble
with
the
enemy
as
i
was
only
too
well
aware
what
with
the
warmth
and
the
feeling
of
safety
for
the
girl
and
the
knowledge
that
a
little
rest
and
food
would
quickly
overcome
the
effects
of
her
experiences
of
the
past
dismal
hours
i
was
feeling
more
content
than
i
had
experienced
since
those
three
whistle
blasts
had
shattered
the
peace
of
my
world
the
previous
afternoon
but
peace
upon
the
channel
has
been
but
a
transitory
thing
since
august
it
proved
itself
such
that
morning
for
i
had
scarce
gotten
into
my
dry
clothes
and
taken
the
girl
s
apparel
to
the
captain
s
cabin
when
an
order
was
shouted
down
into
the
engine
room
for
full
speed
ahead
and
an
instant
later
i
heard
the
dull
boom
of
a
gun
in
a
moment
i
was
up
on
deck
to
see
an
enemy
submarine
about
two
hundred
yards
off
our
port
bow
she
had
signaled
us
to
stop
and
our
skipper
had
ignored
the
order
but
the
second
shot
grazed
the
cabin
warning
the
belligerent
tug
captain
that
it
was
time
to
obey
once
again
an
order
went
down
to
the
engine
room
and
the
tug
to
be
diverted
by
something
and
one
of
them
my
friend
harry
bolles
who
had
his
handkerchief
up
to
his
mouth
made
a
bee
line
to
meet
me
from
his
lips
i
learned
what
pot
hunter
having
presently
pulled
a
solitary
pickerel
out
upon
the
ice
and
freed
it
from
his
hook
turned
aside
to
cut
another
piece
of
bait
whereupon
my
hopeful
picked
up
the
fish
and
popped
it
back
into
its
native
element
without
so
much
as
a
syllable
of
commentary
and
thereupon
being
act
three
in
the
tragedy
he
of
the
horny
hand
having
realized
the
situation
in
its
terrible
entirety
pulled
up
his
line
shovelled
back
the
particles
of
ice
into
the
hole
and
betook
himself
upon
his
shambling
way
without
one
word
not
a
word
mark
you
there
was
a
real
philosopher
if
you
like
a
thorough
going
square
trotting
philosopher
the
only
alternative
was
child
murder
or
silence
and
my
pot
hunter
chose
the
simplest
form
of
the
dilemma
i
thought
the
fish
would
like
it
said
little
fred
when
interrogated
upon
the
subject
and
yet
despite
my
occasional
inability
to
practice
what
i
preach
josephine
is
correct
in
her
diagnosis
that
my
cast
of
mind
is
becoming
more
i
am
the
author
of
four
children
two
strapping
sons
and
two
tall
daughters
anyone
of
whom
may
constitute
me
a
grandfather
before
i
am
fifty
renders
me
conservative
and
disposed
metaphorically
speaking
to
draw
in
my
horns
a
little
i
am
beginning
to
go
to
church
again
for
instance
you
may
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
i
have
been
regular
in
my
attendance
at
the
sanctuary
certainly
i
have
never
been
a
scoffer
but
on
the
other
hand
i
must
confess
that
somehow
it
has
come
to
pass
since
josephine
and
i
plighted
our
troth
that
our
pew
has
stood
empty
on
the
lord
s
day
oftener
than
the
orthodox
consider
fitting
and
the
worst
of
it
is
i
used
to
attend
service
about
every
other
sabbath
before
i
became
a
benedict
and
josephine
taught
a
sunday
school
class
up
to
within
six
months
of
our
wedding
ceremony
she
dear
girl
has
harbored
ever
since
the
belief
that
she
continues
to
go
to
church
almost
every
sunday
either
in
the
morning
or
i
took
no
pains
to
dispel
knowing
as
i
did
that
she
meant
to
go
every
sunday
yet
i
knew
also
that
pitiless
unemotional
statistics
would
reveal
an
average
attendance
on
her
part
of
rather
less
than
ten
times
in
the
course
of
each
year
i
was
brute
enough
finally
to
call
attention
to
a
tally
sheet
covering
a
period
of
three
calendar
months
which
i
had
kept
for
my
private
edification
and
i
was
punished
by
seeing
her
sweet
eyes
fill
with
tears
before
she
proceeded
to
plead
to
the
indictment
you
know
fred
perfectly
well
that
i
have
to
stay
at
home
with
the
children
every
other
sunday
morning
in
order
to
allow
lucille
to
go
to
church
but
how
about
the
other
mornings
and
all
the
afternoons
i
inquired
with
the
effrontery
of
a
hardened
sinner
seizing
his
opportunity
to
take
a
saint
to
task
josephine
blushed
partly
from
guilt
and
partly
from
indignation
it
rained
torrents
last
sunday
morning
and
sunday
morning
fortnight
er
i
was
sick
afternoon
when
old
mr
philipps
called
and
i
did
nt
like
to
leave
him
besides
i
feel
as
though
i
ought
to
stay
at
home
occasionally
on
sunday
afternoons
in
order
to
teach
the
children
the
scriptures
the
sunday
morning
before
that
er
i
went
no
it
must
have
been
a
fortnight
previous
for
i
recollect
now
that
i
had
planned
to
go
when
you
said
that
you
hated
to
skate
alone
and
declined
to
take
the
entire
responsibility
of
the
children
on
the
pond
on
account
of
little
fred
and
the
pickerel
and
i
said
too
i
remember
that
in
all
probability
there
would
nt
be
black
ice
again
all
winter
you
did
you
did
my
darling
cried
with
tragic
impetuosity
and
it
is
cruel
of
you
to
remind
me
of
it
moreover
it
was
a
correct
prophecy
it
snowed
that
very
night
and
the
people
who
waited
until
monday
were
nowhere
oh
fred
fred
i
m
a
wicked
who
ought
to
tax
me
with
it
but
it
is
true
i
do
nt
go
to
church
as
i
ought
and
yet
i
do
mean
to
go
but
if
it
is
nt
one
thing
which
prevents
it
s
another
lucille
must
have
every
other
sunday
morning
and
you
seem
so
disappointed
if
i
refuse
to
go
skating
or
canoeing
with
you
and
the
children
on
the
fine
days
that
i
foolishly
yield
and
you
the
daughter
of
a
deacon
i
continued
unsparingly
let
me
state
by
way
of
explanation
that
josephine
s
late
father
was
for
many
years
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
religious
society
to
which
he
belonged
i
know
i
know
it
is
shameful
i
we
are
little
better
than
heathens
fred
only
think
of
it
four
times
in
three
months
she
added
glancing
at
the
tell
tale
sheet
and
i
brought
up
to
go
regularly
both
morning
and
afternoon
in
addition
to
sunday
school
i
am
a
heathen
and
as
for
she
exclaimed
with
a
sad
reproachful
smile
so
long
as
josephine
was
content
to
berate
herself
without
including
me
in
her
anathemas
i
had
been
ready
to
acquiesce
in
what
she
said
but
now
that
she
seemed
disposed
to
drag
me
into
the
conversation
i
felt
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
reply
with
dignity
will
you
please
explain
my
dear
why
it
is
that
though
i
used
to
be
a
regular
worshipper
before
we
became
man
and
wife
i
have
almost
entirely
ceased
to
attend
church
since
that
time
who
is
responsible
for
the
change
i
wonder
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
it
is
not
safe
to
prod
josephine
and
i
could
see
from
the
expression
of
her
eye
that
we
had
reached
it
jenks
plainly
puzzled
where
s
the
other
in
the
boat
said
letty
we
brought
this
ashore
because
the
boys
wanted
to
play
jungle
travelers
and
carry
things
slung
on
a
pole
over
their
shoulders
captain
jenks
laughed
as
he
marshaled
the
children
on
the
boat
i
suppose
uncle
silas
will
be
put
out
over
the
boat
being
lost
said
letty
thoughtfully
pulling
nelson
and
albert
out
of
the
captain
s
way
as
he
started
the
engine
he
had
just
painted
it
and
the
oarlocks
were
new
this
year
i
wish
i
had
made
sure
that
knot
was
tied
no
use
grieving
over
what
s
done
and
past
said
captain
jenks
wisely
meg
we
re
going
to
lose
dot
overboard
again
if
she
is
nt
removed
from
that
railing
sure
enough
there
was
dot
half
way
over
the
railing
her
small
sandals
hooked
around
a
cleat
in
an
endeavor
to
keep
her
balance
just
as
meg
opened
her
mouth
to
call
her
she
turned
ship
ahoy
she
cried
trying
to
imitate
captain
jenk
s
most
nautical
term
starboard
or
port
asked
the
captain
gravely
though
his
eyes
twinkled
the
four
navigation
in
the
few
weeks
they
had
known
the
captain
but
dot
was
too
excited
to
remember
what
she
had
learned
it
s
right
here
she
shouted
oh
you
ll
run
into
it
the
rowboat
the
rowboat
cried
letty
dancing
up
and
down
oh
captain
jenks
what
do
you
think
of
that
it
s
uncle
silas
s
boat
and
the
oar
is
in
it
and
our
sweaters
and
everything
fine
but
do
nt
lose
your
heads
said
captain
jenks
placidly
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
agitated
bobby
you
take
the
wheel
and
hold
it
steady
bobby
proudly
took
the
wheel
and
captain
jenks
while
the
others
watched
breathlessly
brought
the
rowboat
alongside
with
a
long
iron
hook
and
with
another
drew
up
the
long
rope
that
was
tied
to
an
iron
ring
in
the
prow
then
the
rowboat
was
fastened
to
the
stern
of
the
sarah
and
as
captain
jenks
remarked
on
apple
tree
island
and
the
four
little
blossoms
were
put
ashore
after
saying
good
by
to
letty
blake
and
her
cousins
she
lived
in
greenpier
and
captain
jenks
had
known
her
since
she
was
dot
s
age
let
s
have
lunch
ready
by
the
time
daddy
and
mother
come
back
suggested
meg
we
can
do
it
every
bit
ourselves
working
like
four
beavers
they
soon
had
lunch
and
a
good
lunch
too
set
out
on
the
table
they
had
promised
never
to
light
the
oil
stove
so
they
could
not
make
tea
but
mother
blossom
could
do
that
in
a
very
few
minutes
when
she
came
when
the
table
was
ready
meg
ran
out
for
some
red
clover
and
tall
grasses
for
a
bouquet
and
bobby
followed
her
leaving
dot
and
twaddles
alone
i
think
we
ought
to
have
some
jelly
on
the
table
do
nt
you
said
dot
we
never
have
enough
jelly
mother
likes
currant
you
get
it
and
i
never
lets
me
have
the
can
opener
dot
got
a
chair
and
climbed
up
on
it
she
was
just
able
to
reach
the
shelf
in
the
closet
where
the
tumblers
of
jelly
were
kept
she
knew
that
currant
jelly
was
red
and
she
handed
down
a
ruby
red
glass
to
the
waiting
twaddles
do
nt
cut
yourself
she
admonished
him
as
he
punched
the
can
opener
into
the
tin
lid
twaddles
and
dot
did
not
know
that
jelly
tumblers
are
not
opened
with
can
openers
mother
blossom
and
norah
always
pried
off
the
tin
lids
and
used
them
the
next
year
for
other
glasses
oh
gee
there
s
a
lot
of
wax
on
top
twaddles
reported
when
he
had
torn
a
jagged
hole
in
the
lid
and
found
the
jelly
was
protected
with
a
layer
of
paraffin
how
ll
i
get
that
off
take
a
fork
advised
dot
here
i
ll
show
you
she
seized
a
fork
and
jammed
it
into
the
paraffin
bits
twaddles
clean
blouse
and
plentifully
decorating
dot
s
white
apron
mother
s
coming
cried
meg
rushing
into
the
kitchen
with
her
flowers
then
she
stopped
dot
blossom
look
what
you
re
done
she
wailed
well
there
was
not
much
use
in
scolding
after
it
was
done
and
daddy
and
mother
blossom
said
that
since
the
twins
had
been
so
good
about
helping
to
get
lunch
that
they
should
not
be
punished
beyond
having
to
go
without
any
jelly
for
that
meal
of
course
the
four
little
blossoms
had
a
great
deal
to
tell
about
the
children
they
had
helped
captain
jenks
to
rescue
from
kidd
s
island
daddy
and
mother
blossom
had
seen
the
captain
in
greenpier
and
already
knew
of
the
rescue
but
did
not
know
many
of
the
details
that
the
children
now
gave
them
we
saw
mr
harley
said
mother
blossom
bringing
out
her
darning
basket
after
lunch
to
one
of
the
pretty
trees
where
the
family
were
fond
of
sitting
meg
yesterday
when
we
were
playing
at
mr
harley
s
house
we
found
a
little
hobby
horse
that
must
have
belonged
to
one
of
the
boys
i
s
pose
there
was
nt
room
for
it
in
the
trunk
i
do
nt
think
poor
mrs
harley
packed
a
trunk
sighed
mother
blossom
mr
harley
says
he
believes
she
walked
out
of
the
house
and
took
nothing
with
her
except
the
clothes
she
wore
she
had
a
suitcase
of
things
for
the
children
polly
said
and
that
was
all
well
if
that
s
the
case
it
s
funny
we
ca
nt
find
a
clue
remarked
daddy
blossom
i
ve
looked
and
i
know
dick
has
looked
everywhere
for
some
kind
of
note
or
even
a
letter
she
might
have
left
there
is
nt
a
scrap
to
build
on
a
few
days
after
this
daddy
blossom
announced
that
he
was
going
to
greenpier
on
important
business
i
know
daddy
shouted
father
blossom
was
going
over
on
the
morning
boat
to
do
for
an
american
at
all
she
said
struck
with
the
idea
she
added
casually
except
